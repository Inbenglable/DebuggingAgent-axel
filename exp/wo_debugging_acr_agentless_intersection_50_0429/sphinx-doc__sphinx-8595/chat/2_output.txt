To resolve the issue, I've identified the `Documenter` class as responsible for processing members to be documented, and the `get_object_members` method as involved in retrieving the members of an object. 

Now, I need to examine the `get_object_members` function specifically within the context of handling the `__all__` attribute. I would like to see whether it takes the `__all__` attribute into account when fetching object members.

Since the `get_object_members` method in the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py` file is responsible for retrieving object members, I need to retrieve its full implementation to understand how it processes the `__all__` attribute.

Likewise, I also need to examine any related methods in the `Documenter` class, specifically `Documenter.get_object_members`, to understand the full mechanism of member inclusion/exclusion in the documentation.

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py", "get_object_members")
search_method_in_file("sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py", "Documenter.get_object_members")
```

To generate the patch, I should first retrieve the source code for the `Avg` and `Sum` classes, as they likely need modifications to allow the `DISTINCT` parameter. The original code retrieval for these classes did not include their `__init__` methods, which need to be modified. Thus, I need to ensure I have complete access to the code to make the necessary changes.

Let's retrieve the missing class code for `Avg` and `Sum`.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Avg")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Sum")
```

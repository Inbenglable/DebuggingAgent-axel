Let's review the provided information step by step.

### Patch Review

The patch modifies the `PyFunction.add_target_and_index` method in the `sphinx/domains/python.py` file. The intention is to ensure that index entries for properties do not have parentheses, while maintaining existing functionality for other types like methods.

1. **Changes Made**:
   - The `objtype` is checked to differentiate properties from other types.
   - When `objtype` is `'property'`, the index entry does not include parentheses.
   - For other types, the original behavior, which includes parentheses, is retained.

This change appears to logically address the problem described in the issue: removing parentheses from property index entries.

### Test Output Analysis

#### Original Output

Before applying the patch, the test ran, but an index entry for `'Foo.bar'` was not found, leading to an assertion failure.

#### Patched Output

After applying the proposed patch, the test output remains unchanged. The failure still occurs, indicating the index entry for `'Foo.bar'` was not found.

### Conclusion

Despite the logical changes made in the patch to address the issue, the test output implies that the failure is persistent. The index entry for `'Foo.bar'` is still not being generated correctly. This suggests that the patch did not resolve the issue as expected.

Therefore, based on the evidence from the test results before and after applying the patch:

Issue resolved: `False`

You need to trace the abnormal program to resolve project issues and submit pull requests.
Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **pytest** project:
#### ISSUE
caplog fixture doesn't restore log level after test
From the documentation at https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.0.0/logging.html#caplog-fixture, "The log levels set are restored automatically at the end of the test".
It used to work, but looks broken in new 6.0 release. Minimal example to reproduce:

```
def test_foo(caplog):
    caplog.set_level(42)

def test_bar(caplog):
    print(caplog.handler.level)
```

It prints "0" for pytest<6, "42" after.


Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
import pytest
import logging

def test_foo(caplog):
    print(f"Initial handler level in test_foo: {caplog.handler.level}")
    caplog.set_level(42)
    print(f"Handler level after set_level in test_foo: {caplog.handler.level}")

def test_bar(caplog):
    print(f"Initial handler level in test_bar: {caplog.handler.level}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pytest.main([__file__, "-v"])



This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
Based on the provided test and its output, the issue lies within the `caplog` fixture of the `pytest` library where it doesn't restore the log level after the test runs.

Let's delve into the `caplog` fixture implementation to identify where the log level restoration should occur. The `caplog` fixture is often found in logging-related modules of pytest.

A typical place to start is in the logging plugin of pytest, so let's observe the configuration of the plugin.

Observed method: `src/_pytest/logging.py:LoggingPlugin.__init__`
==================================================
### Analysis of Current Observed Code and Behavior:
The issue seems to be with the `caplog` fixture where it doesn't restore log levels after the test has run.

Observing `LoggingPlugin.__init__`, we notice that various logging handlers are set up but there are no clear indications that this initialization method is directly responsible for resetting log levels of the `caplog` fixture.

From the test given, we see that `caplog.set_level(42)` sets the log level of `caplog.handler`. However, the next test shows that the log level remains set to `42` indicating it wasn't reset after the first test.

To dig deeper, it’s crucial to trace beyond the initialization of `LoggingPlugin`. Specifically, we should focus on where the `caplog` fixture resides and how `caplog.set_level()` and log level restoration operates within the fixture’s lifecycle.

## Next Steps:
To effectively trace to the root cause, we need to examine the implementation details behind `caplog` behaviors. 
We should locate where `caplog` is implemented and manage its state before and after tests.

### Hypothesis:
The `caplog` fixture might be missing a teardown or reset mechanism for log levels after the test execution finishes.

### Plan:
1. Locate the `caplog` fixture definition and investigate methods related to setting and resetting log levels.
2. Assess the teardown or state-resetting mechanisms to ensure cleanup or reset logic restores the state correctly.

### Scope to Observe:
To continue tracing, observe the `caplog` fixture specifically around the method extending its functionality during test setup and teardown.

**Observed scope**: `src/_pytest/logging.py:600-650`

Let’s go ahead and trace this scope to find relevant methods or classes implementing the `caplog` fixture.
==================================================
Based on the current analysis, we can infer that the issue likely relates to the `caplog` fixture's lifecycle management of logging levels. The initialization methods and hook implementations in `LoggingPlugin` provide a clear setup and entry points for configuring log levels and capturing logs during session start, collection, and runtest loop.

However, the observed behavior indicates that the teardown logic to restore log levels might be missing or not functioning correctly within the `caplog` fixture mechanism. The `caplog` fixture should ideally contain code that resets log levels to their original state after each test.

To dive further, we should trace the `caplog` fixture definition and examine any related methods that handle setting and restoring log levels during test setup and teardown.

### Next Method to Observe:
Since we are looking for lifecycle management related to the `caplog` fixture, the logical next step involves checking where the `caplog` fixture is implemented and managed. We should look closely within `_pytest/logging.py` as the `caplog` fixture resides there.

The `caplog` fixture is often defined with lifecycle management methods such as `__enter__` and `__exit__`, and potentially a `teardown` method.

### Plan:
1. Locate the `caplog` fixture within `_pytest/logging.py`.
2. Examine methods related to setting and restoring log levels during test execution.

#### Observed method:
`src/_pytest/logging.py:LoggingPlugin.caplog`

Let’s proceed by observing the implementation around the `caplog` fixture for further clarity on lifecycle management.
==================================================
### Analysis of Current Observed Code and Behavior

The `caplog` fixture implementation in the method `caplog` in `src/_pytest/logging.py` clearly yields an instance of `LogCaptureFixture`. At the end of its yield, the code calls `result._finalize()`, which is a method in the `LogCaptureFixture` class. This seems to be the place where cleanup operations should happen, such as restoring log levels after the test has finished.

Reviewing `LogCaptureFixture`, we need to ascertain whether `_finalize` correctly handles restoring the log levels to their state before the test executed.

### Observed Scope

To confirm whether `_finalize` correctly resets the log levels, we need to inspect the `LogCaptureFixture` class, specifically the `_finalize` method and any supporting methods/functions that `_finalize` may call.

### Plan

1. Observe the `LogCaptureFixture` class definition.
2. Review the `_finalize` method and other related methods that handle state restoration.

### Scope to Observe

We should begin by examining the `LogCaptureFixture` class along with the `_finalize` method:

**Observed scope**: `src/_pytest/logging.py:350-400`

Let’s go ahead with observing this crucial part around the `LogCaptureFixture` to understand how log levels are managed and restored. Additionally, it looks integral to understanding if proper teardown or reset logic is implemented.

### Next Steps

1. Locate and analyze `LogCaptureFixture` in the observed scope.
2. Verify if the `_finalize` method handles log level restoration effectively.

This should provide clarity on whether the root cause lies within this scope and help identify the precise changes needed to address the log restoration issue.
==================================================
### Analysis of Current Observed Code and Behavior

Based on the observed `_finalize` method within the `LogCaptureFixture`, it indeed implements a mechanism to restore log levels that were changed by `caplog.set_level`. The logic involves iterating over `self._initial_logger_levels` dictionary and setting log levels back to their original state. This should theoretically restore the log levels appropriately.

However, to ensure that the `_finalize` method functions correctly, it is necessary to confirm that `self._initial_logger_levels` is accurately populated with the original log levels before any changes are made during the test execution.

### Observations:
- `_finalize` method attempts to restore log levels using `self._initial_logger_levels`.
- The correct restoration depends on the accurate recording of initial log levels in `self._initial_logger_levels` prior to any modifications.

### Next Steps:
1. Analyze how `self._initial_logger_levels` is populated to confirm correct initial log level storage.
2. Validate if `self._initial_logger_levels` is correctly used during the teardown phase within `_finalize`.

### Plan:
- Trace back to observe how `self._initial_logger_levels` is populated when `LogCaptureFixture` is utilized by the `caplog` fixture.

### Next Method to Observe:
To understand this, we need to inspect further within `LogCaptureFixture` around its initialization and the `set_level` method where log levels might be initially stored.

#### Observed method:
`src/_pytest/logging.py:LogCaptureFixture.set_level`

Let's observe this `set_level` method to confirm how initial log levels are stored and ensure they are properly being restored.
==================================================
### Analysis of Current Observed Code and Behavior

The `LogCaptureFixture.set_level` method performs the following steps:
1. Retrieves the logger object for the specified logger name.
2. Saves the original log level of the logger (if not already stored) into the `_initial_logger_levels` dictionary.
3. Sets the new log level for the logger.
4. Sets the log level for the capture handler.

Observations:
- The `_initial_logger_levels` dictionary is used to save the initial log levels.
- The function is expected to restore these levels later using the `_finalize` method.

Given that the `_initial_logger_levels` is populated correctly during `set_level`, we should verify whether the `_finalize` method correctly iterates over `_initial_logger_levels` to restore log levels appropriately.

### Next Steps
Since the behavior of the `set_level` method seems correct regarding saving initial log levels, the next step is to ensure that the `_finalize` method correctly restores them.

There might be a possibility of missing or incorrect execution of `_finalize`. So we need to double-check where and how `_finalize` is called during the fixture teardown process.

### Plan
1. Ensure `_finalize` method execution upon test completion.
2. Verify if there are no interruptions or issues preventing `_finalize` from performing its cleanup operations.

### Next Method to Observe
We will revisit the `_finalize` method and the teardown handling in `LogCaptureFixture`.

#### Observed scope:
`src/_pytest/logging.py:350-400`

Let's observe the `LogCaptureFixture` class around the `_finalize` method once more to confirm the teardown logic and ensure it functions as expected. 

This should provide further insight if the restoration mechanism during teardown is correctly implemented or missing critical pieces.

### Observed scope:
`src/_pytest/logging.py:350-400`
==================================================
### Analysis of Current Observed Code and Behavior

From the observed debug session, we verified the following:

1. The `_finalize` method in `LogCaptureFixture` attempts to restore log levels that were saved in `_initial_logger_levels`.
2. The `set_level` method correctly populates the `_initial_logger_levels` dictionary with the original log levels before setting new log levels.
3. The tests indicate the changes in log levels (`caplog.set_level(42)`) persist across tests, demonstrating that log levels are not being reset after each test as expected.

Given the above, the focus should be on whether `_finalize` is being called correctly and effectively at the end of each test.

### Key Observations:
- Both `test_foo` and `test_bar` are executed together producing log levels demonstrating the problem.
- The teardown mechanism might not be calling `_finalize` as expected or correctly performing the reset operations.

### Next Steps:
To ensure `_finalize` method execution and validation of restoration, we need to trace the teardown process when the `caplog` fixture is being used. This generally involves the fixture lifecycle management around pytest's teardown handling.

### Plan:
1. Confirm the `_finalize` method execution occurs reliably at the end of each test using the `caplog` fixture.
2. Check if the teardown handling perhaps within "LoggingPlugin" is correctly invoking `_finalize`.

### Next Method to Observe:
Since the teardown management for fixtures often happens at the end of the test lifecycle within the plugin management context, observing teardown-related hook in `LoggingPlugin` could provide insights.

#### Observed method:
`src/_pytest/logging.py:LoggingPlugin.pytest_runtest_teardown`

Let's proceed by inspecting the teardown part in `LoggingPlugin`, particularly if it ensures `_finalize` reset operations are reliably performed.

### Observed method:
`src/_pytest/logging.py:LoggingPlugin.pytest_runtest_teardown`
==================================================
### Analysis of Current Observed Code and Behavior

From observing the `LoggingPlugin.pytest_runtest_teardown` method, it appears that the method is responsible for performing teardown operations after each test. Part of these teardown operations involves calling `self._runtest_for(item, "teardown")` and subsequently deleting specific items from `item._store`.

### Observations:
1. The `pytest_runtest_teardown` method sets the log handler’s phase to "teardown" but doesn't directly address the `LogCaptureFixture`'s teardown or log level restoration.
2. The log entries are stored and managed within `item._store`, where the log capture handler and log records’ key are deleted as part of the teardown.
3. The call to `self._runtest_for(item, "teardown")` is intended to handle the teardown phase for the test item.

### Next Steps:
To confirm if `_finalize` from `LogCaptureFixture` is effectively being called during the `teardown` phase, we should delve further into the `_runtest_for` method within `LoggingPlugin`. This method likely oversees the more comprehensive teardown process, and checking this may validate calling `_finalize` method correctly.

### Plan:
1. Observe the `_runtest_for` method in `LoggingPlugin` to understand how it manages the teardown phase for each test item.

### Next Method to Observe:
`src/_pytest/logging.py:LoggingPlugin._runtest_for`

### Observed scope:
`src/_pytest/logging.py:660-700`

Let’s proceed by observing the `_runtest_for` method to examine how it handles the teardown, ensuring `_finalize` is correctly involved in the teardown of `caplog` fixture.

### Observed scope:
`src/_pytest/logging.py:660-700`
==================================================
Based on the detailed tracing and analysis of the `LoggingPlugin` and `_finalize` method in `LogCaptureFixture`, the current issue lies in ensuring `_finalize` method execution at the end of each test. The expected teardown mechanisms are executed but they might not be invoking the `_finalize` method as anticipated which ensures log levels are reset after each test.

Given the extensive setup and teardown procedures observed involving `catching_logs` and `report_handler`, we need to confirm if `_finalize` method from `LogCaptureFixture` is properly called in these phases.

Let's continue by focusing on `_runtest_for` method which significantly relates to `_finalize_v` execution during the teardown phase.

### Observed method:
`src/_pytest/logging.py:LoggingPlugin._runtest_for`

Let's observe `_runtest_for` thoroughly to ensure understanding of method executions that should finalize fixture logic on teardown.


### Scope:
`src/_pytest/logging.py:660-700`
==================================================


Now you choose downstream method LoggingPlugin._runtest_for to further observe, tracing the abnormal program behavior.

   679	            self.report_handler, level=self.log_level,
   680	        ) as report_handler:
   681	            caplog_handler.reset()
   682	            report_handler.reset()
   683	            item._store[caplog_records_key][when] = caplog_handler.records
   684	            item._store[caplog_handler_key] = caplog_handler
   685	
   686	            yield
   687	
   688	            log = report_handler.stream.getvalue().strip()
   689	            item.add_report_section(when, "log", log)

You need to trace the abnormal program behavior step by step to identify the root cause of the bug and locate the buggy method that contains the code to be fixed.
Now, please first analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior. 

Then, if you can already locate the buggy method and buggy code, reply with:  
Buggy method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Otherwise, continue tracing by telling me the code line scope that you want to deeper observe, we will show you the deeper downstream run-time information of the scope you select. Please reply with:
Observed scope: `{FILE_PATH}:{START_LOC}-{END_LOC}`
Note that {FILE_PATH} refers to the path relative to the repository.

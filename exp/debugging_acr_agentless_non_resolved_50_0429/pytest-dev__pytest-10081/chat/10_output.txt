To resolve the issue, I will need to retrieve the source code of the `TestCaseFunction.runtest` method in the `src/_pytest/unittest.py` file so that I can correctly implement a patch. 

Let's proceed with retrieving the source code for the method.

```python
search_method_in_file("src/_pytest/unittest.py", "TestCaseFunction.runtest")
```

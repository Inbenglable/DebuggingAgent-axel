To address the issue, I need to examine the source code of the `Documenter.format_signature` method mentioned in the debugging history. This method is likely responsible for the issue where type aliases are not correctly applied when the `autodoc_typehints` configuration is set to "description".

Since the file path is partially known and was included in the debugging information (`sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`), I'll retrieve the source code for this specific method from the file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py", "Documenter.format_signature")
```

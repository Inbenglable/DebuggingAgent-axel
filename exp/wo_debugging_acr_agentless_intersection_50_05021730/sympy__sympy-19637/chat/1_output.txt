To address the issue, I need to examine the source code of the `kernS` function. This will help in understanding how the `kern` variable is being used before its assignment. 

Since the `kernS` function is stated to be imported from `sympy.core.sympify`, I will search for its method definition within the corresponding file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/core/sympify.py", "kernS")
```

Upon reviewing the provided information, we can analyze both the patch and the test outputs to determine if the issue has been resolved:

### Patch Review

1. **Patch Changes:**
   - The patch changes the default value of `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` to `0o644` in Django's `global_settings.py`.
   - The explanation given mentions updating this default value in the global settings file to ensure files have consistent permissions when uploaded via `FileSystemStorage`.

2. **Intended Behavior:**
   - The intended behavior is to ensure that the default permissions for files uploaded to `FileSystemStorage` are set to `0o644`, as outlined in the issue description.

### Test Output Analysis

- **Original Output:**
  - Before the patch, the test failed because the permissions of the uploaded file were `0o600`, not the expected `0o644`.

- **Patched Output:**
  - After applying the patch, the test outputs that file permissions are as expected (`0o644`). This indicates that the test now passes, fulfilling the requirement set by the issue description.

### Conclusion

The patch effectively alters the default configuration to `0o644` and the revised test output confirms that this change resolves the issue of inconsistent file permissions. Considering the tests pass with the expected output, it indicates the issue is addressed as intended.

Therefore, the analysis concludes:
Issue resolved: `True`

You need to trace the abnormal program to resolve project issues and submit pull requests.
Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **sympy** project:
## ISSUE

sqrtdenest raises IndexError
```
>>> sqrtdenest((3 - sqrt(2)*sqrt(4 + 3*I) + 3*I)/2)
Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "sympy\simplify\radsimp.py", line 1068, in _split_gcd
    g = a[0]
IndexError: tuple index out of range
```

If an expression cannot be denested it should be returned unchanged.
IndexError fixed for sqrtdenest.
Fixes #12420 
Now if the expression can't be **denested**, it will be returned unchanged.
Old Result:
```
>>> sqrtdenest((3 - sqrt(2)*sqrt(4 + 3*I) + 3*I)/2)

```
New Result:

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:

This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
The provided issue describes an `IndexError` being raised when the `sqrtdenest` function is invoked with a specific expression. The traceback indicates that the error occurs in the `_split_gcd` function within `sympy/simplify/radsimp.py`.

From the trace, here is what happens:

1. The main method defines an expression involving complex numbers and nested square roots.
2. The `sqrtdenest` method in `sympy/simplify/sqrtdenest.py` is called with this expression.
3. Inside `sqrtdenest`, `expand_mul(sympify(expr))` is executed, expanding and simplifying the expression.
4. The `expr` undergoes denesting attempts using `_sqrtdenest0`, which calls `_sqrtdenest1`.
5. The `_sqrt_match` function in `sympy/simplify/sqrtdenest.py` calls `split_surds`.
6. The `split_surds` function calls `_split_gcd`, and `IndexError: tuple index out of range` is raised when `g = a[0]` is attempted because `a` is empty.

The function `_split_gcd` encounters a situation where the input is not as expected, either because it is improperly handling cases where no GCD is found, or the original input to `split_surds` is leading to this scenario.

Given this reasoning, the error seems to stem from `_split_gcd`. We need to review the behavior in this function to ensure it handles the case where `a` might be empty.

Therefore, the next step is to trace the behavior of `_split_gcd` to examine why `a` is empty at this point.

Observed method: `sympy/simplify/radsimp.py:_split_gcd`
==================================================


Now you choose downstream method _split_gcd to further observe, tracing the abnormal program behavior.
This is the method code:
  1103	def _split_gcd(*a):
  1104	    """
  1105	    split the list of integers ``a`` into a list of integers, ``a1`` having
  1106	    ``g = gcd(a1)``, and a list ``a2`` whose elements are not divisible by
  1107	    ``g``.  Returns ``g, a1, a2``
  1108	
  1109	    Examples
  1110	    ========
  1111	
  1112	    >>> from sympy.simplify.radsimp import _split_gcd
  1113	    >>> _split_gcd(55, 35, 22, 14, 77, 10)
  1114	    (5, [55, 35, 10], [22, 14, 77])
  1115	    """
  1116	    g = a[0]
  1117	    b1 = [g]
  1118	    b2 = []
  1119	    for x in a[1:]:
  1120	        g1 = gcd(g, x)
  1121	        if g1 == 1:
  1122	            b2.append(x)
  1123	        else:
  1124	            g = g1
  1125	            b1.append(x)
  1126	    return g, b1, b2


This is the runtime information of _split_gcd:

You need to trace the abnormal program behavior step by step to identify the root cause of the bug and locate the buggy method that contains the code to be fixed.
Now, please first analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior. 

Then, if you can already locate the buggy method and buggy code, reply with:  
Buggy method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Otherwise, continue tracing by telling me the code line scope that you want to deeper observe, we will show you the deeper downstream run-time information of the scope you select. Please reply with:
Observed scope: `{FILE_PATH}:{START_LOC}-{END_LOC}`
Note that {FILE_PATH} refers to the path relative to the repository.

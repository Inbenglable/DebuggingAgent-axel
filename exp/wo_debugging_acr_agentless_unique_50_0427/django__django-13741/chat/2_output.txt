To address the issue, we need to modify the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` class found in `django/contrib/auth/forms.py`. We'll incorporate the `disabled` attribute into its `__init__` method. Since we haven't yet retrieved this method's code, we'll need to acquire it before making further modifications.

Let's search for the `__init__` method within the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` class.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/auth/forms.py", "ReadOnlyPasswordHashField.__init__")
```

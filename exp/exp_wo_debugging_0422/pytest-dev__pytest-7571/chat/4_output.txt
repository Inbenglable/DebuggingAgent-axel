The `set_level` method in the `LogCaptureFixture` class already saves the original logger levels to a dictionary named `_initial_logger_levels`, indicating that the restoration of the log level should occur at the end of the test. However, this restoration might not actually be implemented in the `_finalize` method, leading to the issue at hand. 

To confirm this and see how the restoration should be implemented (if necessary), I should retrieve the source code of the `_finalize` method to examine its contents and ensure it contains the logic to restore original log levels. I should also retrieve fields to ensure `_initial_logger_levels` is declared and set up. 

```python
search_method_in_file("src/_pytest/logging.py", "LogCaptureFixture._finalize")
search_code_in_file("src/_pytest/logging.py", "_initial_logger_levels")
```

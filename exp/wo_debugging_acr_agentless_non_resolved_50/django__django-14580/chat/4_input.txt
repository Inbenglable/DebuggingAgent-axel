Now You need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Missing import statement in generated migration (NameError: name 'models' is not defined)
Description
	
I found a bug in Django's latest release: 3.2.4. 
Given the following contents of models.py:
from django.db import models
class MyField(models.TextField):
	pass
class MyBaseModel(models.Model):
	class Meta:
		abstract = True
class MyMixin:
	pass
class MyModel(MyMixin, MyBaseModel):
	name = MyField(primary_key=True)
The makemigrations command will generate the following migration file:
# Generated by Django 3.2.4 on 2021-06-30 19:13
import app.models
from django.db import migrations
class Migration(migrations.Migration):
	initial = True
	dependencies = [
	]
	operations = [
		migrations.CreateModel(
			name='MyModel',
			fields=[
				('name', app.models.MyField(primary_key=True, serialize=False)),
			],
			options={
				'abstract': False,
			},
			bases=(app.models.MyMixin, models.Model),
		),
	]
Which will then fail with the following error:
 File "/home/jj/django_example/app/migrations/0001_initial.py", line 7, in <module>
	class Migration(migrations.Migration):
 File "/home/jj/django_example/app/migrations/0001_initial.py", line 23, in Migration
	bases=(app.models.MyMixin, models.Model),
NameError: name 'models' is not defined
Expected behavior: Django generates a migration file that is valid Python.
Actual behavior: Django generates a migration file that is missing an import statement.
I think this is a bug of the module django.db.migrations.writer, but I'm not sure. I will be happy to assist with debugging.
Thanks for your attention,
Jaap Joris

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue, I need to investigate the source code responsible for generating migration files in Django, specifically focusing on `django.db.migrations.writer`. This is likely where the import handling is missing or not implemented correctly. 

I will first search for the class `MigrationWriter` in the Django codebase as this appears to be where migration file writing logic would reside. 

```python
search_class_in_codebase("MigrationWriter")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_class_in_codebase("MigrationWriter")
RESULT:
#### django/db/migrations/writer.py:MigrationWriter
```python
class MigrationWriter:
    """
    Take a Migration instance and is able to produce the contents
    of the migration file from it.
    """

    def __init__(self, migration, include_header=True):
        ...

    def as_string(self):
        ...

    @property
    def basedir(self):
        ...

    @property
    def filename(self):
        ...

    @property
    def path(self):
        ...

    @classmethod
    def serialize(cls, value):
        ...

    @classmethod
    def register_serializer(cls, type_, serializer):
        ...

    @classmethod
    def unregister_serializer(cls, type_):
        ...
```


==================================================

Your Output:
To resolve this issue, the next step is to explore the `as_string` method within the `MigrationWriter` class in the file `django/db/migrations/writer.py`. This method is likely responsible for creating the migration file content. Once I have the method's source code, I can determine if modifications are needed to handle the missing import for `models`. 

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/writer.py", "MigrationWriter.as_string")
```

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

To determine whether the issue has been resolved, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Issue**: The problem involves adding DISTINCT support for the `Avg` and `Sum` aggregates, which in prior versions of Django ignored the parameter but now throw an exception.

2. **Reproduce Test**: The tests attempt to recreate the issue by calling `aggregate` with a `distinct=True` argument on `Avg`, `Sum`, `Min`, and `Max`.

3. **Original Test Output**: An `AppRegistryNotReady` error occurs, indicating a setup issue within the test configuration, unrelated to the functionality of DISTINCT with aggregates.

4. **Patch Implementation**: The patch introduces an `allow_distinct = True` attribute to the classes `Avg` and `Sum` within `django/db/models/aggregates.py`. This change aims to allow the use of DISTINCT with these aggregates.

5. **Patched Test Output**: Post-patch, the same `AppRegistryNotReady` error persists, indicating the initial test setup issue remains unaddressed. This error needs resolution within the test setup.

**Conclusion**:

The test does not validate the patch since an unrelated setup error prevents execution of the primary test logic. As a result, evaluating whether the DISTINCT support in `Avg` and `Sum` becomes functional post-patch isn't possible.

In summary, while the patch logically aligns with the issue requirements (by allowing DISTINCT for `Avg` and `Sum`), the determination of its effectiveness cannot be validated by the current test outputs. Therefore, based on the reproducibility of the issue and test results:

Issue resolved: `False`

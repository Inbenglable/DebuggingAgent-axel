To resolve the issue with `_check_homomorphism` in the SymPy project, we need to review the implementation of the `_image()` function, as it appears to be the source of the problem. The issue is specifically related to how inverted generators are managed within PermutationGroups.

I will first search for the `_image()` function in the specified file path to analyze its implementation.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py", "_image")
```

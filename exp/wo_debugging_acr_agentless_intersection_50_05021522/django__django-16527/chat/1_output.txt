To address the issue mentioned, I need to review the current implementation of the code that displays the `show_save_as_new` field in the Django admin. Specifically, I need to examine the `django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py` file around line 102 to analyze the conditions used for `show_save_as_new`. This will allow me to adequately verify the logic and implement the suggested modification to include `has_add_permission`.

Therefore, I need to retrieve the surrounding source code to understand the current implementation and make the necessary modification.

```python
search_code_in_file("django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py", "\"show_save_as_new\": not is_popup")
```

### Review of the Patch and Analysis of Test Output

#### Patch Review

The patch updates the regex used in both `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator`. The initial regex used `^` and `$`, and was changed to use `\A` and `\Z`. This change is meant to ensure that trailing newlines are not accepted, as `$` in Python's regex allows trailing newlines.

The patch appears to correctly address the issue described. By changing `^` to `\A` and `$` to `\Z`, the validators more strictly enforce the intended username validation without accepting a trailing newline. This aligns with the recommendation provided in the issue statement.

#### Analysis of Test Output

1. **Original Output:**
   - The test expected an error when a username with a trailing newline is validated.
   - The original output indicates that no error was raised for a username with a trailing newline, confirming the presence of the bug.

2. **Patched Output:**
   - The patched test outputs confirm that an exception was raised (`django.core.exceptions.ValidationError`) when trying to validate a username with a trailing newline.
   - However, the subsequent error (`django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured`) is not inherently related to the username validators but is instead a configuration issue where Django settings have not been properly defined.

Given the patch's task was to rectify the regex allowing a trailing newline, and the patched test demonstrates that an initial validation error occurs as intended, the patch can be deemed successful regarding the bug fix.

### Conclusion

The patch fixes the original issue in the validators by tightening its regex constraints. The encountered `ImproperlyConfigured` exception relates to test environment configuration, not the change implemented by the patch.

**Issue resolved: `True`**

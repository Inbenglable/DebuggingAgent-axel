To determine whether the issue is fixed, let's review both the patch and the test outputs:

### Patch Review

The patch modifies the `get_group_by` method in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` to exclude `Random` expressions during the aggregation operations. By ensuring that expressions containing randomness are not incorrectly influencing the `GROUP BY` clause, the patch aims to address the issue described.

### Test Output Analysis

**Original Output:**
The test fails with a `django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady` error because the apps aren't loaded yet. This error occurs before the patch is even applied, indicating an issue with the Django test setup rather than the Django code itself.

**Patched Output:**
The output after applying the patch is identical to the original output, with the same `AppRegistryNotReady` exception being raised. This suggests that the underlying Django test configuration problem was not addressed by the code patch.

### Conclusion

Both before and after applying the patch, the same configuration error prevents the test from running, which implies that the patch did not fix or even get a chance to address the specific issue. The fundamental problem lies in the test setup, which needs to be corrected to properly evaluate the patch's effectiveness.

Issue resolved: `False`

To determine if the issue is resolved, let's follow these steps:

1. **Review the Patch:**

   The patch introduces an `allow_distinct = True` attribute to the `Avg` and `Sum` classes in `django/db/models/aggregates.py`. This change allows these aggregates to accept a DISTINCT keyword, which is consistent with how DISTINCT support is provided for other aggregates like `Count`.

2. **Analyze Test Output:**

   Both the original and patched outputs show an exception related to Django's application registry not being ready (`django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet.`). This suggests that there may be a problem in the test setup rather than with the distinct feature itself.

3. **Conclusion:**

   Given that the tests don't run correctly due to an application registry issue, and there are no test case outputs showing distinct aggregation support being correctly applied or tested, we cannot conclude that the issue with DISTINCT support is resolved based on the provided output.

Therefore, since the test infrastructure itself appeared flawed and not capable of validating the patch's effectiveness, we cannot verify that the issue is resolved. A properly set up test environment which initializes apps correctly would be required to evaluate the patch.

Issue resolved: `False`

The original issue was that the `ModelChoiceField` in Django did not include the value of the invalid choice in the error message when raising a `ValidationError`. The provided patch intends to fix this by modifying the exception raised to include the invalid choice value in the error message.

### Review of the Patch:
- The patch updates the `ValidationError` raised in `ModelChoiceField` to include the invalid choice value in the message using string interpolation. Specifically, it replaces:
  ```python
  self.error_messages['invalid_choice'], code='invalid_choice'
  ```
  with:
  ```python
  self.error_messages['invalid_choice'] % {'value': value}, code='invalid_choice'
  ```
- This change allows the error message to replace `%(value)s` in the `invalid_choice` message with the actual invalid value.

### Test Output Analysis:
- Both the original and patched outputs show a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'reproducer'`, indicating that the error in setting up the Django environment prevented both the original and patched tests from running the specified test case.
- Due to this environmental setup issue, neither the original nor the patched test output indicates whether the change resolved the issue.

### Conclusion:
Since the error occurs during the setup phase and is unrelated to the code being tested (the patch to the `ModelChoiceField`), we cannot determine from the provided output whether the issue with the actual field's validation error message is resolved.

However, assuming that the Django environment is appropriately set up and the test script can be executed, the logical change in the patch appears to solve the problem described. Therefore, assuming the patch works as intended when the test environment is corrected, we would expect the issue to be resolved.

But given the presented information specifically about test execution (around `ModuleNotFoundError`), the determination must be:
- **Issue resolved: `False`**

This result is purely based on the inability to verify via test execution due to the setup issue, not an assessment of the patch logic itself.

Based on the retrieved information, I've gathered the necessary source code to understand how the `__eq__` method works across various classes. The issue stems from the handling of equality comparison between `Boolean` types and `Float`, specifically with `S.false` and `S(0.0)`. The `Boolean` class inherits from `Basic`, and `Float.__eq__` directly checks if the `other` object is a `Boolean`. 

To address the issue, we'll likely need to modify `Float.__eq__` so that it correctly returns `True` when compared with `S.false`, similar to how it compares with other types. We might also need to ensure that `BooleanAtom` or other `Boolean` comparisons handle `0.0` correctly. 

Considering these aspects, I have all the necessary information to proceed with generating the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

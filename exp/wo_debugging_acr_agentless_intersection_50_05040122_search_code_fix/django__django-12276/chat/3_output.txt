To resolve the issue, we need to implement the `use_required_attribute` method in the `FileInput` class similar to the method that exists in the `ClearableFileInput` class. Since I have already obtained the current implementation of the `ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute` method and the `FileInput` class source code, I have enough information to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

To resolve the issue, I need to review the implementation of the `_check_homomorphism` function. This function is located in the `homomorphisms.py` file within the SymPy library. Additionally, it is important to understand the context of how permutation inverses are handled within this method. Therefore, I will search for the `_check_homomorphism` method to review its current implementation.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py", "_check_homomorphism")
```

### Patch Review

The patch introduces changes to the function `_TR56` within the `sympy/simplify/fu.py` file. The aim is to handle situations where the expression `rv.exp` could be complex, which previously led to invalid comparison operations.

**Key Changes:**
- Added checks for `rv.exp` being an instance of `Expr`, being `is_number`, and specifically being `is_real` before attempting comparisons. This ensures that relational logic is only applied to real numbers, bypassing the operations that would cause exceptions when `rv.exp` is complex.

### Test Output Analysis

**Original Output:**
- The test fails due to missing the definition of `I`, which leads to a `NameError`.

**Patched Output:**
- The output remains unchanged; the test still fails due to a `NameError` from the undefined `I`.

### Conclusion

The patch deals with the logic within `_TR56` regarding complex number comparisons, but the test script has an unrelated issue: `I` is not defined. This implies that the test is unable to execute the code required to truly verify the patch's effectiveness. 

To properly assess whether the patch fixes the issue, `I` needs to be imported correctly in the test script. This could be done by modifying the import statement to include `I`, like so:

```python
from sympy import Symbol, cos, simplify, I
```

Without this change, the `NameError` prevents us from reaching the bug described in the issue, thus obscuring whether the patch resolves the reported problem.

### Issue Resolved

Issue resolved: `False`

The test setup is incorrect due to the missing definition of `I`, preventing the verification of whether the patch addresses the original bug effectively.

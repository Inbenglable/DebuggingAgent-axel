To resolve the issue mentioned, I need to review the source code of the `ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute()` method and the `FileInput` class within which this method might be redeclared. Since the proposal is to move the method within the hierarchy, it may be important to check how these are implemented.

I'll start by examining the `use_required_attribute` method in the specified file (`django/forms/widgets.py`) and any `FileInput` class code relevant to this functionality. 

Let's search for the `use_required_attribute` method and `FileInput` class in the file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute")
search_class_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "FileInput")
```

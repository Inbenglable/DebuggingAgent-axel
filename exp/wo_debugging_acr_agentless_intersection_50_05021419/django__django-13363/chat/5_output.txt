To proceed with generating the patch, I need to review the source code of the `TimeZoneMixin` since it is responsible for the timezone handling which should work together with the `tzinfo` parameter. Additionally, I'll confirm if `get_tzname()` method is part of this mixin. 

I'll search for the `TimeZoneMixin` class and its `get_tzname` method to understand their current implementations and how the timezone information can be integrated correctly.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TimeZoneMixin")
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TimeZoneMixin.get_tzname")
```

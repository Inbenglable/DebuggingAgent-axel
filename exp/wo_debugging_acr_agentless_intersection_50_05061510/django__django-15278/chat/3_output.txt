To resolve the issue, I need to understand how the `SQLiteSchemaEditor` class handles the addition of fields and unique constraints specifically for the SQLite database in Django migrations. The `AddField` operation relies on the schema editor to perform these database changes, so I need to explore the `SQLiteSchemaEditor` class and its methods.

Given that I've already located the `AddField` class, the next step involves examining the specific methods in `SQLiteSchemaEditor` that deal with adding fields, such as the `add_field` method, or any related method that handles unique constraints during field addition.

Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code for the `SQLiteSchemaEditor` class and specifically look for methods that manage field injection and unique constraints.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("SQLiteSchemaEditor")
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py", "SQLiteSchemaEditor.add_field")
```

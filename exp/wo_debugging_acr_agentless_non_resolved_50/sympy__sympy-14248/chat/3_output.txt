To resolve the issue of incorrect printing for expressions involving `MatrixSymbol`, particularly when involving subtraction which should be printed correctly, the main focus is on methods responsible for printing addition and subtraction. These are likely located within the `printing` module for various output formats.

Here's the analysis of each returned `_print_Add` method:

1. **sympy/printing/fcode.py:FCodePrinter._print_Add**  
   This method handles printing complex numbers in Fortran. It is unlikely related to how `MatrixSymbol` differences print in typical formats as it doesn't directly alter subtraction representation for `MatrixSymbol`.

2. **sympy/printing/repr.py:ReprPrinter._print_Add**  
   This method represents the expression as `Add(...)`, which is more related to internal representation than display format, hence not relevant for fixing display issue.

3. **sympy/printing/latex.py:LatexPrinter._print_Add**  
   This method deals with LaTeX representation, specifically formatting expressions with proper plus and minus signs. It is highly relevant since the bug report includes issues with the LaTeX printer.

4. **sympy/printing/llvmjitcode.py:LLVMJitPrinter._print_Add**  
   This method compiles expressions using LLVM JIT compilation, focusing on the numeric operations rather than symbolic display. It's not relevant here.

5. **sympy/printing/glsl.py:GLSLPrinter._print_Add**  
   This method handles expression printing with GLSL, with specific functions for addition and subtraction, possibly useful but not directly related to character printing for symbolic representation.

6. **sympy/printing/mathml.py:MathMLPresentationPrinter._print_Add**  
   This method is for presentation of expressions as MathML, and involves plus and minus sign adjustments. It's potentially useful given that MathML could be used for symbolic web display.

7. **sympy/printing/str.py:StrPrinter._print_Add**  
   This method formats expressions into string representations suitable for typical display to users. It is crucial for resolving the display issue in the bug report.

8. **sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py:PrettyPrinter._print_Add**  
   This method focuses on pretty-printed output for expressions, ensuring correct display of minus signs and other formatting. It's relevant due to the pretty printer's mention in the bug report.

Based on this analysis, these are the contents needed to address the issue:

```
sympy/printing/latex.py:LatexPrinter._print_Add
sympy/printing/str.py:StrPrinter._print_Add
sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py:PrettyPrinter._print_Add
sympy/printing/mathml.py:MathMLPresentationPrinter._print_Add
```

To resolve the issue, I need to review the source code of the `_image` function, as mentioned in the issue, within the `homomorphisms.py` file. This function is likely responsible for checking the homomorphism condition, which involves verifying the images of generators under the permutation group's operations. 

Let's proceed by searching for the `_image` method in the appropriate file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py", "_image")
```

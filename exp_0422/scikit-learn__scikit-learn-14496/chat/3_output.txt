To address Step 1, I'll generate a minimal debugging test based on the reproduction script provided. The purpose of this test is to replicate the issue so that we can debug it in subsequent steps.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.cluster import OPTICS

# Create small sample dataset
data = np.array([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0], [5.0, 6.0]])

# Instantiate OPTICS with a float for min_samples
clust = OPTICS(metric='minkowski', n_jobs=-1, min_samples=0.1)

# Run fit method to trigger the error
clust.fit(data)
```

Here is the code in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
  "debugging_test": "import numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.cluster import OPTICS\n\n# Create small sample dataset\ndata = np.array([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0], [5.0, 6.0]])\n\n# Instantiate OPTICS with a float for min_samples\nclust = OPTICS(metric='minkowski', n_jobs=-1, min_samples=0.1)\n\n# Run fit method to trigger the error\nclust.fit(data)\n"
}
``` 

With this debugging test prepared, you can use it in the next steps to identify and modify the code source that is causing the issue.

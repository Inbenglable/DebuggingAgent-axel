To resolve the issue of making the `element_id` argument optional in the `json_script` function, I need to focus on the implementation details where the `element_id` is being actively used. Let's analyze the API results:

1. **`django/template/defaultfilters.py:json_script`**:
    - This function appears to simply call another function `_json_script` with `value` and `element_id`. This location might be part of a chain of function calls related to `json_script`, but it doesn't directly show how `element_id` is used.

2. **`django/utils/html.py:json_script`**:
    - This is where the `element_id` is actively used in the `format_html` function to create a script tag with an `id`. Here, `element_id` is directly used to construct the HTML script tag.

Based on this analysis, the content from `django/utils/html.py:json_script` is the core implementation where making the `element_id` optional would have a direct effect. This is where changes would be necessary to accommodate an optional `element_id`.

Therefore, the relevant file and function content needed for the resolution are:

```
django/utils/html.py:json_script
```

To resolve the issue with `_check_homomorphism` in the `sympy.combinatorics.homomorphisms` module, I need to first understand how `_image()` is implemented. The issue seems to be related to how inverted generators are handled within this function. Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code for `_image()` to analyze it and make necessary modifications.

I'll proceed with searching for the `_image()` method in the relevant file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py", "_image")
```

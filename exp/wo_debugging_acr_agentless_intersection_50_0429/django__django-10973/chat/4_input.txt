## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Use subprocess.run and PGPASSWORD for client in postgres backend
Description
	
â€‹subprocess.run was added in python 3.5 (which is the minimum version since Django 2.1). This function allows you to pass a custom environment for the subprocess.
Using this in django.db.backends.postgres.client to set PGPASSWORD simplifies the code and makes it more reliable.

</ISSUE>


You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To address the issue regarding the use of `subprocess.run` and `PGPASSWORD` for the client in the PostgreSQL backend, I need to inspect the relevant method in the Django PostgreSQL backend to understand its current implementation. This will guide how the subprocess call should be modified.

The issue mentions modifying the method in `django.db.backends.postgres.client`, so I need to find and inspect the relevant code in that file. Given this, I will search for the method responsible for executing the database client command, which might be the `DatabaseClient` class's methods within this file.

Let's start by searching for this method in the PostgreSQL backend client file.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("DatabaseClient")
```

Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("DatabaseClient")
RESULT:
#### django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py:DatabaseClient
```python
class DatabaseClient(BaseDatabaseClient):
    executable_name = 'psql'

    @classmethod
    def runshell_db(cls, conn_params):
        args = [cls.executable_name]

        host = conn_params.get('host', '')
        port = conn_params.get('port', '')
        dbname = conn_params.get('database', '')
        user = conn_params.get('user', '')
        passwd = conn_params.get('password', '')

        if user:
            args += ['-U', user]
        if host:
            args += ['-h', host]
        if port:
            args += ['-p', str(port)]
        args += [dbname]

        temp_pgpass = None
        sigint_handler = signal.getsignal(signal.SIGINT)
        try:
            if passwd:

                        _escape_pgpass(host) or '*',
                        str(port) or '*',
                        _escape_pgpass(dbname) or '*',
                        _escape_pgpass(user) or '*',
                        _escape_pgpass(passwd),
                        file=temp_pgpass,
                        sep=':',
                        flush=True,
                    )
                    os.environ['PGPASSFILE'] = temp_pgpass.name
                except UnicodeEncodeError:
                    # If the current locale can't encode the data, let the
                    # user input the password manually.
                    pass
            # Allow SIGINT to pass to psql to abort queries.
            signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal.SIG_IGN)
            subprocess.check_call(args)
        finally:
            # Restore the original SIGINT handler.
            signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, sigint_handler)
            if temp_pgpass:
                temp_pgpass.close()
                if 'PGPASSFILE' in os.environ:  # unit tests need cleanup
                    del os.environ['PGPASSFILE']

    def runshell(self):
        DatabaseClient.runshell_db(self.connection.get_connection_params())

```


==================================================

Your Output:
Based on the information retrieved, we have the complete source code of the `DatabaseClient` class, specifically focusing on the `runshell_db` method. This is the method that needs modification to use `subprocess.run` and the `PGPASSWORD` environment variable to simplify and improve the reliability of the code.

I have sufficient information to proceed with generating the patch.

Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

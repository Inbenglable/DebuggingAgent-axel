To address the bug described in the issue, we need to focus on the `kahane_simplify` function and its handling of tensor indices. Observing the output and the relevant code, the `kahane_simplify` function is suspected to incorrectly reorder gamma matrices, particularly when leading indices are not contracted. This reasoning aligns with the issue.

The problematic behavior of reversing the order of leading gamma matrices suggests the manipulations of the list `resulting_indices` or similar constructs involved in matrix operations are incorrect.

Now, focusing on the `kahane_simplify` implementation within this context:

Analyzing the run-time output:

- We observe indices such as `rho` and `sigma` being processed and appended to `resulting_indices` in order `[rho, sigma]` as expected in one instance but reversed in another instance due to mishandling of indices and links.
- The links and iteration logic are crucial here for this matrix arrangement.

Therefore, the method associated with the incorrect reordering is likely within the `kahane_simplify`. The logic handling `resulting_indices` population or its usage needs correction to maintain correct ordering.

To proceed towards resolving this issue or verifying assumptions:

Observed method: `sympy/physics/hep/gamma_matrices.py:kahane_simplify`

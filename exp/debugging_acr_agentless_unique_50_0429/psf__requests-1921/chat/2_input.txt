You need to trace the abnormal program to resolve project issues and submit pull requests.
Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **requests** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Removing a default header of a session
[The docs](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#session-objects) say that you can prevent sending a session header by setting the headers value to None in the method's arguments. You would expect (as [discussed on IRC](https://botbot.me/freenode/python-requests/msg/10788170/)) that this would work for session's default headers, too:

``` python
session = requests.Session()
# Do not send Accept-Encoding
session.headers['Accept-Encoding'] = None
```

What happens is that "None"  gets sent as the value of header.

```
Accept-Encoding: None
```

For the reference, here is a way that works:

``` python
del session.headers['Accept-Encoding']
```


</ISSUE>


Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
import requests

# Create a session
session = requests.Session()

# Try to remove Accept-Encoding header by setting it to None
session.headers['Accept-Encoding'] = None

# Make a request to see what headers are sent
r = session.get('http://httpbin.org/headers')
print(r.json())


This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
To begin resolving this issue, let's first break down what we know from the description and the trace:

### Problem Summary:
- The issue arises when trying to prevent sending a session header (`Accept-Encoding` in this case) by setting it to `None`.
- The expected behavior, according to the documentation, is that setting a header to `None` should prevent it from being sent.
- Instead, `None` is sent as a string value in the header (`Accept-Encoding: None`).
- A test script reproduces this behavior, and a traceback shows that this leads to a `TypeError: expected string or bytes-like object`.

The traceback is particularly helpful in understanding where this error occurs:
- The error surfaces during the HTTP request preparation/sending process. 
- Specifically, it occurs when `http.client.putheader` method is called within the Python standard library, indicating a non-string header value is being handled improperly.

### Analysis and Hypothesis:
- The method `__setitem__` of `CaseInsensitiveDict` is storing the `None` value directly, without handling the conversion or removal of headers set to `None`.
- During the preparation of the HTTP request, these `None` values are likely treated as objects that cannot be encoded or that contradict expected types.

To narrow down the bug further, we should investigate how the session headers are being processed and converted into the final HTTP request. The critical observation will be checking where header values are formatted for sending.

### Next Step:
We should trace how the headers are processed from the session to the HTTP request. This involves looking at how the session headers are utilized at the point of making a request.

Therefore, the next logical step is to observe the method responsible for preparing the request:
- **File:** `requests/sessions.py`
- **Method:** Responsible for request preparation, probably involves `Session.request` or `Session.prepare_request`.

Let's observe the likely candidate:
```plaintext
Observed method: requests/sessions.py:Session.request
```

You need to trace the abnormal program behavior step by step to identify the root cause of the bug and locate the buggy method that contains the code to be fixed.
Now, please first analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior. 

Then, if you can already locate the buggy method and buggy code, reply with:
Buggy method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Otherwise, continue tracing by telling me the code line scope that you want to deeper observe, we will show you the deeper downstream run-time information of the scope you select. Please reply with:
Observed scope: `{FILE_PATH}:{START_LOC}-{END_LOC}`
Note that {FILE_PATH} refers to the path relative to the repository.

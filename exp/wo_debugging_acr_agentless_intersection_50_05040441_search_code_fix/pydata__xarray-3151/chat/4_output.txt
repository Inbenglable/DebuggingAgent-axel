To properly evaluate if the patch resolves the issue, let's review the changes and their effect on the test results:

### Patch Review
The patch modifies the section of the code that checks for monotonicity in the global indexes of concatenated dimensions within `combine_by_coords`. 

- It adds a new piece of logic to first check if the coordinate values of the dimension are consistent across all datasets. Only if the coordinates vary, it goes ahead to check for monotonicity.

This logic aligns with the documented behavior where coordinate dimensions that do not vary should be ignored with respect to monotonicity.

### Test Output Analysis
**Original Output:**
- The test failed due to a `ValueError` being raised when non-monotonic identical coordinates were present.

**Patched Output:**
- The error shifted from a `ValueError` to a `NameError` indicating that the `np` (NumPy) module was not defined when the function attempted to use `np.array_equal`.

### Conclusion
While the patch correctly addresses the logic of skipping monotonicity checks for non-varying coordinates, it introduces a new issue: the `NameError` due to `np` not being imported in the necessary scope. This prevents the patched code from executing as expected.

Thus, as the patch does not successfully address the original issue without introducing a new error, the issue is not fully resolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

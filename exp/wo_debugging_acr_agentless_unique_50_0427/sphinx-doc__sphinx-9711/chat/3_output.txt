To resolve the issue, I will need to find the implementation of the function that checks the version for `needs_extensions`. If it directly compares strings rather than using a version parsing method, then it would need to be changed to properly handle semantic version comparison. I'll start by searching for relevant methods that might handle this functionality within the Sphinx project codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("needs_extensions")
search_method_in_codebase("check_extension_version")
search_code_in_codebase("Sphinx version error:")
```

I need to understand how the version comparison is implemented and the context in which the version error is raised. The searches will help in locating where the fix needs to be applied.

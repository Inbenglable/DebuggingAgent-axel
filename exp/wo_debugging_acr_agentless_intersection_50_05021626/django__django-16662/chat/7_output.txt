To fix the issue, I'll need to modify the part of the code where migration files are written, specifically focusing on the import statement ordering. The `MigrationWriter` class in `django/db/migrations/writer.py` is responsible for generating the contents of the migration file.

I need to retrieve the source code for the `MigrationWriter` class's method that forms the migration file string. This method is likely named something like `as_string`.

I'll proceed to retrieve the source code for this class and its relevant method(s).

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/writer.py", "MigrationWriter.as_string")
search_class_in_file("django/db/migrations/writer.py", "MigrationWriter")
```

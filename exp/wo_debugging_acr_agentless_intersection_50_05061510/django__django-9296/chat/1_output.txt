Based on the issue description, the task is to implement the `__iter__` method in the `Paginator` class. To generate a patch, I need to review the existing `Paginator` class code to understand its structure and see where the new method should be added. 

Since I don't have the file path for the `Paginator` class, I will search the class in the codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Paginator")
```

Based on the provided information, the problematic aspect appears to be within the `MigrationRecorder.record_unapplied` method inside `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`. To create a patch, I need to first review the existing source code for this method to understand how migrations are currently being recorded as unapplied and how squashed migrations are being handled. 

I will proceed to retrieve the source code for the `record_unapplied` method using the relevant search API.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/recorder.py", "MigrationRecorder.record_unapplied")
```

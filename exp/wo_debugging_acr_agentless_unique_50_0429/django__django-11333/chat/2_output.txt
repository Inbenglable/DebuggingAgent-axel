To resolve the issue, it is crucial to analyze how `get_resolver`, `set_urlconf`, and `URLResolver` interact, specifically in the context of caching and re-computation. I have already obtained the source code for the `get_resolver`, `URLResolver`, and `set_urlconf`. To implement the proposed solution, I need to modify the caching behavior of `get_resolver`.

Since we already have the code for the mentioned classes and methods, I am ready to generate the patch:

Ready generation: `True`

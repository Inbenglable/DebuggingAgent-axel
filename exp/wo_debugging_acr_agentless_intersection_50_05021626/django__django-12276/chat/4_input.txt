## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
FileInput shouldn't display required attribute when initial data exists.
Description
	 
		(last modified by thenewguy)
	 
I think that ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute() (â€‹https://github.com/django/django/blob/e703b93a656b78b9b444bb3a9980e305ed002a70/django/forms/widgets.py#L454) should be moved to FileInput.use_required_attribute() so that required is not output on the html input element that represents FileInput when a file is already set (e.g. already saved on a model instance that is being edited).
Maybe I am overlooking a use case where this is not desirable? I can not think of one.

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To address this issue, I need to examine the `use_required_attribute` methods in both `ClearableFileInput` and `FileInput` classes to understand how they currently operate. This will guide the decision of how to move or modify the method according to the issue's requirement.

I'll begin by searching for the `use_required_attribute` method in the `django/forms/widgets.py` file, as it is the file mentioned in the issue for `ClearableFileInput`, and also ensures we find the method in `FileInput`.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute")
search_method_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "FileInput.use_required_attribute")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute")
RESULT:
#### django/forms/widgets.py:ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute
```python
    def use_required_attribute(self, initial):
        return super().use_required_attribute(initial) and not initial

```


### API INVOKE: search_method_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "FileInput.use_required_attribute")
RESULT:
#### django/forms/widgets.py:CheckboxSelectMultiple.use_required_attribute
```python
    def use_required_attribute(self, initial):
        # Don't use the 'required' attribute because browser validation would
        # require all checkboxes to be checked instead of at least one.
        return False

```

#### django/forms/widgets.py:CheckboxSelectMultiple.use_required_attribute
```python
    def use_required_attribute(self, initial):
        # Don't use the 'required' attribute because browser validation would
        # require all checkboxes to be checked instead of at least one.
        return False

```

#### django/forms/widgets.py:CheckboxSelectMultiple.use_required_attribute
```python
    def use_required_attribute(self, initial):
        # Don't use the 'required' attribute because browser validation would
        # require all checkboxes to be checked instead of at least one.
        return False

```

#### django/forms/widgets.py:CheckboxSelectMultiple.use_required_attribute
```python
    def use_required_attribute(self, initial):
        # Don't use the 'required' attribute because browser validation would
        # require all checkboxes to be checked instead of at least one.
        return False

```


==================================================

Your Output:
To effectively address the issue, I need to examine the `FileInput` class in `django/forms/widgets.py` to verify if the `use_required_attribute` method needs to be implemented or adjusted. Although I have found the `ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute` method, I haven't found an implementation for `FileInput`. I will now retrieve the definition of the `FileInput` class, which will help me determine how to integrate the required logic. 

```python
search_class_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "FileInput")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_class_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "FileInput")
RESULT:
#### django/forms/widgets.py:FileInput
```python
class FileInput(Input):
    input_type = 'file'
    needs_multipart_form = True
    template_name = 'django/forms/widgets/file.html'

    def format_value(self, value):
        ...

    def value_from_datadict(self, data, files, name):
        ...

    def value_omitted_from_data(self, data, files, name):
        ...
```


==================================================

Your Output:
I currently have the source code for the `ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute` method. However, the `FileInput` class does not have its own `use_required_attribute` implementation. Given that our goal is to move or modify the logic from `ClearableFileInput` to `FileInput`, I can now generate a patch to add the `use_required_attribute` method in `FileInput`. 

Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

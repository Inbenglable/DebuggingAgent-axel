To address the issue, I first need to examine the current implementation of the `check_constraints` method in the `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py` file. This method is crucial because it contains the SQL statement that requires adjustment to properly quote table names, specifically when they are reserved SQL words. I will retrieve the source code for this method to identify the exact location to make modifications for quoting table names. 

Additionally, I may need to investigate how SQLite table names are typically quoted within Django to ensure consistency with Django's standards.

Let's begin by retrieving the source code of the `check_constraints` method.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py", "check_constraints")
```

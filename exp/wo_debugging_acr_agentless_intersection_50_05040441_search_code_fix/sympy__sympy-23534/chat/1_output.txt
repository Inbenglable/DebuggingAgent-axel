To resolve the issue, we need to check the implementation details of `symbols` function in the SymPy library. This should be responsible for creating instances of `Symbol` or `Function` depending on the input. Let's search for the `symbols` function in the codebase so that we can examine how it handles the `cls` parameter, especially when tuples are provided with extra parentheses.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("symbols")
```

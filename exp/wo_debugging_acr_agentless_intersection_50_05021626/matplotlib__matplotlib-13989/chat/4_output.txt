Based on the retrieved source code of the `hist` method in the `Axes.hist` class located in `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py`, we can identify the problem with the handling of the `range` parameter when `density=True`. 

It appears that the `hist_kwargs` dictionary should correctly pass the `range` parameter to the `np.histogram` function. However, when `density=True`, the range parameter seems not to be properly included in `hist_kwargs`. To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the range parameter is handled regardless of the density setting. 

With this understanding, we are ready to proceed with generating a patch that resolves this issue. 

Ready generation: `True`

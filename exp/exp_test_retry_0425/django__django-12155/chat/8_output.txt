To evaluate whether the issue has been fixed, let's review the patch and examine the test output before and after applying the patch.

### Patch Review

The proposed patch changes the `trim_docstring` function in Django's admin docs utility file as follows:

**Before Patch:**
```python
indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())
```

**After Patch:**
```python
indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())
```

The purpose of this patch is to skip the first line while calculating the minimum indentation for non-empty lines. This aligns with the suggested fix in the issue description.

### Test Output Analysis

**Original Output:**
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-12155/reproduce.py", line 4, in <module>
    from django.contrib.admindocs.views import simplify_exception
ImportError: cannot import name 'simplify_exception'
```

**Patched Output:**
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-12155/reproduce.py", line 4, in <module>
    from django.contrib.admindocs.views import simplify_exception
ImportError: cannot import name 'simplify_exception'
```

The test output remains unchanged before and after applying the patch. The ImportError indicates an external issue unrelated to the `trim_docstring` function's logic. This implies that the test designed to validate the patch's effectiveness did not execute the relevant code due to an import error.

Since the test couldn't verify the patch due to unrelated reasons, we can't determine if the patch itself resolves the issue based solely on the test output provided. However, from a logical perspective, the patch aligns correctly with the described fix for calculating indentation.

**Conclusion:**

Given that the error in the test output isn't related to the `trim_docstring` functionality, and the patch logically addresses the stated issue in `trim_docstring`, it seems that the logical change is appropriate. However, proper verification would require correcting the ImportError and re-running the test to ascertain that the patch fixes the issue.

Issue resolved: `True` (with the caveat that proper verification requires a test that runs successfully without unrelated import errors).

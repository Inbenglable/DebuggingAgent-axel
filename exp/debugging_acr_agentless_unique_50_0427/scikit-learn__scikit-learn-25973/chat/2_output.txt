The issue arises when using an iterable of splits in the `SequentialFeatureSelector` for cross-validation, leading to an `IndexError` in the `_aggregate_score_dicts` method. Given the runtime traceback, it is apparent that the validation step fails, which suggests an issue in handling the cross-validation splits in the `fit` method of `SequentialFeatureSelector`. This likely occurs during the attempt to evaluate feature importances over the cross-validation splits.

Looking at the `SequentialFeatureSelector.fit` method code, my suspicion is that the error may originate from:
- The `self._get_best_new_feature_score` method called within the loop.
- The handling of the generator `splits` and its processing.

However, to further pinpoint the issue, the `_get_best_new_feature_score` method must be inspected as it interfaces directly with cross-validation functions which likely include `_validation.py` functions.

I need to observe deeper downstream behavior specifically around the cross-validation logic.

Observed scope: `sklearn/feature_selection/_sequential.py:277-279`

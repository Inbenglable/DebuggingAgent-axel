To address the issue with the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass not working for properties, I need to examine the implementation details of the `__init__` method in the `InheritDocstrings` class. This will allow me to understand how it is currently handling function objects and where adjustments might need to be made to accommodate properties as well.

To proceed, I will retrieve the source code for the `__init__` method within the `InheritDocstrings` class to determine the necessary modifications.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/utils/misc.py", "InheritDocstrings.__init__")
```

To address the issue, I need to examine the implementation of the hexbin function in Matplotlib. The sections of code handling the `mincnt` parameter when `C` is `None` and when `C` is not `None` have been specified.

I need to retrieve the source code for these sections to better understand how the `mincnt` parameter is being processed and where I can make the necessary changes.

Therefore, I will search for the relevant code sections in the specified file:

```python
search_code_in_file("lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py", "len(vals) >= mincnt")
search_code_in_file("lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py", "len(vals) > mincnt")
```

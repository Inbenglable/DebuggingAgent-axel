I have reviewed the output of the `as_sql` methods for both `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` classes, which currently use `timezone.get_current_timezone_name()`. To resolve the issue, I need to modify these methods to utilize the provided `tzinfo` parameter when it is available. To proceed with generating a patch, I need to retrieve the full source code of the `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` classes to ensure I understand their initialization and how the `tzinfo` parameter is expected to be passed.

Thus, I will proceed to search for the source code of these classes in the `django/db/models/functions/datetime.py` file:

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncDate")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncTime")
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncBase.__init__")
```
This includes inspecting `TruncBase.__init__` if available, since `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` are likely subclassing `TruncBase` and may rely on it for initialization, particularly for handling the `tzinfo` parameter.

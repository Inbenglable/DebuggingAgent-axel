To resolve the issue with the `posify` function not preserving the `is_finite` and other related assumptions, I have obtained the source code of the `posify` function. This code is located in the `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` file. With this information, I am ready to generate a patch to modify this function to preserve additional assumptions.

Ready generation: `True`

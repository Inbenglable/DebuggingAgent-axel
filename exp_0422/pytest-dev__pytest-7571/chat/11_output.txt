To address the issue with `caplog` not restoring the log levels after a test, we need to examine and possibly enhance the `_finalize` method in `LogCaptureFixture`, ensuring it properly reinstates the original log levels for all loggers.

Before generating the patch, I need to retrieve the full source code for the `LogCaptureFixture` class and its `_finalize` method from the file `src/_pytest/logging.py`, so I can analyze how it manages the log level restoration and identify any missing steps or enhancements required.

```python
search_class_in_file("src/_pytest/logging.py", "LogCaptureFixture")
search_method_in_file("src/_pytest/logging.py", "LogCaptureFixture._finalize")
```

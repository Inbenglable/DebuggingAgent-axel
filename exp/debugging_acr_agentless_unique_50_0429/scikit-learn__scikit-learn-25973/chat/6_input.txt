## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Unable to pass splits to SequentialFeatureSelector
### Describe the bug

This runs fine with e.g. `cv=5`, but according to the documentation, it should also be able to take an iterable of splits.
However, passing splits from the cross validator fails

Im fairly certain I have done similar things in the past to other classes in scikit-learn requiring a `cv` parameter.

If somebody could confirm wether this is a bug, or I'm doing something wrong, that would great. Sorry if this is unneeded noise in the feed.

### Steps/Code to Reproduce

```
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.feature_selection import SequentialFeatureSelector
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import LeaveOneGroupOut

import numpy as np

X, y = make_classification()


groups = np.zeros_like(y, dtype=int)
groups[y.size//2:] = 1

cv = LeaveOneGroupOut()
splits = cv.split(X, y, groups=groups)

clf = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)

seq = SequentialFeatureSelector(clf, n_features_to_select=5, scoring='accuracy', cv=splits)
seq.fit(X, y)
```

### Expected Results

Expected to run without errors

</ISSUE>


A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
Observed method: `sklearn/model_selection/_validation.py:cross_validate`
==================================================
The abnormal program behavior occurs because the function `_aggregate_score_dicts` in `sklearn/model_selection/_validation.py` is attempting to access the first element of an empty list, leading to an `IndexError`.

Given the behavior and provided information, the issue appears to stem from how the `SequentialFeatureSelector` class handles the `cv` parameter when it is an iterable of splits. Specifically, it seems that the splitting generator might get exhausted before being utilized properly.

The specific trace steps show that:

1. Splitting occurs normally with a generator.
2. The generator is passed but might be exhausted by the time it is used within the cross-validation process.
3. The `_aggregate_score_dicts` function attempts to aggregate results but finds an empty list, hence the `IndexError`.

To fix this issue, we should make sure that the splits generator is properly materialized so it's not exhausted prematurely.

Now let's locate the actual root cause of this issue. Given the discussed, it's worth looking at how the `SequentialFeatureSelector` is using these splits. Let's start with the `fit` method and observe how it's handling the `cv` splits.

Observed scope: `sklearn/feature_selection/_sequential.py:263-300`
==================================================
To address the cross-validation generator issue, we should investigate how the `cv` parameter is used within `SequentialFeatureSelector`, specifically the `fit` method, which has been observed. The error implicates the `_get_best_new_feature_score` method, which seems to be where the `cross_val_score` is called, and it's likely that `cross_validate` is being invoked.

The initial analysis suggests the generator might be exhausted or improperly handled before the cross-validation. Therefore, we'll need to observe the method where `cross_val_score` is called to ensure it's handled correctly.

Observed method: `sklearn/feature_selection/_sequential.py:SequentialFeatureSelector._get_best_new_feature_score`
==================================================
The issue seems to be related to how the generator object passed as `cv` in `SequentialFeatureSelector` is handled in the `cross_val_score` function. Specifically, the generator might be exhausted, leading to an empty list being returned in the cross-validation results, which then causes an `IndexError` in `_aggregate_score_dicts` when it tries to access a key in an empty list.

The runtime traces show that `_get_best_new_feature_score` calls `cross_val_score` with `cv=self.cv`. The generator passed as `cv` may be consumed after the first feature index is processed, leading to no splits being available for subsequent iterations.

Based on the analysis of `SequentialFeatureSelector._get_best_new_feature_score` and the observed exception, it appears that the handling of `cv` as a generator in this method could be the root cause of the bug.

Therefore, the buggy method is likely located in the observed scope, as the handling of the `cv` generator needs to be addressed in `SequentialFeatureSelector`.

Buggy method: `sklearn/feature_selection/_sequential.py:_get_best_new_feature_score`

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:

Your Output:
Let's retrieve the source code of the `_get_best_new_feature_score` method from the `sklearn/feature_selection/_sequential.py` file to better understand how the `cv` parameter is being handled.

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

Based on the issue description, the problem seems to be related to the `merge` function behavior when `combine_attrs` is set to `'override'`. The incorrect behavior is attributed to incorrect handling of `variable_attrs` in the `merge` function. Specifically, the code snippet suggested for review is:

```python
return variable_attrs[0]
```

Given that the problem is likely related to how `merge` is implemented in the `xarray` library and the suggestion mentions a specific line in the `xarray/core/merge.py` file, I need to retrieve the source code for the `merge` function, especially focusing on the use of `combine_attrs='override'`.

Let's proceed with searching the source code for the `merge` method within the `xarray/core/merge.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("xarray/core/merge.py", "merge")
```

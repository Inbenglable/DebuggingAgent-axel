To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code of the `execute` method from the `ManagementUtility` class in the `django/core/management/__init__.py` file, as this is likely where the `CommandParser` is instantiated and requires modification.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/management/__init__.py", "ManagementUtility.execute")
search_method_in_file("django/core/management/__init__.py", "ManagementUtility.__init__")
```

Based on the provided information and the nature of the issue, we are looking for functionality related to link checking, specifically the handling of HTTP status codes and anchor checking within the Sphinx documentation tool. The search results returned methods named `check` located in test files, `tests/test_domain_c.py` and `tests/test_domain_cpp.py`.

These methods seem to be involved with testing certain features, as they are located in the test files and do not directly indicate functionality related to HTTP link checking. They primarily deal with checking input and managing output as a part of tests, which may not directly correspond to the behavior needed to resolve the issue described (which seems more about runtime link validation and error reporting).

Therefore, these methods are not directly relevant to the issue at hand because they don't offer insight into how Sphinx processes links or handle HTTP status codes.

Since we are interested in the portion of the code responsible for link checking and handling errors related to anchors, we need to look for the implementation logic of link checking in the main codebase rather than in test files. Thus, the search needs to be refined or redirected to the appropriate part of the codebase that deals directly with link checking logic.

To conclude, neither of these results from the TEST files is needed:

To resolve the issue with the `kahane_simplify` function incorrectly reversing the order of leading uncontracted gamma matrices, we need to adjust the logic where leading free gamma matrices are reinserted in the final expression. The mistake is in the loop that currently inserts these matrices backward. Let's create a patch that corrects this logic.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/physics/hep/gamma_matrices.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nfor i in range(0, first_dum_pos):\n    [ri.insert(0, free_pos[i]) for ri in resulting_indices]\n=======\n# Reversing insertion logic to correct the order of free gamma matrices\nfor i in range(first_dum_pos - 1, -1, -1):\n    [ri.insert(0, free_pos[i]) for ri in resulting_indices]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch should correctly restore the intended order of the gamma matrices by iterating in reverse order while inserting the free gamma indices back into the resulting expression.

You need to trace the abnormal program to resolve project issues and submit pull requests.
Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **pytest** project:
#### ISSUE
caplog fixture doesn't restore log level after test
From the documentation at https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.0.0/logging.html#caplog-fixture, "The log levels set are restored automatically at the end of the test".
It used to work, but looks broken in new 6.0 release. Minimal example to reproduce:

```
def test_foo(caplog):
    caplog.set_level(42)

def test_bar(caplog):
    print(caplog.handler.level)
```

It prints "0" for pytest<6, "42" after.


Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
import pytest

@pytest.fixture
def config_logger():
    import logging
    old_level = logging.getLogger().getEffectiveLevel()
    yield
    logging.getLogger().setLevel(old_level)


def test_foo(caplog, config_logger):
    print(f"Initial handler level: {caplog.handler.level}")
    caplog.set_level(42)
    print(f"Handler level after set_level: {caplog.handler.level}")


def test_bar(caplog):
    print(f"Handler level in next test: {caplog.handler.level}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pytest.main([__file__, "-v"])


This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
First, let's analyze the current observed code and abnormal program behavior step-by-step.

1. The issue describes that the `caplog` fixture doesn't restore the log level after the test when using pytest >= 6.0. The expected behavior based on the pytest logging documentation is that the log levels should be restored automatically at the end of the test.

2. We have a minimal example to reproduce the issue:
```python
def test_foo(caplog):
    caplog.set_level(42)

def test_bar(caplog):
    print(caplog.handler.level)
```
In this example, `test_foo` sets the log level to 42 using `caplog.set_level(42)`. In `test_bar`, the expected behavior is that the log level should be reset to its original state, but we observe that the log level is still 42.

3. From the test output, we see:
```
Initial handler level: 0
Handler level after set_level: 42
Handler level in next test: 42
```
This confirms that the log level set by `test_foo` is not being restored after the test.

Now let's delve into the logged trace to locate potentially relevant details:

- The provided trace logs show interactions with the pytest fixture and plugin system, as well as the main test session call. The `FixtureFunctionMarker` indicates the creation of a fixture but does not provide enough detail on caplog's internals.

Given the problem statement, it's clear the issue is related to `caplog`'s handling of log levels between tests. To locate where `caplog` is supposed to reset the log levels, we'll need to observe the methods related to `caplog` fixture handling.

Therefore, the next step is to observe the relevant method in the `caplog` implementation that should handle resetting the log levels. The file associated with `caplog` implementation in pytest is likely inside the `src/_pytest/logging.py`.

Next, we'll observe the probable method within `src/_pytest/logging.py` responsible for resetting log levels.

Observed method: `src/_pytest/logging.py:caplog`
==================================================
Analyzing the current observed code and abnormal program behavior, the `caplog` fixture implementation in `src/_pytest/logging.py` has a method `caplog` which yields a `LogCaptureFixture` instance and calls its `_finalize()` method at the end. This `_finalize()` method is likely related to restoring the log levels. 

To identify the root cause, we need to inspect the `LogCaptureFixture` class and particularly its `_finalize` method to ensure it handles log level restoration correctly.

```python
def caplog(request: FixtureRequest) -> Generator[LogCaptureFixture, None, None]:
    result = LogCaptureFixture(request.node)
    yield result
    result._finalize()
```

Therefore, the next step is to examine the `LogCaptureFixture` implementation and the `_finalize` method therein to check how it is supposed to restore the log levels.

Let's delve into the relevant code in `src/_pytest/logging.py` for `LogCaptureFixture` and `_finalize`.

Observed scope: `src/_pytest/logging.py:353-385`
==================================================
Thanks for the detailed information. Based on the current analysis, the bug occurs because the log levels set during a test are not being restored correctly. We need to ensure that the `LogCaptureFixture._finalize` method, which is responsible for restoring the log levels, is functioning properly. 

To continue tracing and precisely identify the root cause, the next step is to focus on the `_finalize` method. Here's the specific code snippet already observed, which is critical for restoring log levels:

```python
def _finalize(self) -> None:
    """
    This restores the log levels changed by :meth:`set_level`.
    """
    # restore log levels
    for logger_name, level in self._initial_logger_levels.items():
        logger = logging.getLogger(logger_name)
        logger.setLevel(level)
```

So, the next logically observed step is further inspection of how `_initial_logger_levels` is being updated. We need to ensure that `self._initial_logger_levels` is correctly storing the initial log levels before any changes.

### Next Observed Method
Let's move to the initialization part and settings of log levels to trace the abnormal behavior step-by-step:

- Observed method: `LogCaptureFixture.__init__`

This should give us insight into how the initial log levels are being stored, which may confirm if the levels are being tracked properly or identify the specific point of failure.

Once we have this information, we can conclude the root cause and submit the necessary fix.

Observed method: `src/_pytest/logging.py:LogCaptureFixture.__init__`.
==================================================
Based on our ongoing tracing and analysis, we have a good understanding that the `LogCaptureFixture._finalize` method is supposed to restore the log levels but it seems the `_initial_logger_levels` dictionary might not be getting populated as expected at the start of the test.

From the `LogCaptureFixture.__init__` method, we see that `_initial_logger_levels` is an empty dictionary when the fixture is initialized. This dictionary is supposed to store the initial log levels before any changes so that they can be restored later.

The next step to identify the root cause is to check how and when `_initial_logger_levels` is populated with the initial log levels. Given that changing log levels interactively via `caplog.set_level()` is a common scenario, we should inspect how `set_level` method interacts with `_initial_logger_levels`.

Let’s look deeper into the `set_level` method implementation of `LogCaptureFixture` to verify how the initial log levels are recorded.

Observed scope: `src/_pytest/logging.py:400-420`
==================================================
The current analysis has led us to the core issue within the `LogCaptureFixture` class and its interaction with log levels through its `set_level` method. Specifically, we'll need to confirm if the initial log levels are correctly recorded before being altered.

Given that `LogCaptureFixture.__init__` initializes the `_initial_logger_levels` to an empty dictionary, it is crucial to trace the `set_level` method to verify if and how `_initial_logger_levels` gets populated.

Below is our next observed method to ensure we are tracing all interactions with `_initial_logger_levels` effectively:

Observed method: `src/_pytest/logging.py:LogCaptureFixture.set_level`
==================================================
To address the current issue where the `caplog` fixture does not restore the log level after a test, we observed that the `LogCaptureFixture.set_level` method is responsible for setting and saving the initial log levels. 

The code inside the `set_level` method includes:

```python
    422	    def set_level(self, level: Union[int, str], logger: Optional[str] = None) -> None:
    423	        """Sets the level for capturing of logs. The level will be restored to its previous value at the end of
    424	        the test.
    425	
    426	        :param int level: the logger to level.
    427	        :param str logger: the logger to update the level. If not given, the root logger level is updated.
    428	
    429	        .. versionchanged:: 3.4
    430	            The levels of the loggers changed by this function will be restored to their initial values at the
    431	            end of the test.
    432	        """
    433	        logger_obj = logging.getLogger(logger)
    434	        # save the original log-level to restore it during teardown
    435	        self._initial_logger_levels.setdefault(logger, logger_obj.level)
    436	        logger_obj.setLevel(level)
    437	        self.handler.setLevel(level)
```

### Analysis
The key line for restoring the log levels is:

```python
self._initial_logger_levels.setdefault(logger, logger_obj.level)
```

This line should ensure that the initial log level of the specified logger is stored if it is not already present in the `_initial_logger_levels` dictionary. The saved levels would then be used to restore the log levels in the `_finalize` method.

Since `caplog.handler.level` is `42` when it should be reset by `test_bar`, it suggests that either:
1. `_initial_logger_levels` is not being populated correctly, or
2. `_finalize` is not being invoked properly.

### Suspected Cause: 
The code in the set_level method seems to be syntactically correct, but there might be an issue with how `_initial_logger_levels` is being managed or a missing call in another method.

### Further Tracing: 
Given the analysis, let’s ensure that `_initial_logger_levels` is correctly updated upon method invocation and that `_finalize` is invoked correctly by tracing `_initial_logger_levels` through other scopes.

### Next Step:
Observe the tracking and storage of initial log levels across methods affecting `_initial_logger_levels`.

Observed scope: `src/_pytest/logging.py:320-353`

This observation helps trace how `_initial_logger_levels` is populated during fixture initialization and method calls, identifying any broken link or incomplete update, ensuring they support the `set_level` observations accurately.

Let's take a closer look at the aforementioned lines to confirm this theory or explore further: 

```python
src/_pytest/logging.py: 320-353

Hence, we can identify any potential issue in handling or invocation leading to abnormal log level behavior.

   346	        self._item = item
   347	        # dict of log name -> log level
   348	        self._initial_logger_levels = {}  # type: Dict[Optional[str], int]
   349	
   350	    def _finalize(self) -> None:
   351	        """Finalizes the fixture.
   352	
   353	        This restores the log levels changed by :meth:`set_level`.

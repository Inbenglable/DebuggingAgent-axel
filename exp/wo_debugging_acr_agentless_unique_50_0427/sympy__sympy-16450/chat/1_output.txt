To resolve the issue related to the `posify` function, I need to locate and analyze its source code to modify it to preserve finiteness and potentially other assumptions. Since the issue description does not specify the file path for `posify`, I will need to search for the method in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("posify")
```

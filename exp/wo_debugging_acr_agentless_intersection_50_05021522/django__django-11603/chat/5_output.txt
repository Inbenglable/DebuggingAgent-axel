To address the issue of adding DISTINCT support for Avg, Sum, Min, and Max aggregates, I'll set the `allow_distinct` attribute to `True` for these aggregate classes. This will enable the DISTINCT functionality using the existing framework in the `Aggregate` base class.

Here's the patch in `SEARCH/REPLACE` format for the necessary changes:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):\n=======\nclass Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):\n=======\nclass Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Min(Aggregate):\n=======\nclass Min(Aggregate):\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Max(Aggregate):\n=======\nclass Max(Aggregate):\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

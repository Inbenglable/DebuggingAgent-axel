The runtime information reveals issues occurring during argument parsing, indicating that the short `-v` verbose option is expecting an argument, which is not intended behavior. The analysis so far suggests the issue is due to improper setup of this option requiring an argument, which might be defined in argument manager methods responsible for configuring these options.

Previously, the `reset_parsers` method was observed, initializing the `cmdline_parser` but not providing sufficient insight into the exact configuration of `-v`. The actual configuration and registration of options seem to occur deeper in the configuration methods or another related function responsible for setting these options.

Given this, tracing should move to the point where individual command-line options, like `-v` for verbose, are directly set up or registered. The focus should be on parts of the `ArgumentsManager` where these options might be added incorrectly.

Therefore, I will continue examining the `ArgumentsManager` class to find where its options, specifically the `verbose` option, are registered with the parser.

Let's look at how arguments are added or managed, particularly focusing on the methods that deal with option registrations or definitions.

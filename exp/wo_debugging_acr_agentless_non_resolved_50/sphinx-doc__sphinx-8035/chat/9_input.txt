## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Support defining specific `:private-members:` for autodoc
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Currently, if I'm using autodoc, the `:private-members:` option does not allow specification of which private members to document. The current behavior is to document all private members, but what if I would only like to document 1 or 2?

**Describe the solution you'd like**
For `:private-members:` to take arguments, similarly to how `:members:` currently works

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
The current best way to do this is to explicitly list each class in a module and use `:autoattribute:`

==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue of allowing specific private members to be documented using the `:private-members:` option in autodoc, I need to identify where this behavior is defined and modified in the Sphinx codebase. Typically, this would involve modifications in the autodoc module where member filtering occurs. I will start by searching for the existing functionality related to private members in autodoc to understand how they are currently handled.

I will proceed with searching the codebase, focusing on autodoc's implementation that deals with member filtering.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("filter_members")
search_method_in_codebase("get_private_members")
search_code_in_codebase(":private-members:")
```

        - they are undocumented (except if the undoc-members option is set)

==================================================

Your Output:
To implement the requested functionality, we need to modify the behavior of the `filter_members` method in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`. This involves adjusting how private members are processed to allow specifying individual private members, similar to the existing `:members:` option.

From the provided code, it appears the `filter_members` method is responsible for deciding which members should be included based on the options specified.

For the patch, the steps are:
1. Extend the logic in `filter_members` to handle specific private member names, similar to how it checks against `self.options.members`.
2. Update the configuration options to distinguish between including all private members and including specific private members.
3. Ensure this new behavior is correctly documented and follows existing patterns in the code for specific member handling.

Since I already have the code for `filter_members`, I'm ready to implement the patch.

Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json

  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",

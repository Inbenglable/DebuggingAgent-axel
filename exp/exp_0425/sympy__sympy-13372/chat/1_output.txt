Analyzing the observed code and abnormal program behavior: The issue involves an `UnboundLocalError` being raised when evaluating a symbolic expression using `evalf`. The error arises because the variables `reprec` and `imprec` are referenced before assignment during the call to `evalf`.

The problem is within the `evalf` function, specifically related to handling when a function is not correctly mapped within `evalf_table`.

Based on the trace, the error occurs when handling `Max` within multiplication, which does not have a corresponding entry in `evalf_table`. An attempt to evaluate using fallback logic results in a missing assignment for `reprec` and `imprec`.

Given the traceback, the next step is to examine the handling of these variables within `evalf.py`.

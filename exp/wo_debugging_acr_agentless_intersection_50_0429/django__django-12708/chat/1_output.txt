To address this issue, I need to examine the `_delete_composed_index` method located in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`. This method is crucial because the error described occurs here, and analyzing its implementation will help me understand the problem better and guide the generation of a patch.

Additionally, I may need to check the related migration handling methods and classes or any unique/index handling in the Django migrations framework to see where adjustments might be needed, particularly in relation to `unique_together` and `index_together`.

Therefore, I will start by retrieving the source code for the `_delete_composed_index` method.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "_delete_composed_index")
```

Here is the patch to resolve the issue mentioned in the `add_fields` method, ensuring it handles cases where `index` is `None`:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/forms/formsets.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or index < initial_form_count):\n=======\n        if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or (index is not None and index < initial_form_count)):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
``` 

The patch modifies the condition to check if `index` is not `None` before comparing it with `initial_form_count`.

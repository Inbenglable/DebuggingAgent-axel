Based on the test script and output provided, the issue is with the `submit_row` function in the `django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py` file. The problem is that the "Save as new" option is shown even without the "add" permission, which is confirmed by the test output stating "FAIL: 'Save as new' is shown even without add permission".

The logic related to the `show_save_as_new` context variable is closely tied to the conditions in the `submit_row` function. It currently only checks if the context is not a popup, if the user has change permission, if `change` is true, and if `save_as` is true. The report suggests adding an additional condition to also check for `has_add_permission`.

Given this, we can deduce that the potential buggy logic is within the `submit_row` function where these variables and conditions are constructed and evaluated.

Thus, the buggy method is identified as:

**Buggy method:** `django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py:submit_row`

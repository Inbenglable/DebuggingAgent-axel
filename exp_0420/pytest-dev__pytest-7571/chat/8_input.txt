You need to trace the abnormal program to resolve project issues and submit pull requests.
Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **pytest** project:
#### ISSUE
caplog fixture doesn't restore log level after test
From the documentation at https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.0.0/logging.html#caplog-fixture, "The log levels set are restored automatically at the end of the test".
It used to work, but looks broken in new 6.0 release. Minimal example to reproduce:

```
def test_foo(caplog):
    caplog.set_level(42)

def test_bar(caplog):
    print(caplog.handler.level)
```

It prints "0" for pytest<6, "42" after.


Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
import pytest
import logging

def test_foo(caplog):
    print(f"Initial handler level in test_foo: {caplog.handler.level}")
    caplog.set_level(42)
    print(f"Handler level after set_level in test_foo: {caplog.handler.level}")

def test_bar(caplog):
    print(f"Initial handler level in test_bar: {caplog.handler.level}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pytest.main([__file__, "-v"])



This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
Based on the provided test and its output, the issue lies within the `caplog` fixture of the `pytest` library where it doesn't restore the log level after the test runs.

Let's delve into the `caplog` fixture implementation to identify where the log level restoration should occur. The `caplog` fixture is often found in logging-related modules of pytest.

A typical place to start is in the logging plugin of pytest, so let's observe the configuration of the plugin.

Observed method: `src/_pytest/logging.py:LoggingPlugin.__init__`
==================================================
### Analysis of Current Observed Code and Behavior:
The issue seems to be with the `caplog` fixture where it doesn't restore log levels after the test has run.

Observing `LoggingPlugin.__init__`, we notice that various logging handlers are set up but there are no clear indications that this initialization method is directly responsible for resetting log levels of the `caplog` fixture.

From the test given, we see that `caplog.set_level(42)` sets the log level of `caplog.handler`. However, the next test shows that the log level remains set to `42` indicating it wasn't reset after the first test.

To dig deeper, it’s crucial to trace beyond the initialization of `LoggingPlugin`. Specifically, we should focus on where the `caplog` fixture resides and how `caplog.set_level()` and log level restoration operates within the fixture’s lifecycle.

## Next Steps:
To effectively trace to the root cause, we need to examine the implementation details behind `caplog` behaviors. 
We should locate where `caplog` is implemented and manage its state before and after tests.

### Hypothesis:
The `caplog` fixture might be missing a teardown or reset mechanism for log levels after the test execution finishes.

### Plan:
1. Locate the `caplog` fixture definition and investigate methods related to setting and resetting log levels.
2. Assess the teardown or state-resetting mechanisms to ensure cleanup or reset logic restores the state correctly.

### Scope to Observe:
To continue tracing, observe the `caplog` fixture specifically around the method extending its functionality during test setup and teardown.

**Observed scope**: `src/_pytest/logging.py:600-650`

Let’s go ahead and trace this scope to find relevant methods or classes implementing the `caplog` fixture.
==================================================
Based on the current analysis, we can infer that the issue likely relates to the `caplog` fixture's lifecycle management of logging levels. The initialization methods and hook implementations in `LoggingPlugin` provide a clear setup and entry points for configuring log levels and capturing logs during session start, collection, and runtest loop.

However, the observed behavior indicates that the teardown logic to restore log levels might be missing or not functioning correctly within the `caplog` fixture mechanism. The `caplog` fixture should ideally contain code that resets log levels to their original state after each test.

To dive further, we should trace the `caplog` fixture definition and examine any related methods that handle setting and restoring log levels during test setup and teardown.

### Next Method to Observe:
Since we are looking for lifecycle management related to the `caplog` fixture, the logical next step involves checking where the `caplog` fixture is implemented and managed. We should look closely within `_pytest/logging.py` as the `caplog` fixture resides there.

The `caplog` fixture is often defined with lifecycle management methods such as `__enter__` and `__exit__`, and potentially a `teardown` method.

### Plan:
1. Locate the `caplog` fixture within `_pytest/logging.py`.
2. Examine methods related to setting and restoring log levels during test execution.

#### Observed method:
`src/_pytest/logging.py:LoggingPlugin.caplog`

Let’s proceed by observing the implementation around the `caplog` fixture for further clarity on lifecycle management.
==================================================


Now you choose downstream method caplog to further observe, tracing the abnormal program behavior.
This is the method code:
   462	def caplog(request: FixtureRequest) -> Generator[LogCaptureFixture, None, None]:
   463	    """Access and control log capturing.
   464	
   465	    Captured logs are available through the following properties/methods::
   466	
   467	    * caplog.messages        -> list of format-interpolated log messages
   468	    * caplog.text            -> string containing formatted log output
   469	    * caplog.records         -> list of logging.LogRecord instances
   470	    * caplog.record_tuples   -> list of (logger_name, level, message) tuples
   471	    * caplog.clear()         -> clear captured records and formatted log output string
   472	    """
   473	    result = LogCaptureFixture(request.node)
   474	    yield result
   475	    result._finalize()


This is the runtime information of caplog:

You need to trace the abnormal program behavior step by step to identify the root cause of the bug and locate the buggy method that contains the code to be fixed.
Now, please first analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior. 

Then, if you can already locate the buggy method and buggy code, reply with:  
Buggy method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Otherwise, continue tracing by telling me the code line scope that you want to deeper observe, we will show you the deeper downstream run-time information of the scope you select. Please reply with:
Observed scope: `{FILE_PATH}:{START_LOC}-{END_LOC}`
Note that {FILE_PATH} refers to the path relative to the repository.

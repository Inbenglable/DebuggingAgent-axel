Based on the information gathered, the `mul_symbol` functionality is embedded within the `LatexPrinter` class in the file `sympy/printing/latex.py`. To accommodate an arbitrary multiplication symbol as described in the issue, adjustments will need to be made to this class, likely affecting methods that handle the printing of multiplication expressions, such as `_print_Mul`.

To proceed with generating a patch, I need to retrieve the implementation details for the `_print_Mul` method within the `LatexPrinter` class to see precisely how the `mul_symbol` is currently being handled. Therefore, I'll search for this method specifically in the `sympy/printing/latex.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/latex.py", "LatexPrinter._print_Mul")
```

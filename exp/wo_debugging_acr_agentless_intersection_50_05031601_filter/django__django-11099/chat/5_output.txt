To resolve the issue where trailing newlines are allowed in usernames by the `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator`, we'll modify the regular expression patterns in both classes. We'll replace `^` and `$` with `\A` and `\Z`, respectively, to ensure the usernames do not end with a newline.

Here is the search/replace patch format to apply the changes:

```python
### django/contrib/auth/validators.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    regex = r'^[\w.@+-]+$'
=======
    regex = r'\A[\w.@+-]+\Z'
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, I'll provide the edit result in JSON format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/auth/validators.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    regex = r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'\n=======\n    regex = r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

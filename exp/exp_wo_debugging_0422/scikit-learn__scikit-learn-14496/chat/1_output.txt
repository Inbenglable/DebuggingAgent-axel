To resolve this issue, I need to analyze the computations happening around the instantiation of the NearestNeighbours class in the OPTICS implementation. Specifically, I need to locate the lines in the `optics_.py` file referenced in the issue, to verify and modify the handling of `min_samples`. This is necessary to ensure it is converted to an integer if it is initially given as a float.

I will search for those contextually relevant lines of code within the `optics_.py` file and specifically check the usage of `min_samples`.

```python
search_code_in_file("sklearn/cluster/optics_.py", "min_samples = max(2, min_samples * n_samples)")
```

The test output both before and after the patch indicates the same error: `django.db.utils.OperationalError: no such table: __main___timeslots`. This error suggests that the table for the `TimeSlots` model was not created successfully, which prevents the test from running correctly.

The problem doesn't seem to be related to the specific logic in the `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` functions but rather an issue with the database setup within the test. The traces indicate failure at the point of trying to create test entries in the database, which stops the test from reaching the code where the patch is supposed to address the timezone issue.

Since the test didn't actually run the logic that was patched, the test output cannot confirm whether the patch resolved the issue with the timezone handling in `TruncDate` and `TruncTime`. The patch itself modifies the `as_sql` method to consider `self.tzinfo`, which aligns with the requirements described in the issue. However, confirmation of issue resolution requires the test setup error to be fixed to proceed with valid testing.

Hence, based on the current state of the test output:

Issue resolved: `False`

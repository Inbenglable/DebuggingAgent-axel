To generate the patch for implementing the `__iter__` method in the `Paginator` class, I need to ensure I have the complete context of the `Paginator` class, especially the `page_range` and `page` methods, as these will be directly involved in the new implementation. The search results so far have not provided full method implementations, so I need to gather this information.

Therefore, I will use the search APIs to retrieve the source code for the `page_range` property and the `page` method from the `Paginator` class within the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/paginator.py", "Paginator.page_range")
search_method_in_file("django/core/paginator.py", "Paginator.page")
```

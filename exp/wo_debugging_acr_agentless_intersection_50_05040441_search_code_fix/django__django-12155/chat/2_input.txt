## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
docutils reports an error rendering view docstring when the first line is not empty
Description
	
Currently admindoc works correctly only with docstrings where the first line is empty, and all Django docstrings are formatted in this way.
However usually the docstring text starts at the first line, e.g.:
def test():
	"""test tests something.
	"""
and this cause an error:
Error in "default-role" directive:
no content permitted.
.. default-role:: cmsreference
The culprit is this code in trim_docstring:
indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())
The problem is that the indentation of the first line is 0.
The solution is to skip the first line:
indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())
Thanks.

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To address the issue, I need to locate and inspect the `trim_docstring` function to understand its current implementation. This will allow me to make the necessary modification to skip the first line when calculating indentation.

Since the issue description doesn't specify the file where `trim_docstring` is defined, I will search for this method in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("trim_docstring")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("trim_docstring")
RESULT:
#### django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py:trim_docstring
```python
def trim_docstring(docstring):
    """
    Uniformly trim leading/trailing whitespace from docstrings.

    Based on https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/#handling-docstring-indentation
    """
    if not docstring or not docstring.strip():
        return ''
    # Convert tabs to spaces and split into lines
    lines = docstring.expandtabs().splitlines()
    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())
    trimmed = [lines[0].lstrip()] + [line[indent:].rstrip() for line in lines[1:]]
    return "\n".join(trimmed).strip()

```


==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

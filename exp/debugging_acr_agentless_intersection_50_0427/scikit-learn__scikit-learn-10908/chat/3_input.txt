CountVectorizer's get_feature_names raise not NotFittedError when the vocabulary parameter is provided
If you initialize a `CounterVectorizer` and try to perform a transformation without training you will get a `NotFittedError` exception.

```python
In [1]: from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
In [2]: vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
In [3]: corpus = [
    ...:     'This is the first document.',
    ...:     'This is the second second document.',
    ...:     'And the third one.',
    ...:     'Is this the first document?',
    ...: ]

In [4]: vectorizer.transform(corpus)
NotFittedError: CountVectorizer - Vocabulary wasn't fitted.
```
On the other hand if you provide the `vocabulary` at the initialization of the vectorizer you could transform a corpus without a prior training, right?

```python
In [1]: from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

In [2]: vectorizer = CountVectorizer()

In [3]: corpus = [
    ...:     'This is the first document.',
    ...:     'This is the second second document.',
    ...:     'And the third one.',
    ...:     'Is this the first document?',
    ...: ]

In [4]: vocabulary = ['and', 'document', 'first', 'is', 'one', 'second', 'the', 'third', 'this']

In [5]: vectorizer = CountVectorizer(vocabulary=vocabulary)

In [6]: hasattr(vectorizer, "vocabulary_")
Out[6]: False

In [7]: vectorizer.get_feature_names()
NotFittedError: CountVectorizer - Vocabulary wasn't fitted.

In [8]: vectorizer.transform(corpus)
Out[8]:
<4x9 sparse matrix of type '<class 'numpy.int64'>'
        with 19 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Row format>

In [9]: hasattr(vectorizer, "vocabulary_")
Out[9]: True
```

The `CountVectorizer`'s `transform` calls `_validate_vocabulary` method which sets the `vocabulary_` instance variable.

In the same manner I believe that the `get_feature_names` method should not raise `NotFittedError` if the vocabulary parameter is provided but the vectorizer has not been trained.

        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "get_feature_names() raised an exception when it should not have"

    main()


This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
To trace the abnormal behavior, let's begin by analyzing the stack trace. The error involves the `get_feature_names()` method returning a `NotFittedError` due to the vocabulary not being fitted. 

Importantly, the expectation is that when a `vocabulary` parameter is provided during the initialization of `CountVectorizer`, the vectorizer should not need to be fitted to provide feature names. The issue arises because `get_feature_names()` internally calls `_check_vocabulary()`, which checks if `self.vocabulary_` is set. However, when `vocabulary` is directly provided, `self.vocabulary_` is not initially set; it's only set upon transformation (via `transform` method), but `get_feature_names()` is expected to work without this step in this particular use case.

Therefore, a deeper understanding of how the `vocabulary_` attribute is set when `vocabulary` is provided is needed, as well as how the `_check_vocabulary()` function influences this process.

Next, we'll trace the call to `_check_vocabulary()` inside `get_feature_names()` to understand its operation and discern where the incorrect `NotFittedError` is raised.

Observed method: `sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py:_check_vocabulary`
==================================================
The problem arises from the `CountVectorizer` class not correctly setting the `vocabulary_` attribute when a `vocabulary` parameter is provided at initialization. This causes the `check_is_fitted` function in `VectorizerMixin._check_vocabulary` to incorrectly raise a `NotFittedError`. 

The stack trace shows that the `NotFittedError` is triggered because `check_is_fitted(self, 'vocabulary_', msg=msg)` is executed at line 304 in `VectorizerMixin._check_vocabulary`, but the `vocabulary_` attribute has not been set, even though a vocabulary was provided during initialization.

The `vocabulary_` should be set during initialization when a vocabulary is directly provided. The bug lies in the fact that this initialization step isn't being appropriately handled.

From the trace, we can hypothesize that `_validate_vocabulary()` may not be managing the initialization of `self.vocabulary_` correctly when a custom vocabulary is provided. Given the context, this method might not be called or function properly during initialization to set the `vocabulary_`.

Thus, we should investigate the initialization of `CountVectorizer`, specifically how it handles the `vocabulary` parameter. 

Since the problem is likely in how `vocabulary_` is set during initialization, let's trace through the initialization of `CountVectorizer` to confirm our hypothesis.

Observed scope: `sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py:846-871`

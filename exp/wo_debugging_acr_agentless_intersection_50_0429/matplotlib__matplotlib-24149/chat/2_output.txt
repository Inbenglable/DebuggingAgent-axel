The issue arises from how the `ax.bar` method handles NaN values, particularly when converting the `x` values using the `_convert_dx` and `_safe_first_finite` methods. The code review of these methods shows that `_safe_first_finite` uses a generator expression to retrieve the first finite value, but it throws a `StopIteration` exception when no finite values are present. To fix this, a check ensuring at least one finite value exists in the input before processing could be helpful. Since I've reviewed the relevant code parts, I have enough information to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

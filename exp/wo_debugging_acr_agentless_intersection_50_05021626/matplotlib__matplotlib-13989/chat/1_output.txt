Given the information from the issue, we need to locate the `hist` method and examine how it handles the `range` parameter when `density=True`. 

To address the issue, we'll start by locating and inspecting the source code for the `hist` method in the Matplotlib codebase. Since I don't have the file path for this method, I'll search for it across the entire codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("hist")
```

To resolve the issue, I need to determine where Sphinx is handling version comparisons for extensions. The `setup_extension` method itself does not directly handle any version-related checks, it just loads extensions via a registry. To locate the code responsible for version comparisons, I need to further explore the project. I'll search for methods related to `extension`, `version`, or `needs_extensions` within the Sphinx project (since the issue is apparently related to version checking within Sphinx). Let's start by searching for a method that seems closely related to checking extensions' versions.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("needs_extensions")
```

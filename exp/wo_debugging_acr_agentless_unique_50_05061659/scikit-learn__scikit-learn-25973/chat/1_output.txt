To resolve the issue, I need to look into how the `SequentialFeatureSelector` class processes the `cv` parameter and handles the iterable of splits. Specifically, I should look into the `sequential_feature_selector` method and the class implementation within the scikit-learn codebase.

Therefore, I will retrieve the source code of the `SequentialFeatureSelector` class and its relevant methods to identify where the patch can be applied.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("SequentialFeatureSelector")
search_method_in_codebase("SequentialFeatureSelector.fit")
```

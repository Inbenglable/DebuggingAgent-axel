Expose warm_start in Isolation forest
It seems to me that `sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest` supports incremental addition of new trees with the `warm_start` parameter of its parent class, `sklearn.ensemble.BaseBagging`.

Even though this parameter is not exposed in `__init__()` , it gets inherited from `BaseBagging` and one can use it by changing it to `True` after initialization. To make it work, you have to also increment `n_estimators` on every iteration. 

It took me a while to notice that it actually works, and I had to inspect the source code of both `IsolationForest` and `BaseBagging`. Also, it looks to me that the behavior is in-line with `sklearn.ensemble.BaseForest` that is behind e.g. `sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`.

To make it more easier to use, I'd suggest to:
* expose `warm_start` in `IsolationForest.__init__()`, default `False`;
* document it in the same way as it is documented for `RandomForestClassifier`, i.e. say:
```py
    warm_start : bool, optional (default=False)
        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit
        and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole
        new forest. See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.
```
* add a test to make sure it works properly;
* possibly also mention in the "IsolationForest example" documentation entry;

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To address the issue of exposing `warm_start` in the `IsolationForest` class, I need to retrieve the source code for `IsolationForest` and potentially the methods associated with its initialization and fitting processes to confirm where the `warm_start` parameter can be added and how the documentation and test can be adjusted appropriately.

I'll search for the `IsolationForest` class and its `__init__` method in the codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("IsolationForest")
search_method_in_codebase("IsolationForest.__init__")
```

RESULT:
#### sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py:IsolationForest
```python
class IsolationForest(BaseBagging, OutlierMixin):
    """Isolation Forest Algorithm

    Return the anomaly score of each sample using the IsolationForest algorithm

    The IsolationForest 'isolates' observations by randomly selecting a feature
    and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum
    values of the selected feature.

    Since recursive partitioning can be represented by a tree structure, the
    number of splittings required to isolate a sample is equivalent to the path
    length from the root node to the terminating node.

    This path length, averaged over a forest of such random trees, is a
    measure of normality and our decision function.

    Random partitioning produces noticeably shorter paths for anomalies.
    Hence, when a forest of random trees collectively produce shorter path
    lengths for particular samples, they are highly likely to be anomalies.

    .. versionadded:: 0.18

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_estimators : int, optional (default=100)
        The number of base estimators in the ensemble.

    max_samples : int or float, optional (default="auto")
        The number of samples to draw from X to train each base estimator.
            - If int, then draw `max_samples` samples.
            - If float, then draw `max_samples * X.shape[0]` samples.
            - If "auto", then `max_samples=min(256, n_samples)`.

        If max_samples is larger than the number of samples provided,
        all samples will be used for all trees (no sampling).

    contamination : float in (0., 0.5), optional (default=0.1)
        The amount of contamination of the data set, i.e. the proportion
        of outliers in the data set. Used when fitting to define the threshold
        on the decision function. If 'auto', the decision function threshold is
        determined as in the original paper.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.20
           The default value of ``contamination`` will change from 0.1 in 0.20
           to ``'auto'`` in 0.22.

    max_features : int or float, optional (default=1.0)
        The number of features to draw from X to train each base estimator.

            - If int, then draw `max_features` features.
            - If float, then draw `max_features * X.shape[1]` features.

    bootstrap : boolean, optional (default=False)
        If True, individual trees are fit on random subsets of the training
        data sampled with replacement. If False, sampling without replacement
        is performed.

    n_jobs : int or None, optional (default=None)
        The number of jobs to run in parallel for both `fit` and `predict`.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    behaviour : str, default='old'
        Behaviour of the ``decision_function`` which can be either 'old' or
        'new'. Passing ``behaviour='new'`` makes the ``decision_function``
        change to match other anomaly detection algorithm API which will be
        the default behaviour in the future. As explained in details in the
        ``offset_`` attribute documentation, the ``decision_function`` becomes
        dependent on the contamination parameter, in such a way that 0 becomes
        its natural threshold to detect outliers.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20
           ``behaviour`` is added in 0.20 for back-compatibility purpose.

        .. deprecated:: 0.20
           ``behaviour='old'`` is deprecated in 0.20 and will not be possible
           in 0.22.

        .. deprecated:: 0.22
           ``behaviour`` parameter will be deprecated in 0.22 and removed in
           0.24.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default=None)
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`.

    verbose : int, optional (default=0)
        Controls the verbosity of the tree building process.


    Attributes
    ----------
    estimators_ : list of DecisionTreeClassifier
        The collection of fitted sub-estimators.

    estimators_samples_ : list of arrays
        The subset of drawn samples (i.e., the in-bag samples) for each base
        estimator.

    max_samples_ : integer
        The actual number of samples

    offset_ : float
        Offset used to define the decision function from the raw scores.
        We have the relation: ``decision_function = score_samples - offset_``.
        Assuming behaviour == 'new', ``offset_`` is defined as follows.
        When the contamination parameter is set to "auto", the offset is equal
        to -0.5 as the scores of inliers are close to 0 and the scores of
        outliers are close to -1. When a contamination parameter different
        than "auto" is provided, the offset is defined in such a way we obtain
        the expected number of outliers (samples with decision function < 0)
        in training.
        Assuming the behaviour parameter is set to 'old', we always have
        ``offset_ = -0.5``, making the decision function independent from the
        contamination parameter.

    Notes
    -----
    The implementation is based on an ensemble of ExtraTreeRegressor. The
    maximum depth of each tree is set to ``ceil(log_2(n))`` where
    :math:`n` is the number of samples used to build the tree
    (see (Liu et al., 2008) for more details).

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

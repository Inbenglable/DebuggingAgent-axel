To resolve the issue described, I need to examine the code related to the argument parsing for the `verbose` option. Typically, this code would be part of a script or file where the command-line interface for Pylint is defined. I will start by searching for methods related to argument parsing or option setting within the Pylint project codebase.

Since I don't have the specific file path of the method dealing with command-line options, I will search for relevant methods in the codebase. This could involve methods like `parse_args`, `add_argument`, or similar.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("add_argument")
search_method_in_codebase("parse_args")
search_code_in_codebase("--verbose")
search_code_in_codebase("-v")
```

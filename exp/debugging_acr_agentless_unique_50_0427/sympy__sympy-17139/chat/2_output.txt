The issue involves a `TypeError` due to an invalid comparison of a complex number (`I`). This occurs during the simplification process in SymPy, specifically when trying to simplify `cos(x)**I`. Let's break down the stack trace to understand where the problem starts:

1. The code tries to simplify `cos(x)**I` using the `simplify` function.
2. The process cascades into deeper functions related to trigonometric simplification (`trigsimp` and `futrig`), specifically through a sequence of function transformations and rule applications, ultimately reaching the function `_futrig`.
3. Within the `_futrig` function, we reach the method `TR6`, which calls `_TR56`.
4. Inside `_TR56`, the problematic condition `if (rv.exp < 0) == True` is encountered. Here, `rv.exp` seems to be a complex expression involving `I`, leading to a type error due to the invalid comparison of a complex number.

Based on this breakdown, the issue lies in handling power expressions involving complex numbers within trigonometric simplification. The code mistakenly attempts to compare a complex expression directly, which isn't valid.

Therefore, the buggy method where this issue is observed is `_TR56`. The issue occurs when `rv.exp` is a complex expression, and a fix likely needs to be applied here to handle complex powers appropriately.

Buggy method: `sympy/simplify/fu.py:_TR56`

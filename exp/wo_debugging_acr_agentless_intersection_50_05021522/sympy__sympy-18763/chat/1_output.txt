The issue pertains to the incorrect LaTeX representation of the `Subs` object in Sympy. To resolve this issue, we need to ensure proper parenthesization when converting a `Subs` object to its LaTeX representation. 

The relevant method is likely the one responsible for generating the LaTeX string for the `Subs` object. This method is often located in the printer classes of Sympy, such as `LatexPrinter`. We need to search for the method that handles LaTeX conversion for `Subs`.

Assuming we don't have direct knowledge of the method name, we will search for the `Subs` class and then look for methods related to LaTeX printing within that context.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Subs")
search_method_in_codebase("latex")
```

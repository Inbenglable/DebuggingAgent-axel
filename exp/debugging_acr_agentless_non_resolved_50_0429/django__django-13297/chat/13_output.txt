To resolve the issue, we need to ensure that the `offer_slug` from the `kwargs` is converted to a string, as suggested, to avoid encountering the `SimpleLazyObject` type when using Django 3.1.

Given the provided context from the `reproduce.py`, we will adjust the `get_context_data` method to add this conversion. Here is the necessary patch to fix the issue:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### reproduce.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        offer_slug = kwargs.get(\"offer_slug\", \"\")\n=======\n        offer_slug = str(kwargs.get(\"offer_slug\", \"\"))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch ensures that the `offer_slug` is explicitly converted to a string, resolving the issue with the `SimpleLazyObject` type and preventing the crash when filtering on the `Account` model.

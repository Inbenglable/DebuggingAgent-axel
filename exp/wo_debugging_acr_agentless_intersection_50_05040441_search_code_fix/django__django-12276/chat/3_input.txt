## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
FileInput shouldn't display required attribute when initial data exists.
Description
	 
		(last modified by thenewguy)
	 
I think that ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute() (â€‹https://github.com/django/django/blob/e703b93a656b78b9b444bb3a9980e305ed002a70/django/forms/widgets.py#L454) should be moved to FileInput.use_required_attribute() so that required is not output on the html input element that represents FileInput when a file is already set (e.g. already saved on a model instance that is being edited).
Maybe I am overlooking a use case where this is not desirable? I can not think of one.

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To address the issue, I need to examine the source code of the `ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute()` method and assess how it interacts with the `FileInput` in Django's `forms/widgets.py`. I will move this logic to `FileInput.use_required_attribute()` as suggested if no specific use cases requiring its current position are identified. 

Here's the plan:
1. Retrieve the `ClearableFileInput` class code to understand the context.
2. Locate the `use_required_attribute` method within this class.
3. Investigate the `FileInput` class to ascertain where this logic can be moved.

Let's start by fetching the respective source codes:

```python
search_class_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "ClearableFileInput")
search_method_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute")
search_class_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "FileInput")
search_method_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "FileInput.use_required_attribute")
```

==================================================

Your Output:
Based on the information retrieved, we have the code for the `ClearableFileInput` class and its `use_required_attribute` method. We also have the `FileInput` class code but not yet its implementation for the `use_required_attribute` method, which seemingly does not contain this method explicitly. The plan is to adjust the behavior of `FileInput` by implementing `use_required_attribute` in it, using the logic from `ClearableFileInput` if suitable.

I'll proceed to generating the patch by implementing the `use_required_attribute` method directly in the `FileInput` class.

Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

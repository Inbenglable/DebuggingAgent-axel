To resolve the issue of `ax.clear()` adding extra ticks and un-hiding shared-axis tick labels in Matplotlib, modifications need to be made to ensure proper visibility management of shared axes. The problem is identified in the `cla` method, which clears the axes but doesn't appropriately restore visibility settings for shared axes. Let's proceed with the patch creation to resolve this bug:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if self._sharex is not None:\n            self.xaxis.set_visible(xaxis_visible)\n            self.patch.set_visible(patch_visible)\n        if self._sharey is not None:\n            self.yaxis.set_visible(yaxis_visible)\n            self.patch.set_visible(patch_visible)\n=======\n        if self._sharex is not None:\n            # Ensure only primary shared axis retains visibility\n            if self._sharex._shared_axes['x'].get_siblings(self, self._sharex)[0] is self:\n                self.xaxis.set_visible(xaxis_visible)\n            else:\n                self.xaxis.set_visible(False)\n            self.patch.set_visible(patch_visible)\n        if self._sharey is not None:\n            if self._sharey._shared_axes['y'].get_siblings(self, self._sharey)[0] is self:\n                self.yaxis.set_visible(yaxis_visible)\n            else:\n                self.yaxis.set_visible(False)\n            self.patch.set_visible(patch_visible)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Search Section**: The current implementation restores tick visibility for all shared axes without regard for their initial configuration, resulting in excess tick labels being shown.
- **Replace Section**: Before setting visibility, we check if the current axis (`self`) is the primary axis in the shared axis group. Only the primary axis should maintain visible ticks and labels. Secondary axes in the shared group should have their ticks and labels hidden.
- The modification ensures that only one set of tick labels is visible on shared axes and others are correctly hidden as per the initial configuration.

caplog fixture doesn't restore log level after test
From the documentation at https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.0.0/logging.html#caplog-fixture, "The log levels set are restored automatically at the end of the test".
It used to work, but looks broken in new 6.0 release. Minimal example to reproduce:

```
def test_foo(caplog):
    caplog.set_level(42)

def test_bar(caplog):
    print(caplog.handler.level)
```

It prints "0" for pytest<6, "42" after.

</ISSUE>


A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
Given the issue description and the provided test script, the problem appears to stem from the `caplog` fixture not restoring the log level after a test when it should. The test script behavior shows that the log level set in `test_foo` (42) is still present in `test_bar`, indicating the log level was not reset to its original state after `test_foo` was completed.

To address this defect, we need to analyze the behavior of the `caplog` fixture, particularly focusing on how it handles log level modifications and restoration at the end of each test function.

The test appears to indicate that the handling or wrap up after test execution is where the issue lies, which would most likely involve the context or cleanup around tests in the logging handler.

To trace further, we need to observe the method in the pytest codebase responsible for setting and restoring the log level, especially focusing on handler operations with `caplog`. Proceeding, I will observe potential methods involving hook functions or fixture tear-down mechanisms relevant to `caplog`.

Observed method: `src/_pytest/logging.py:LogCaptureFixture.set_level`
==================================================
The initial analysis of the `LogCaptureFixture.set_level` method shows that it sets the log level on line 436 with `logger_obj.setLevel(level)` and presumably restores the original log level later using the `self._initial_logger_levels` dictionary which stores the initial log level on line 435. However, the issue is that these levels aren't restored automatically at the end of the test, as indicated by the user's complaint.

The problem likely lies in how and when these stored initial levels are supposed to be used to reset the log level at the end of a test, which is usually handled in a tear-down or finalization method within the fixture lifecycle.

To identify the root cause, I need to observe the finalization logic of the `LogCaptureFixture` to ensure the log levels stored in `self._initial_logger_levels` are indeed restored. This involves tracing the teardown processes or any cleanup mechanisms related to the fixture, which are typically located in methods like `_finalize`.

To further investigate, I will observe the `_finalize` method, since this is logically connected with restoring states or performing cleanup. 

Observed scope: `src/_pytest/logging.py:120-160`
==================================================
The runtime information provided pertains to the `auto_indent_option`, which seems unrelated to the `caplog` fixture issue and log level restoration. The observed lines of code essentially deal with indentation logic, rather than with logging.

The issue lies in the fact that log levels are not restored after a test completes, and this code snippet does not address that aspect. We are interested in the procedures that involve handling logging fixtures, specifically focusing on the set and reset of log levels.

To further probe into the root of the problem, we need to find the portion of the code that manages the teardown or cleanup of a test using the `caplog` fixture, ensuring that the log levels are reverted correctly after each test. This process will likely be managed by a method in the `LogCaptureFixture` class.

The next logical step is to observe the `_finalize` method which appears pertinent to teardown procedures.

Observed method: `src/_pytest/logging.py:LogCaptureFixture._finalize`
==================================================
The `_finalize` method in the `LogCaptureFixture` class appears to be correctly implemented for restoring logger levels. This method iterates over the initial logger levels stored in `self._initial_logger_levels` and resets them back to their original state at the end of the test. This aligns with the expected behavior described in the documentation. 

However, from the issue description and the tests provided, it seems that the `_finalize` method is not being called as expected after each test, which leads to the log levels not being restored between tests.

The problem might be elsewhere in the lifecycle of test fixtures or in the initialization or integration of this fixture itself, where this `_finalize` method is perhaps not triggered at the correct time or under the correct conditions.

Given this deduction, the next logical step would be to observe how and when the `_finalize` method is invoked within the fixture lifecycle. This would involve understanding how fixture setup and teardown are managed in pytest, particularly for the `caplog` fixture. To trace this, I will need to examine the code responsible for managing fixture finalization.

Therefore, I will move upstream to see how fixtures are finalized, which could lead us to further insights on why `_finalize` isn't called properly.

Observed scope: `src/_pytest/logging.py:LogCaptureFixture.__init__` through any fixture lifecycle management methods. Let's observe:
```plaintext
Observed scope: src/_pytest/logging.py:300-350
```
==================================================
From the analysis and the runtime information, it's apparent that the issue is with the lifecycle management of the `caplog` fixture, specifically its failure to reset logger levels after a test. The `LogCaptureFixture._finalize` method appears to be correctly restoring logger levels, which implies it should be called as part of the exit routine for the fixture context.

The issue may lie in the fact that this finalization isn't being triggered correctly on test completion. This could be due to improper fixture teardown handling or context management within the pytest framework. 

Given this analysis, the problem seems rooted in the triggering and connection of this finalization method within the `caplog` fixture, potentially in the way teardown or fixture finalization is integrated.

To verify this hypothesis and pinpoint the root cause, we should observe the lifecycle management of fixtures, particularly looking for potential gaps in teardown procedures that might prevent `_finalize` from executing as expected.

Therefore, the next step is to trace further up into fixture lifecycle handling to ascertain if `_finalize` is invoked correctly. Observing how the `caplog` fixture is managed and finalized seems like a logical progression.

Observed method: `src/_pytest/logging.py:LogCaptureFixture.__enter__` (to inspect how resources/handlers are acquired and should lead to corresponding teardown).
==================================================
Based on the analysis, the issue arises from the fixture lifecycle management. The `_finalize` method responsible for restoring the original logger levels seems not to be triggered correctly, resulting in the `caplog` fixture retaining modified log levels across tests. The behavior observed in the `catching_logs.__enter__` method adds the handler and modifies log levels, but the exit or teardown procedures (likely in `__exit__` or an equivalent teardown method) are not ensuring level restoration.

The outcome of the tests suggests that while the `LogCaptureFixture` might have a component or mechanism intended to reset log levels, it isn't functioning properly when transitioning between tests, possibly due to mismanaged fixture finalization handling.

To pinpoint the root cause, examining the method responsible for the exit or teardown phase where logger levels should be reset back to their original state is necessary.

Considering that lifecycle management (especially teardown) wasn't captured in the current observation, the next logical step is to delve into how fixture finalization is handled downstream, particularly focusing on any methods connecting `__enter__` with correctly restoring states or levels.

Observed scope: `src/_pytest/logging.py:250-280` (This scope will likely contain `__exit__` or finalization-related methods within the `catching_logs` context manager handling fixture teardown or exit routines.)
==================================================
The current code snippet and the observed behavior suggest that the configurations being observed are related to the logging options and their setup within pytest, specifically through the `add_option_ini` function calls for logging settings parameters. However, this does not directly pertain to the finalization or tear-down aspect impacting the `caplog` fixture behavior.

The problem at hand is related to the finalization of the `caplog` fixture, where it fails to reset the log level to its original state after each test. Since this code does not include relevant setup or teardown operations for the test lifecycle or handling of the `caplog` fixture, it does not assist in understanding why the log level reset is failing.

To locate the buggy method responsible for failing to restore the log levels, we need to further trace how the `caplog` fixture is integrated and finalized. We suspect the critical issue is within the management of fixture lifecycles, likely somewhere connecting the setup (`__enter__`) and teardown/finalization (`__exit__`) of the `caplog` fixture or `LogCaptureFixture`.

The next logical step is to trace into a potentially related method that involves fixture lifecycle management and could be likely responsible for invoking the `_finalize` process, ensuring proper log cleanup after a test is complete.

Observed method: `src/_pytest/logging.py:catching_logs.__exit__` (to check if it formally completes any contextual operations and ensures state restoration, thus possibly holding critical clues to our issue).
==================================================
From the observed runtime information and analysis of the `__exit__` method in the `catching_logs` context manager, it becomes apparent that the `caplog` fixture does not correctly restore the log level when the context exits. The critical part should be at line 309, where the previous log level is supposed to be restored. The runtime output shows that `self.level` is never `None`, but the level restoration operation at line 309 isn't effectively executing or influencing the log level reset as intended after tests. 

Given the symptoms and the area of code under scrutiny, this points to a potential gap in executing the appropriate logic to reset the logging levels back to their initial state before the next test begins.

Given this analysis, let's focus on why this mechanism does not appear to reset the log level effectively. If the `_finalize` method aligns with the exit context (expected here but not actively modifying the level in observed behavior), this suggests a contextual misalignment or incorrect handling at teardown.

The `catching_logs.__exit__` method structure and runtime trace suggest that despite the presence of a check (`if self.level is not None:`), the operation meant to reset (`root_logger.setLevel(self.orig_level)`) isn't actively being performed. This may indicate an issue of `self.level` being improperly managed or not being reset/set to `self.orig_level` as intended in a consistent manner.

To confirm and rectify this defect, the lazy restoration, additions, or changes relevant to `self.orig_level` management within this context may require re-evaluation.

Since the buggy context mentioned seems to rest in the improper restoration of the logging level, let's delve into an upstream or associated mechanism leading up to the exit, where `self.orig_level` is set, stored, or should be effectively reapplied.

Therefore, no further immediate need for additional underlying steps can be identified. Let's review how `self.orig_level` should be handling logger level treatment to assess faulty transitions.

Buggy method: `src/_pytest/logging.py:catching_logs.__exit__`
==================================================

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
Based on the analysis of the issue concerning the `caplog` fixture not restoring log levels between tests, the problematic area is centered on the `catching_logs.__exit__` method, specifically where it fails to reset the logging level as intended. The primary focus is on ensuring that `self.orig_level` is used to restore the log level when exiting the context.

To proceed with generating the patch, I need to review the source code of the `catching_logs.__exit__` method. This will ensure understanding of how the logging levels are being managed and identify where the reset mechanism fails.

Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code for the `catching_logs` context manager, particularly its `__exit__` method, to generate a precise patch.

```python
search_method_in_file("src/_pytest/logging.py", "catching_logs.__exit__")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_file("src/_pytest/logging.py", "catching_logs.__exit__")
RESULT:
#### src/_pytest/logging.py:catching_logs.__exit__
```python
    def __exit__(self, type, value, traceback):
        root_logger = logging.getLogger()
        if self.level is not None:
            root_logger.setLevel(self.orig_level)
        root_logger.removeHandler(self.handler)

```


==================================================

Your Output:
To address the issue with the `caplog` fixture not restoring the log level after a test, we need to ensure that the logging level is properly reset. The `catching_logs.__exit__` method currently includes logic to reset the log level, but it seems to be ineffective.

Given the current analysis and the identified `__exit__` method, it seems we need to ensure that `self.level` and `self.orig_level` are correctly managed. However, before generating a patch, I need to verify the related initialization logic that handles the original level setting in `__enter__`.

Let's proceed to examine the `catching_logs.__enter__` method for insight into how these levels are initially captured, ensuring the exit logic can correctly restore them.

```python
search_method_in_file("src/_pytest/logging.py", "catching_logs.__enter__")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_file("src/_pytest/logging.py", "catching_logs.__enter__")
RESULT:
#### src/_pytest/logging.py:catching_logs.__enter__
```python
    def __enter__(self):
        root_logger = logging.getLogger()
        if self.level is not None:
            self.handler.setLevel(self.level)
        root_logger.addHandler(self.handler)
        if self.level is not None:
            self.orig_level = root_logger.level
            root_logger.setLevel(min(self.orig_level, self.level))
        return self.handler

```


==================================================

Your Output:
The methods `catching_logs.__enter__` and `catching_logs.__exit__` capture the logic for log level management. The `__enter__` method correctly stores the original log level (`self.orig_level`) and sets a new log level based on the minimum of `self.orig_level` and `self.level`. The `__exit__` method is responsible for resetting the log level but currently does not seem to restore the level properly.

Both the `__enter__` and `__exit__` code snippets are available and provide sufficient context regarding how log levels are being managed during a test. With this information, it is clear that an adjustment is needed to ensure the log level is restored correctly when exiting the `catching_logs` context.

As I have the necessary code for these mechanisms, I am prepared to proceed with generating the patch required to fix the described issue. The change will involve verifying the correct restoration of `self.orig_level` in `__exit__`.

Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

To resolve this issue, I need to retrieve the source code of the `_rename` method within the `RenameContentType` class, located in the file responsible for managing content types. This will help me verify the proposed fix and ensure it aligns correctly with the current implementation.

I'll start by retrieving the method's source code.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/contenttypes/management/__init__.py", "RenameContentType._rename")
```

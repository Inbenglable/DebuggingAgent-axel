Based on the retrieved code snippets, we have the implementation details for `get_feature_names`, `_check_vocabulary`, and `_validate_vocabulary`. Here is the analysis of these methods:

- The `get_feature_names` method currently invokes `_check_vocabulary` to ensure `vocabulary_` has been set, which raises a `NotFittedError`.
- The `_check_vocabulary` method uses `check_is_fitted` to verify the presence of the `vocabulary_` attribute.
- The `_validate_vocabulary` method assigns `self.vocabulary_` when a vocabulary is provided directly during initialization.

Since the `_validate_vocabulary` method already sets the `vocabulary_` attribute, the `_check_vocabulary` invocation in `get_feature_names` should acknowledge this and not raise a `NotFittedError`.

Given this, I believe I have sufficient information to proceed with generating a patch that modifies the behavior of the `get_feature_names` method.

Ready generation: `True`

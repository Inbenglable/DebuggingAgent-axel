The issue arises because the `dataset_merge_method` does not correctly handle `DataArray` objects. The high-level `merge()` function succeeds by converting `DataArray` objects to `Dataset` using `obj.to_dataset()`. Implementing a similar logic in `dataset_merge_method` should resolve the problem.

I have obtained the necessary code from both `dataset_merge_method` and `merge` function, and understand how to address the issue.

Ready generation: `True`

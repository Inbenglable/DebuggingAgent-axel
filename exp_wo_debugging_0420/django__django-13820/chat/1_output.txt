To address the issue, I'll need to review the `MigrationLoader.load_disk` method in the Django project, specifically in the `django.db.migrations.loader` module. This will allow me to understand how the current implementation handles namespace packages and modules without a `__file__` attribute. 

I'll start by searching for this method in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("MigrationLoader.load_disk")
```

Based on the analysis of the issue and the provided source code, we identified that the logic for `show_save_as_new` requires additional permission checks for add permissions to ensure that the 'Save as new' button is displayed only if the user has permission to add new objects. 

Here is the necessary patch to resolve this issue:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n\"show_save_as_new\": not is_popup\n            and has_change_permission\n            and change\n            and save_as,\n=======\n\"show_save_as_new\": not is_popup\n            and has_add_permission\n            and has_change_permission\n            and change\n            and save_as,\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch ensures that the `show_save_as_new` attribute is only true if the user has the necessary permissions to add new objects, in addition to all the other existing checks. This should resolve the issue as described.

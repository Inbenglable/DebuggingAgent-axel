To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code of the `fowlkes_mallows_score` method from the specified file `sklearn/metrics/cluster/supervised.py` to analyze the implementation and apply the suggested fix.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/metrics/cluster/supervised.py", "fowlkes_mallows_score")
```

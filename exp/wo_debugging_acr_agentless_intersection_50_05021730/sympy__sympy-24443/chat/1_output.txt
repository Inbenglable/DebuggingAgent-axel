To resolve the issue, we need to examine the `_image()` function in the `sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py` file as it handles the images of permutations which seems to be causing the problem when handling inverted generators within permutation groups. 

I'll first retrieve the source code of the `_image()` method to understand its current implementation and then determine how it can be simplified or fixed.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py", "_image")
```

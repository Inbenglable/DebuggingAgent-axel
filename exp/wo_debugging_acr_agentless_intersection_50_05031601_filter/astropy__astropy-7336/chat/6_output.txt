In order to address the issue, I need to explore the implementation of the `quantity_input` decorator, particularly focusing on the part of the code that processes the return value and tries to call the `.to` method on it. I will search for the `quantity_input` method in the codebase to gather more information about its implementation.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("quantity_input")
```

To address the `IndexError` issue in the `sylow_subgroup()` method from the trace at `sympy/combinatorics/perm_groups.py`, I will implement a fix to ensure that the list removal operations are safely executed within bounds in the `minimal_blocks()` method. Specifically, I will add checks to determine if the indices `i` in `num_blocks[i]` and `blocks[i]` are valid before attempting to delete them.

Here's the patch in the SEARCH/REPLACE format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/combinatorics/perm_groups.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                        del num_blocks[i], blocks[i]\n=======\n                        if i < len(num_blocks) and i < len(blocks):\n                            del num_blocks[i]\n                            del blocks[i]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

Explanation: 
- The modification ensures that the indices `i` for `num_blocks` and `blocks` are within their respective lengths before deletion. This prevents attempts to delete elements using out-of-range indices, which is the cause of the `IndexError`.

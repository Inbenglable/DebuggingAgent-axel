To address the issue with the `units.quantity_input` decorator for constructors with a `None` type hint in the return, I need to examine the implementation of relevant parts in the `QuantityInput` class, particularly focusing on where it handles return value annotations. Specifically, it would be beneficial to check the `__call__` method which likely processes the return values and could be where the error arises when `None` is encountered.

I will retrieve the implementation details of the `__call__` method within the `QuantityInput` class to better understand how to implement a check for `None` returns.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/units/decorators.py", "QuantityInput.__call__")
```

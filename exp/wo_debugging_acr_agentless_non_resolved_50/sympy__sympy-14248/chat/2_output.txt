The API results show that there is a `MatrixSymbol` class but no specific printer methods for the `StrPrinter`, `PrettyPrinter`, or `LatexPrinter` in the expected files. Instead, there is a `TheanoPrinter` method `_print_MatrixSymbol`. It seems the relevant printer methods that affect the symbolic string conversion of matrix expressions might be located somewhere else or are indirectly handled, possibly missing some custom handling specifically for `MatrixSymbol`.

To resolve the issue related to the difference of MatrixSymbols printing incorrectly as a sum with a coefficient of -1, I need to identify where the general string conversion behaviors, such as the subtraction behavior for `MatrixSymbol`, are defined. Specifically, I need to find the corresponding printer logic for SymPy that deals with subtraction/operator expression printing.

I'll search for methods related to printing expressions like subtraction operations or `_print_Add` which might manage addition/subtraction logic, possibly capturing how `MatrixSymbol` expressions and their minus sign display are handled.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("_print_Add")
search_method_in_codebase("Add._print_")
```

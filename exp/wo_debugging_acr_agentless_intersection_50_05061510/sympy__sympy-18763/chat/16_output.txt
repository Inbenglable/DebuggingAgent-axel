To determine whether the issue is resolved:

1. **Patch Review:**
   - The patch modifies the `_print_Subs` method in `sympy/printing/latex.py`.
   - It introduces a check to determine whether parentheses are needed around the expression in the `Subs` object.
   - Specifically, if the expression is an instance of `Add` or `Mul`, parentheses are added to improve LaTeX grouping.

2. **Test Output Analysis:**
   - **Original Output:** Before the patch, there was an `AssertionError` indicating that the LaTeX representation did not have the appropriate parentheses, as expected.
   - **Patched Output:** After applying the patch, the test produces no output, which implies that the assertion passed successfully. This means the expected LaTeX representation matches the actual LaTeX output after the patch.

Given this analysis, it appears that the patch successfully addresses the incorrect parenthesizing of `Subs` in LaTeX printing, as evidenced by the passing test after applying the patch. Therefore, the issue appears to be resolved.

Issue resolved: `True`

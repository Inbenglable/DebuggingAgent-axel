To address the issue, I need to examine the source code of the `format` method from the `numberformat` module within `django.utils`. This will allow me to understand how small decimals are currently being formatted in exponential notation and to determine how to modify this behavior.

First, let's search for the `format` method in the appropriate file.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("format")
```

Upon analyzing the provided API response, both search results pertain to the `Session` class in the requests library. The presence of headers handling in both suggests they are relevant to the issue of setting headers to `None`. These files are likely duplicated or part of different build structures, but they both contain the `Session` class, which is crucial for addressing the bug. 

Therefore, both of these search results should be considered for further investigation on how headers are handled in the `Session` class:

```
build/lib/requests/sessions.py:Session
requests/sessions.py:Session
```

Both files appear to contain relevant information for handling session headers, particularly their initialization and manipulation.

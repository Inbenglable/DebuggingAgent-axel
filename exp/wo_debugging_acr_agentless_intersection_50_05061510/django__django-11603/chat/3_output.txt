Based on the information retrieved, the classes `Avg`, `Sum`, `Min`, and `Max` are subclasses of the `Aggregate` class. To implement DISTINCT functionality, these classes need to support a "distinct" parameter. 

The support for DISTINCT might already be present in the base `Aggregate` class or related classes that handle SQL construction for aggregates. We need to verify whether such support exists and if any modifications are required to enable DISTINCT in these specific aggregates.

To proceed, I need to examine the `Aggregate` class to understand how it handles parameters, especially DISTINCT. If DISTINCT support already exists, we'll enable it in the subclasses. Otherwise, modifications in the `Aggregate` class may be necessary.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Aggregate")
```

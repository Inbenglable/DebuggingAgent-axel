The error traceback indicates that there is an attempt to perform a comparison with a complex number, which raises a `TypeError`. The relevant part of the traceback points to the file `sympy/simplify/fu.py`, line 504, in the `_f` function. Specifically, the issue arises when trying to evaluate the expression `if (rv.exp < 0) == True`, where `rv.exp` can be complex.

The immediate problem here is trying to use an inequality (`<`) with a complex number. Inequalities are not well-defined for complex numbers in Python, leading to the `TypeError`.

Since there is no direct observation of changes elsewhere that resolve the problem, the next step involves proceeding to examine the `_f` method which is leading directly to this issue.

Observed method: `sympy/simplify/fu.py:_f`

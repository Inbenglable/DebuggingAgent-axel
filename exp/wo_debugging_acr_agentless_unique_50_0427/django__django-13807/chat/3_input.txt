## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
loaddata crashes on SQLite when table names are SQL keywords.
Description
	
Steps to reproduce:
Create a Model called Order. (order is a SQL reserved word)
Create fixtures for the model
Use manage.py loaddata to load the fixture.
Notice that it fails with the following error. This is because the table name order is not quoted properly
(0.000) PRAGMA foreign_key_check(order); args=None
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "python3.7/site-packages/django/db/backends/utils.py", line 82, in _execute
	return self.cursor.execute(sql)
 File "python3.7/site-packages/django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py", line 411, in execute
	return Database.Cursor.execute(self, query)
sqlite3.OperationalError: near "order": syntax error
Root Cause
File: python3.7/site-packages/django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py line 327
Function: check_constraints
Details: due to missing back ticks around %s in the SQL statement PRAGMA foreign_key_check(%s)

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To address the issue with SQL reserved keywords like `order` not being quoted properly in SQLite, I need to locate the function `check_constraints` in the specified file `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py` to see how the current code is structured. This will aid in generating the patch to fix the issue. Since the location of the method is known, I'll search for it directly in the specified file.

==================================================

Your Output:
The issue arises because SQL reserved keywords used as table names are not being quoted in the SQL statements, leading to syntax errors. The `check_constraints` function in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py` constructs SQL queries where table names should be quoted to avoid such issues.

From the code snippet retrieved for the `check_constraints` method, I can see that table names are interpolated directly into SQL strings. The solution is to ensure that these table names are correctly quoted using backticks (`) or the appropriate quoting method provided by Django, which would likely involve using `self.ops.quote_name()` for quoting.

Since I have the full implementation of the `check_constraints` function, it's sufficient to proceed with making the necessary changes.

Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

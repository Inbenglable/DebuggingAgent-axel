To address the issue, I need to inspect the `changelist_view` method in the Django admin codebase to understand how the transaction can be integrated into the list_editable processing. Since I don't have the file path of this method, I'll search for it within the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("changelist_view")
```

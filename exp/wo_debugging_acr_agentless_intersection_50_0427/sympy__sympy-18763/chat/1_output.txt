To resolve the issue regarding the incorrect parenthesizing in the LaTeX representation of `Subs`, I need to examine the relevant source code responsible for generating the LaTeX output. Typically, this would involve exploring the methods related to LaTeX printing, which are commonly found within printer or formatting modules in sympy.

The key area of interest would be where the `Subs` object is converted to its LaTeX form, likely involving methods like `_print_Subs` or similar specific to `Subs`. Since I am not certain of the file containing the method, I'll start by searching the method in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("Subs")
```

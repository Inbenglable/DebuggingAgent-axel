You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue, I need to understand the code logic around the comparison in the file `fu.py`, especially focusing on the method where the error occurs. We need to examine specifically the `_f` function located at line 504 to see how to modify the comparison logic to handle complex numbers properly.

Therefore, the necessary step is to retrieve the source code of the `_f` method. It might also be beneficial to have a look at the class structure if `_f` is a method within a class.

```python
search_code_in_file("sympy/simplify/fu.py", "if (rv.exp < 0) == True:")
search_method_in_file("sympy/simplify/fu.py", "_f")
```

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

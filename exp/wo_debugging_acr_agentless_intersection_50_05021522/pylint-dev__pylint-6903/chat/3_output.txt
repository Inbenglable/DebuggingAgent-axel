To resolve the issue with the `_query_cpu` function returning zero, we'll modify the function to ensure it returns at least 1 if the calculated available CPU is zero. This will prevent Pylint from crashing when `--jobs=0` is used.

Here is the patch in SEARCH/REPLACE format:

```pythony
### pylint/lint/run.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return avail_cpu
=======
    return avail_cpu or 1
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, I'll provide the edit result in JSON format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### pylint/lint/run.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    return avail_cpu\n=======\n    return avail_cpu or 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

To fix the issue with the `trim_docstring` function in the Django project, I'll apply the proposed solution by modifying the code to skip the indentation check for the first line of the docstring. Here's the patch in the required format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())\n=======\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch correctly updates the `indent` calculation by skipping the first line of the `lines` list when determining the minimal indentation level, addressing the issue reported.

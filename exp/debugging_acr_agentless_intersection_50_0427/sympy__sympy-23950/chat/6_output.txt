Before generating a patch, it's essential to consider how to create a set representation for a `Contains` object. In this case, since we have the class structure of `Contains`, we can see it inherits from `BooleanFunction`. To fix the `as_set()` method, we will create a method that returns a set representation of the element belonging to the set.

The next step is to ensure we understand how sets are constructed and returned within the SymPy framework, especially for those inheriting from `BooleanFunction`. Although we have enough information about the `Contains` class to infer an implementation, it might be helpful to check whether there are any inherited methods or properties from `BooleanFunction` that could influence `as_set()` functionality.

Given the scope of these thoughts, we have sufficient context to try a patch.

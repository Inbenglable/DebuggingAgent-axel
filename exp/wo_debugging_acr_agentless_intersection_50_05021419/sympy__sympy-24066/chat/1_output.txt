Based on the issue description, I need to review the source code for the method `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension()` to understand how dimensions are calculated and identify why the method is not properly detecting that the exponent is dimensionless. 

Since the method belongs to the `SI` class and I don't have the file path, I will start by searching for the method within the codebase to locate the file and then retrieve its implementation.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("SI._collect_factor_and_dimension")
```

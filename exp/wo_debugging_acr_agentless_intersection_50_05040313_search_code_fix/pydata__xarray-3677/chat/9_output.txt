To determine if the issue is resolved, let's review the patch and the test outputs:

### Patch Review
The patch description indicates adding a check in the `dataset_merge_method` to convert a `DataArray` to a `Dataset` before proceeding with the merge operation:
- The line `if isinstance(other, xr.DataArray):` checks if `other` is a `DataArray`.
- `other = other.to_dataset()` converts the `DataArray` to a `Dataset`.

However, the patch introduces a reference to `xr` without importing it in the `merge.py` module file. This results in a `NameError` when the patch is executed.

### Test Output Analysis

#### Original Output
The original output showed an `AttributeError` because the `DataArray` was not being properly handled during the merge operation.

#### Patched Output
The patched output results in a `NameError: name 'xr' is not defined` due to the lack of an import statement for `xr` (i.e., `import xarray as xr`). This stops the code from executing the type conversion correctly and fails the merge process.

### Conclusion
Given the information above, the patch introduces a `NameError` which prevents it from successfully fixing the original issue. Therefore, the issue remains unresolved.

**Issue resolved: `False`**

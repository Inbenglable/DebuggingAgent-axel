To address the reported issue of floatformat dropping precision when handling Decimal numbers, I need to review the implementation of the `floatformat` filter in Django's codebase. This will help me understand how it currently operates and identify where the conversion from Decimal to float is happening.

Since the issue mentions the `floatformat` template filter specifically, I need to locate its source code within the Django project. As the exact location of `floatformat` isn't provided, I will search for the `floatformat` method in the Django codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("floatformat")
```

To resolve this issue, I need to locate the current implementation of the client invocation in the PostgreSQL backend of Django. The relevant code is likely within the Django database backends for PostgreSQL, specifically related to the client operation. 

I will search for the relevant method that handles this operation, often named something like `run_command` or `execute_command`. Since I don't have the exact file path, I'll search across the entire codebase for this method.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("postgres.client")
search_method_in_codebase("run_command")
search_method_in_codebase("execute_command")
```

After reviewing the patch and analyzing the test outputs, it's clear that the issue is not resolved. The patch intended to fix the incorrect representation of sets and dictionaries by the `srepr` function. However, the output from the test after applying the patch remains unchanged, showing that the expected output is still not achieved:

- The expected output for a set `{x, y}` was `FiniteSet(Symbol('x'), Symbol('y'))`, but it remains `{y, x}`.
- The failure message is identical before and after the patch, indicating no change in behavior.

This implies that the patch did not successfully apply the intended functionality to process set and dictionary types into the expected SymPy representations (`FiniteSet` and `Dict`).

Issue resolved: `False`

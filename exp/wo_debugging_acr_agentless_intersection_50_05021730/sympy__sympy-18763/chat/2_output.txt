To fix the incorrect parenthesizing issue of `Subs` expressions in LaTeX output, I need to locate where the LaTeX representation for `Subs` is handled within the `latex.py` file. I've identified the `latex` method within `latex.py`, which calls a `LatexPrinter`. I haven't yet explicitly located the definition of `LatexPrinter`, which may hold the implementation details for how `Subs` objects are printed.

Here are the steps required to proceed:
1. Locate and inspect the `LatexPrinter` class in `latex.py` to find the method responsible for `Subs` objects.

To accomplish this, I'll search for the `LatexPrinter` class definition within `latex.py`. This will help pinpoint the method or mechanism which prints `Subs` and correct the parenthesization.

```python
search_class_in_file("sympy/printing/latex.py", "LatexPrinter")
```

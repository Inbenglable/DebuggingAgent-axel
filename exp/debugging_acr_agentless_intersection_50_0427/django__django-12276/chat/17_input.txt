You are a PR reviewer that needs to review the patch generated by a bug repair agent and determine whether the issue is fixed or not.
This is the bug issue, which is in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
FileInput shouldn't display required attribute when initial data exists.
Description
	 
		(last modified by thenewguy)
	 
I think that ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute() (â€‹https://github.com/django/django/blob/e703b93a656b78b9b444bb3a9980e305ed002a70/django/forms/widgets.py#L454) should be moved to FileInput.use_required_attribute() so that required is not output on the html input element that represents FileInput when a file is already set (e.g. already saved on a model instance that is being edited).
Maybe I am overlooking a use case where this is not desirable? I can not think of one.

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
## REPRODUCE TEST
```
import traceback
import sys
from django import forms
from django.forms.widgets import FileInput
from django.test import TestCase
from django.conf import settings
from django.test.utils import setup_test_environment, teardown_test_environment
from django.test.runner import DiscoverRunner

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

class FileInputForm(forms.Form):
    file_field = forms.FileField(widget=FileInput)

class FileInputTest(TestCase):
    def test_file_input_required_attribute(self):
        # Create a form instance with initial data
        form = FileInputForm(initial={'file_field': 'initial_file.txt'})
        # Render the form to HTML
        html_output = form.as_p()
        # Check if the 'required' attribute is in the HTML output
        if 'required' in html_output:
            e = AssertionError("The 'required' attribute is present in the FileInput widget when initial data exists.")
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise e

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Set up minimal Django settings
    settings.configure(
        DEBUG=True,
        INSTALLED_APPS=[
            'django.contrib.contenttypes',
            'django.contrib.auth',
        ],
        DATABASES={
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': ':memory:'
            }
        },
        ROOT_URLCONF=__name__,
        SECRET_KEY='fake-key',
    )
    # Set up the test environment
    setup_test_environment()
    # Run the test
    runner = DiscoverRunner()
    failures = runner.run_tests(['reproducer'])
    # Teardown the test environment
    teardown_test_environment()
    # Exit with the appropriate code
    sys.exit(bool(failures))
```

And this is the original output when running the test (before applying the patch):
## ORIGINAL OUTPUT
```

    "setup_test_environment() was already called and can't be called "
RuntimeError: setup_test_environment() was already called and can't be called again without first calling teardown_test_environment().

```

The repair agent has tried to generate a patch to fix the issue:
## PATCH CONTEXT
<PATCH_CONTEXT>
To resolve the issue and ensure that the `use_required_attribute()` method is correctly applied to the `FileInput` class, similar to its functionality in the `ClearableFileInput`, we need to implement a method in the `FileInput` class that considers the presence of initial data. Here are the necessary modifications:

```pythony
### django/forms/widgets.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class FileInput(Input):
=======
class FileInput(Input):
    def use_required_attribute(self, initial):
        return super().use_required_attribute(initial) and not initial
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This patch introduces a `use_required_attribute` method in the `FileInput` class, which behaves similarly to that in the `ClearableFileInput` class, ensuring the 'required' attribute is not applied if initial data exists.

Here's the final edit presented in JSON format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/forms/widgets.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass FileInput(Input):\n=======\nclass FileInput(Input):\n    def use_required_attribute(self, initial):\n        return super().use_required_attribute(initial) and not initial\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```
</PATCH_CONTEXT>

After applying the patch, the output of the test is:
## PATCHED OUTPUT
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-12276/reproduce.py", line 56, in <module>
    failures = runner.run_tests(['reproducer'])
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-12276/django/test/runner.py", line 692, in run_tests
    self.setup_test_environment()
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-12276/django/test/runner.py", line 527, in setup_test_environment
    setup_test_environment(debug=self.debug_mode)
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-12276/django/test/utils.py", line 110, in setup_test_environment
    "setup_test_environment() was already called and can't be called "
RuntimeError: setup_test_environment() was already called and can't be called again without first calling teardown_test_environment().

```

Now, please first review the patch and analyse the test output before and after the patch, to determine whether the issue is fixed or not.

And finally, tell me whether the issue is fixed or not by replying with:
Issue resolved: `True/False`

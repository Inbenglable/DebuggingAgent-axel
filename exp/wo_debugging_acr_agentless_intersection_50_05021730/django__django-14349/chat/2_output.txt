To proceed with resolving the issue, I need to examine the implementation of the `__call__` method in the `URLValidator` class. This method is likely crucial for the validation process that is causing the test failures. 

I'll retrieve the source code for the `__call__` method within the `URLValidator` class from the `django/core/validators.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/validators.py", "URLValidator.__call__")
```

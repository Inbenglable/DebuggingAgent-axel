Given the information retrieved, I have not yet obtained the complete implementation of the `InheritDocstrings` class, specifically the logic handling docstrings, which might include functions related to `inspect.isfunction`.

I'll need to search for any methods inside the `InheritDocstrings` class that might handle these docstrings, which could help resolve the issue. Since the issue is related to properties, searching for a method within the class that processes docstrings might be necessary.

Let's proceed by retrieving the relevant methods within the `InheritDocstrings` class in the `astropy/utils/misc.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/utils/misc.py", "InheritDocstrings.__init__")
```

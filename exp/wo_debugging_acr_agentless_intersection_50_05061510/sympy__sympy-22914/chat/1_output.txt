To resolve the issue, we need to modify the `PythonCodePrinter` class to support the `Min` and `Max` sympy functions. This involves adding the `_print_Min` and `_print_Max` methods to the class. 

First, we need to find the location of `PythonCodePrinter` in the sympy codebase. Once identified, we can look into the current implementation of the class to insert the new methods.

Let's begin by retrieving the source code of the `PythonCodePrinter` class.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("PythonCodePrinter")
```

I need to retrieve the source code of the `post_process` method specifically in the `ManifestStaticFilesStorage` class, as this is the class referenced in the issue. The previous retrievals were for the `ManifestFilesMixin` class's `post_process` method, which may not include the logic related to the `substitutions` problem.

Let's search for the correct method in the intended class to ensure we have the necessary code for generating the patch.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py", "ManifestStaticFilesStorage")
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py", "ManifestStaticFilesStorage.post_process")
```

Let's review the patch and analyze the test output.

### Patch Review

The patch modifies the `trim_docstring` function in `django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py` to address the issue of calculating the indentation when the first line of a docstring is not empty. Here's a summary of the patch change:

- **Original Code:**
  ```python
  indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())
  ```

- **Patched Code:**
  ```python
  indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())
  ```

The patch changes the code to skip the first line while calculating the minimum indentation, which properly handles docstrings with text on the first line.

### Test Output Analysis

- **Original Output:**
  The original output indicates an `ImportError` when trying to import `simplify_exception` from `django.contrib.admindocs.views`. This error prevents the test from running successfully, which means the test setup itself was not correct or complete before applying the patch.

- **Patched Output:**
  Even after applying the patch to the `trim_docstring` function, the test output remains unchanged, showing the same `ImportError`. This means that the root cause of the test failure is not with the `trim_docstring` function itself but with the test setup.
  
### Conclusion

Since the test outputs are identical before and after applying the patch, this indicates that the problem is related to the test setup and importing the `simplify_exception`, rather than the patch itself.

The issue in the `trim_docstring` function seems to be fixed according to the modification needed for the problem described in the issue. However, the reproducibility test cannot verify it because it fails due to an ImportError unrelated to the specific issue within the `trim_docstring` logic.

Thus, based on the patch and original description of the issue, the issue itself appears to be resolved despite the failure in running the test due to unrelated ImportError problems.

Issue resolved: `True`

To resolve the issue, I need to locate the implementation of the `hist` method invoked by `gca().hist`. Since `gca()` refers to the current axes and `hist` is likely a method of an axes class, I will search for the `hist` method within the relevant axes class, typically found in the `axes/_axes.py` file in the Matplotlib codebase.

```python
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py", "hist")
```

The source code for the `as_sql` method of both the `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` classes is available, and I can see where the current timezone is unconditionally retrieved and used. To resolve the issue, the handling of the `tzinfo` parameter needs to be adjusted to respect the timezone information passed by the developer.

I have gathered all necessary information from the provided code snippets and am ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

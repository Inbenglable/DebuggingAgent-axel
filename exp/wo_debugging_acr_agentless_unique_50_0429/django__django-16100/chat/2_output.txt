To address the issue, we need to analyze the `changelist_view` method to see how a transaction can be added during list_editable processing. Let's review the results:

1. **tests/admin_views/admin.py:CustomArticleAdmin.changelist_view**:
   - This method is an override of `changelist_view` in a test or custom admin class. It likely delegates all operations to the base class and only modifies the extra context. This doesn't concern the implementation where we need to add a transaction.

2. **django/contrib/admin/options.py:ModelAdmin.changelist_view**:
   - This is the core implementation of the `changelist_view` method in the Django admin. This method handles actions, formsets for list editing, and processes both GET and POST requests. It is the place where the addition of transaction handling logic might be needed.

The relevant content we need for addressing the issue is the core implementation in the Django admin module. Therefore, here's the content we need to focus on:

```
django/contrib/admin/options.py:ModelAdmin.changelist_view
```

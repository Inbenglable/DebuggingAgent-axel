To address the issue where `combine_by_coords` raises a `ValueError` for non-monotonic global indexes even when the coordinates are identical, we'll modify the relevant section of the function. Here's the patch in search/replace format:

```pythony
### xarray/core/combine.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            if dim in concatenated:
=======
            if dim in concatenated and dim not in datasets[0].coords:
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This modification specifically prevents the check for monotonicity on dimensions that are identical across all provided datasets, adhering to the documented behavior that identical coordinate dimensions "will be ignored."

Now, here's the edit result in JSON format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### xarray/core/combine.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            if dim in concatenated:\n=======\n            if dim in concatenated and dim not in datasets[0].coords:\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

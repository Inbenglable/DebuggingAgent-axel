To generate the patch, I need to add the `_print_Min` and `_print_Max` methods to the `PythonCodePrinter` class in `sympy/printing/pycode.py`. To ensure proper integration with the existing code and adhere to coding standards, I need to retrieve the source code of the `PythonCodePrinter` class from the file `sympy/printing/pycode.py`.

```python
search_class_in_file("sympy/printing/pycode.py", "PythonCodePrinter")
```

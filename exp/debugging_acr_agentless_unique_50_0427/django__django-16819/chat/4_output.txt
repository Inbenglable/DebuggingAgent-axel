To generate the patch, I need to review the source code of the `check_excessive_operations` method within the `reproduce.py` file. This method is identified as the location of the issue, but I currently lack its implementation details.

I will use the search API to retrieve the method's code.

```python
search_method_in_file("reproduce.py", "check_excessive_operations")
```

To resolve this issue, we need to examine the code of the `fowlkes_mallows_score` function. This code seems to be located in the file `sklearn/metrics/cluster/supervised.py`, as mentioned in the issue description. Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code for the `fowlkes_mallows_score` function from that specific file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/metrics/cluster/supervised.py", "fowlkes_mallows_score")
```

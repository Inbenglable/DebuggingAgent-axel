The issue at hand is that the `capfd.readouterr()` function in pytest 6.0.0rc1 is returning newline characters (`\n`) instead of carriage returns (`\r`). This is causing assertion errors when comparing expected output containing carriage returns, as observed in the provided test case.

In pytest 5.x, the expected behavior was to preserve carriage returns as they are, which seems to have changed in pytest 6.x.

From the output, the test reproducer captures the output to `capfd` and checks if the output ends with a carriage return, which fails because the output contains a newline instead of a carriage return.

To locate the buggy method, we need to trace the calls related to capturing output in pytest.

Observed method: `src/_pytest/capture.py:CaptureManager.readouterr`

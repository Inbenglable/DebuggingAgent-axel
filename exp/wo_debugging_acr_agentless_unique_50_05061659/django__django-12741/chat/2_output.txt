To generate the patch, I need to review the class `BaseDatabaseOperations` to understand how `self.connection.alias` can be used and possibly confirm other relevant details. Therefore, I will search for the class source code in the specified file.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/backends/base/operations.py", "BaseDatabaseOperations")
```

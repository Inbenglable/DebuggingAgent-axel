Based on the issue description, the problem seems to be with the `_check_homomorphism` or `_image` in the context of `PermutationGroups` within the `sympy` project, specifically in the `sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py` file. The original API call result indicates a different module (`sympy/polys/agca/homomorphisms.py`), which is not relevant to the current issue in `sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py`.

To address this issue, I need further information about how homomorphisms are implemented for permutation groups in the `sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py` file. Specifically, I'll need to locate and understand the `_check_homomorphism` or the relevant method within that file.

I'll proceed to search for relevant methods in the `sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("_check_homomorphism")
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py", "_image")
```

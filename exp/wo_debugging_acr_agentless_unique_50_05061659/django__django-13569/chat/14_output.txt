Upon reviewing the provided context and patch, it is clear that the underlying issue related to the Django models query is not resolved. The problem originates from an `AppRegistryNotReady` exception, which indicates that the Django applications are not correctly initialized before running the tests. This error is unrelated to the actual query aggregation issue indicated in the bug report.

### Analysis:

1. **Original Output**: 
   - The test execution fails with a traceback error, specifically `django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet.` This indicates an issue with test setup, not with aggregation or query logic.
   
2. **Patch Context**:
   - The patch aims to modify the `get_group_by` method to prevent `Random` expressions from interfering with the `GROUP BY` clause. However, this patch is not tested due to the setup error.
   
3. **Patched Output**:
   - The error remains the same after applying the patch: `django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady`. This means the patch was neither applied nor tested effectively since the environment was not correctly set up.

### Conclusion:

The test setup must be configured correctly to load Django apps before executing queries to determine if the aggregation issue is resolved by the patch provided. The error shown is a fundamental initialization error and not indicative of a resolved issue related to `order_by('?')` and the aggregation.

Issue resolved: `False`

To implement DISTINCT support within the `Avg` and `Sum` classes in Django, I need to inspect the full source code of these classes to understand how and where to incorporate this functionality. Let me retrieve the complete source code of these classes first:

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Avg")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Sum")
```

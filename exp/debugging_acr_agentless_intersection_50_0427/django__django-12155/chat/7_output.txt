Based on the issue description and analysis, we'll need to make a change in the `trim_docstring` function to avoid calculating the indentation from the first line of a docstring. Here's the patch to fix the issue:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())\n=======\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This modification skips the first line when calculating the minimum indentation, which should resolve the issue with rendering docstrings when the first line is not empty.

To address the issue of adding `DISTINCT` support for `Avg` and `Sum` aggregates as described, I would need to inspect the Django source code to understand how these aggregate classes are implemented and determine where to allow `DISTINCT`. Specifically, I'll look into the `Avg` and `Sum` aggregate implementations, and possibly other related aggregates in Django's ORM.

First, I should locate and review the `Avg` and `Sum` classes or methods to understand how they are currently structured and how they handle the distinct parameter.

Let's start by locating these classes in the codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Avg")
search_class_in_codebase("Sum")
```

To address the issue and ensure a correct fix, I need to retrieve the source code of the `_cstack` method, as it has been identified as a probable source of the bug. By obtaining the code, I can analyze the exact logic and identify where the improper combination of matrices occurs.

Let's proceed with retrieving the source code:

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/modeling/separable.py", "_cstack")
```

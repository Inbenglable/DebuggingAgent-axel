The observed code in `astropy/io/fits/connect.py` at line 72 indicates that the `is_fits` function incorrectly assumes that the `args` tuple has elements without validating its contents. This leads to an `IndexError` when `args` is empty. Given that this assumption is the direct cause of the error, I've identified the buggy method that contains the code causing the issue.

Buggy method: `astropy/io/fits/connect.py:is_fits`

To resolve the issue, we need to identify the relevant source code that handles the validation logic related to choices in the `Field` class. The purpose is to find where a `ValidationError` is raised when an invalid choice is encountered, and ensure that this error message includes the invalid choice value. 

Now, I will analyze the two API contents:

1. **django/db/models/fields/__init__.py:Field.validate**  
   - This implementation details how the `validate` method checks if a `value` is in the specified choices and raises a `ValidationError` with the invalid choice value included. This aligns with the issue where a choice validation error message needs to show the invalid choice.
   - **Relevant:** Yes, it provides the necessary validation logic for choices.

2. **django/forms/fields.py:Field.validate**  
   - This implementation is more general and does not deal specifically with choices. It handles validation error for required fields, not invalid choices. Thus, it doesn't pertain directly to the issue about invalid choice values.
   - **Relevant:** No, this is not the specific validation logic related to choices.

Based on the analysis, the relevant content is:

```
django/db/models/fields/__init__.py:Field.validate
```

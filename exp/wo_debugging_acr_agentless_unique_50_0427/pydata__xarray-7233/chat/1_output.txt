To address the issue of `ds.Coarsen.construct` demoting non-dimensional coordinates to variables, I need to review the source code of the `construct` method used within the `coarsen` process. First, I'll search for the relevant method within the project to understand its current implementation. 

Since the method might be specific to `coarsen`, I should search for it within the context of the `xarray` project's codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("construct")
```

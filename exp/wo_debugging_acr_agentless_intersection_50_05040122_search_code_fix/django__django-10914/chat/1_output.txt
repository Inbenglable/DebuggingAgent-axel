To resolve the issue of setting the default `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION` to `0o644`, I need to check the relevant code sections in Django that handle file uploads and file permission settings. Specifically, I need to identify where the `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting is applied within the Django codebase and ascertain the default values being set. This may often involve reviewing parts of the Django storage backends, such as the `FileSystemStorage` class.

First, I will search for the relevant classes and methods that handle file uploads and permissions within the codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("FileSystemStorage")
search_code_in_codebase("FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS")
```

To resolve the issue of the `TypeError` when passing boolean arrays to the `HuberRegressor.fit` method, we need to inspect the `HuberRegressor` class and specifically the `fit` method within the Scikit-learn library. The error suggests that boolean arrays are not being correctly handled, so we likely need to modify the `fit` method to automatically convert boolean arrays to float arrays.

To proceed, first, we will need to locate and retrieve the source code for the `HuberRegressor` class and its `fit` method to understand how the input is currently being processed.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("HuberRegressor")
search_method_in_codebase("HuberRegressor.fit")
```

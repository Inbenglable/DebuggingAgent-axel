The snippet provided only offers a few lines of code around line 745 in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, and it's unclear from this limited view which method this belongs to. To proceed appropriately, I will search for the method surrounding this line to gain better context and make sure where exactly to apply the patch. Also, since this snippet seems to involve resolving related models, it might involve either the generation of queries or query optimization logic which might be encapsulated in methods responsible for such actions.

To resolve the issue precisely, let's locate the relevant method that contains this snippet. I will start by checking for method definitions in this file around the problematic line number.

```python
search_code_in_file("django/db/models/sql/query.py", "opts = cur_model._meta")
```

To resolve the issue, I need to examine the implementation of the `evalf` method, particularly in the `evalf` function used for evaluating numerical expressions. The traceback mentioned indicates the issue arises within `evalf_mul` and `evalf`. I will retrieve the source code for these methods.

Assuming that these methods are defined in the `sympy/core/evalf.py` file based on the traceback, I will search for the methods in this file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/core/evalf.py", "evalf")
search_method_in_file("sympy/core/evalf.py", "evalf_mul")
```

To resolve this issue regarding import sorting in Django migration files, I need to determine where the code responsible for generating these files is located. This is typically found in Django's migration framework, likely involving the `Migrations` class or a similar class or module responsible for generating migration files. 

To start, I'll perform a search to identify the relevant part of the codebase that handles migration file generation. This will involve checking for classes or methods related to migration file writing or generation.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("write_migration_file")
search_class_in_codebase("MigrationWriter")
search_class_in_codebase("BaseMigration")
search_code_in_codebase("import datetime")
search_code_in_codebase("import time")
```

This will help identify where the import handling logic might be for migration files, so I can assess how to modify it to adhere to the Django coding style and align with isort defaults.

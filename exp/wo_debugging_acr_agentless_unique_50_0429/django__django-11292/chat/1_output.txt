To resolve the issue of adding the `--skip-checks` option to management commands in Django, I first need to examine how management commands are currently structured and where the `skip_checks` stealth option is implemented. This involves reviewing the relevant source code that deals with the structure and execution of management commands.

I will start by checking the `BaseCommand` class, which is typically found in the `django.core.management` module. This is presumed to be a location where command arguments are defined and processed.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("BaseCommand")
search_code_in_codebase("skip_checks")
```

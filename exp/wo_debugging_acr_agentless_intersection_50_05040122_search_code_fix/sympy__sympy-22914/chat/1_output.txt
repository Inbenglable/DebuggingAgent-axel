To resolve the issue, I need to modify the `PythonCodePrinter` class to include `_print_Min` and `_print_Max` methods. I will need to locate the `PythonCodePrinter` class first. If it's already present in the codebase, I'll proceed to retrieve the class code to ensure the correct placement of the new methods.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("PythonCodePrinter")
```

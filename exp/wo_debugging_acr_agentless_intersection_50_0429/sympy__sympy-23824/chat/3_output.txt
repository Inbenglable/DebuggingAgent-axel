To resolve the issue mentioned in the `kahane_simplify` function of the `sympy` codebase, we need to ensure that the leading gamma matrices without contractions are inserted in the correct order at the end of the function. Currently, these matrices are being reversed during insertion. We will update the relevant part of the code within `kahane_simplify`.

Let's provide the patch to fix this issue:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/physics/hep/gamma_matrices.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n[ri.insert(0, free_pos[i]) for ri in resulting_indices]\n=======\n[ri.append(free_pos[i]) for ri in resulting_indices]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation:
In the original code, the line `[ri.insert(0, free_pos[i]) for ri in resulting_indices]` is used to prepend free indices to the beginning of each result list `ri`. This results in reversing their order for leading gamma matrices. Changing this to `[ri.append(free_pos[i]) for ri in resulting_indices]` correctly appends each leading free index to the end of `ri`, maintaining the order as initially intended.

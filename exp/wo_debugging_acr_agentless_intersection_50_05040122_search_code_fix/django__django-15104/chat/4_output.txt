Based on the information gathered, I need to modify the `only_relation_agnostic_fields` method in the `MigrationAutodetector` class to prevent a `KeyError` by safely removing the 'to' key from the `deconstruction` dictionary.

Here's the `SEARCH/REPLACE` patch to resolve the issue:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/migrations/autodetector.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                del deconstruction[2]['to']\n=======\n                deconstruction[2].pop('to', None)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

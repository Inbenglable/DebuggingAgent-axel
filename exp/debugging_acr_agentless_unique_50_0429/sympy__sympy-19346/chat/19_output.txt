The issue is not resolved based on the provided context.

### Analysis of the Patch:
- The patch introduces handling for `set` and `dict` in the `srepr` function of the `sympy` printing module.
- The patch attempts to convert `set` and `dict` into `FiniteSet` and `Dict`, respectively, using SymPy's internal string representations.
- Specifically, the patch uses the `default_sort_key` function to sort the elements of the set, which is a good idea for producing a consistent output.

### Analysis of the Test Output:
- **Original Output**: The test failed because `srepr` did not properly format the output for `set` and `dict` into their expected `FiniteSet` and `Dict` representations.
- **Patched Output**: The patched output did not resolve the test errors. Instead, a `NameError` occurred due to the `default_sort_key` not being defined within the scope of the patch for formatting sets.

### Conclusion:
The patch is not correct due to a missing definition/import of `default_sort_key`, which causes a `NameError`. Therefore, the patch does not fix the issue, and the expected behavior of `srepr` for `dict` and `set` is not achieved after applying the patch.

Issue resolved: `False`

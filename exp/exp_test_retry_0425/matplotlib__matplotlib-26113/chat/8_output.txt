The patch addresses the inconsistency in the behavior of the `mincnt` parameter when the `C` parameter is supplied to the `hexbin` function in the `Axes` class. The key change is the modification of the condition from `len(acc) > mincnt` to `len(acc) >= mincnt`, ensuring consistent handling of data points when `mincnt` is specified regardless of whether `C` is provided.

Observations:

1. **Patch Context**: 
   - The patch changes the behavior to consider bins with exactly `mincnt` data points, aligning the behavior with the expected outcome from the issue description.

2. **Reproduce Test**:
   - The test script generates hexbin plots for various configurations of the `mincnt` and `C` parameters.
   - Output files are generated for visual verification (not directly verifiable here as they are images).

3. **Original vs. Patched Output**:
   - Both before and after the patch, there's no direct textual output from the script, as it focuses on generating image files.
   - However, the change in code logic should result in the expected visual behavior, aligning with the user's expectations as described in the issue.

Overall, the patch does apply the logical change described in both the issue and the expectation to resolve the inconsistent handling of the `mincnt` parameter when the `C` parameter is used. The adjustment should ensure that bins with exactly `mincnt` data points are included when `C` is specified, which was the requested behavior.

Issue resolved: `True`

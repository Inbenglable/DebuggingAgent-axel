To resolve the issue, I need to locate and modify the `trim_docstring` function within the Django codebase, since the reported bug and the suggested fix are both centered around this function. Before generating a patch, I must first retrieve the source code of the `trim_docstring` method.

Since I do not know the file path, I will search for this method in the entire codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("trim_docstring")
```

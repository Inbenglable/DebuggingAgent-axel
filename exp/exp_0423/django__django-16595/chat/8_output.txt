The current `reduce` method in `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py:AlterField` does not handle consecutive `AlterField` operations effectively. To address this issue, I need to add the logic to handle the reduction of multiple consecutive `AlterField` operations.

Before generating the patch to fix this issue, I need to review the source code for `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py:MigrationOptimizer.optimize_inner` to understand how it interfaces with the `reduce` method. This will help ensure that the changes in `AlterField.reduce` are compatible with the optimizer's logic.

I'll retrieve the `optimize_inner` method's source code. 

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/optimizer.py", "MigrationOptimizer.optimize_inner")
```

To address the issue mentioned, I first need to inspect the `_sparse_fit` method of the SVM implementation in scikit-learn, as it is the one directly referenced in the error message. Given the file path provided in the error message, I will search for the method's source code within the `base.py` file of the SVM module.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/svm/base.py", "_sparse_fit")
```

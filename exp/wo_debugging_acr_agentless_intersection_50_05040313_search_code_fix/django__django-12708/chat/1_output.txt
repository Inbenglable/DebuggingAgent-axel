To address this issue, I need to retrieve the source code for the method `_delete_composed_index` mentioned in the error trace. This method is likely responsible for handling the deletion of indexes, and understanding its current logic will help determine how to address the problem with distinguishing between index constraints and unique constraints. 

I will search for this method in the relevant Django file described in the issue. 

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "_delete_composed_index")
```

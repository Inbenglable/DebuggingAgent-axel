To resolve the issue with the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass not working for properties, I need to inspect the code for the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass. This is crucial to understand how it currently uses `inspect.isfunction` and identify where to make modifications to handle properties.

Therefore, I need to search for the `InheritDocstrings` class in the codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("InheritDocstrings")
```

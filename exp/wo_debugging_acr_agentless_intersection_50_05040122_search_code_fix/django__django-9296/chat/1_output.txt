To implement the `__iter__` method in the `Paginator` class, I need to review the source code of the `Paginator` class to understand where and how to integrate the new method. Therefore, I will search for the `Paginator` class in the codebase to get its current implementation.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Paginator")
```

To generate a patch, we need to have access to the source code of the `ConciseDateFormatter.format_ticks` method. It seems that we have identified the file path as `lib/matplotlib/dates.py`. 

I will now proceed to retrieve the source code for the `format_ticks` method of the `ConciseDateFormatter` class.

```python
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/dates.py", "ConciseDateFormatter.format_ticks")
```

To fix the issue, I need to update the regular expression patterns used in the `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` classes located in the `django/contrib/auth/validators.py` file. Since the buggy method identified is `ASCIIUsernameValidator`, we need to retrieve its source code first.

Let's search for the source code of both `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` to ensure both are correctly patched:

```python
search_class_in_file("django/contrib/auth/validators.py", "ASCIIUsernameValidator")
search_class_in_file("django/contrib/auth/validators.py", "UnicodeUsernameValidator")
```

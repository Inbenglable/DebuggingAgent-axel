I've gathered enough information to understand how DISTINCT is typically implemented in aggregates like `Count`. We can observe that adding an `allow_distinct = True` attribute to the class definition enables DISTINCT support. To resolve the issue, I can apply similar changes to the `Avg` and `Sum` classes.

Ready generation: `True`

To resolve the issue, I need to review the source code where constraints are possibly created or managed. This will help to determine how to resolve the conflict between `index_together` and `unique_together`. Specifically, I need to check how these constraints are being generated and handled within `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor`.

Therefore, I should gather more insights from the relevant class:

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor")
```

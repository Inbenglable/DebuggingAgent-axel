To resolve the `IndexError: tuple index out of range` issue occurring in `identify_format` method due to the `is_fits` function, we need to modify the `is_fits` function to safely check the length of `args` before accessing its first element. This ensures that the code does not attempt to access an element which does not exist, preventing the `IndexError`. 

Here is the patch to modify the `is_fits` function:

```pythony
### astropy/io/fits/connect.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return isinstance(args[0], (HDUList, TableHDU, BinTableHDU, GroupsHDU))
=======
    return len(args) > 0 and isinstance(args[0], (HDUList, TableHDU, BinTableHDU, GroupsHDU))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Here is the JSON representation of the search/replace edit:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### astropy/io/fits/connect.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    return isinstance(args[0], (HDUList, TableHDU, BinTableHDU, GroupsHDU))\n=======\n    return len(args) > 0 and isinstance(args[0], (HDUList, TableHDU, BinTableHDU, GroupsHDU))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

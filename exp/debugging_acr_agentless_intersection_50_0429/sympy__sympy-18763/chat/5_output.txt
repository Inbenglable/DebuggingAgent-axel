Here is the patch to resolve the issue of incorrect parenthesizing within the `LatexPrinter._print_Subs` method in the `sympy/printing/latex.py` file.

```pythony
### sympy/printing/latex.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        latex_expr = self._print(expr)
=======
        latex_expr = self.parenthesize(expr, PRECEDENCE['Mul'])
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This modification ensures the expression inside `Subs` is correctly parenthesized when it involves operations of lower precedence than multiplication.

Now, here is the JSON-formatted result of the patch:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/printing/latex.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        latex_expr = self._print(expr)\n=======\n        latex_expr = self.parenthesize(expr, PRECEDENCE['Mul'])\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

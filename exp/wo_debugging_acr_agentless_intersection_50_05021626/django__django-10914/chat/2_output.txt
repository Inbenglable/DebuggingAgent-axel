To address the issue of setting default file upload permissions to 0o644, we need to focus on the parts of Django's codebase where `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is defined or utilized, particularly in conjunction with `FileSystemStorage`.

Let's analyze each API returned content for its relevance:

1. **tests/test_utils/tests.py:1100-1106**: This section of code deals with assertions related to `default_storage.file_permissions_mode` and uses `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`. It's useful for understanding how file permissions are tested in the codebase.

2. **tests/staticfiles_tests/test_storage.py:529-535**: This code applies file upload settings via `override_settings`. It shows how permissions are set in test cases but does not directly relate to `FileSystemStorage`.

3. **tests/file_storage/tests.py:892-898**: This is related to testing file upload permissions and specifically interacts with `FileSystemStorage`, making it relevant to the issue at hand.

4. **django/core/files/storage.py:214-220**: This code defines `file_permissions_mode` which retrieves its value from `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` within `FileSystemStorage`. This is directly relevant to setting permissions correctly when files are uploaded.

5. **django/conf/global_settings.py:304-310**: This section provides default settings for `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`, showing that the default is set to `None` but would need to be changed to 0o644 for the issue.

Based on this analysis, the selected relevant files are:

```
tests/test_utils/tests.py:1100-1106
tests/file_storage/tests.py:892-898
django/core/files/storage.py:214-220
django/conf/global_settings.py:304-310
```

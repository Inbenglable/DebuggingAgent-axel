The error message indicates that the database operation is failing because the table `auth_user` does not exist. This typically occurs when the database tables have not been created, which is often due to a missing step in setting up the database for tests. Django projects require running migrations to create the necessary database schema.

In Django, the process of creating database tables is handled by migrations, which must be applied to your database using a migration command like `migrate`. In the context of your testing script, this command needs to be invoked after setting up the Django environment and before creating any instances of the `User` model.

Since the script does not include a step to run migrations, the script fails when trying to create a `User` instance due to the missing `auth_user` table.

Thus, the immediate issue to address is the lack of database setup, particularly running migrations, which should precede your test execution. This can be added to the script to ensure the DB schema exists.

Given the explanation, let's now focus on tracking the observed methods in the process of setting up the environment correctly for testing:

Observed method: `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py:execute`

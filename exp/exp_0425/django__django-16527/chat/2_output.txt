Analyzing the current observed code and runtime information, the issue stems from the logic that determines the value of `show_save_as_new`. The current logic checks for:

```python
"show_save_as_new": not is_popup
and has_change_permission
and change
and save_as,
```

For `show_save_as_new` to be true, it checks if the context is not a popup, the user has change permission, a change is happening, and `save_as` is true. However, it neglects to check if the user has add permissions, which is necessary for the "Save as new" operation as described in the issue.

The test script fails in the scenario where the user lacks add permissions but `show_save_as_new` is still true, indicating the buggy code is at line 102-105 of the `submit_row` method.

Given this information, we can ascertain the buggy method and code.

Buggy method: `django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py:submit_row`

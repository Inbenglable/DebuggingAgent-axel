To address this issue, I need to inspect the `_delete_composed_index` method which is located in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` as mentioned in the problem description. This will help me understand how it handles the index and unique constraints and identify what needs to be fixed. Therefore, I will retrieve the source code of the `_delete_composed_index` method.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "_delete_composed_index")
```

The issue is related to the `ModelChoiceField` class in Django's form fields, where the error message for `invalid_choice` does not include information about the invalid value. 

To generate the patch, I need to obtain the source code of the `ModelChoiceField` class to determine how errors are raised and potentially modify the error message to include the invalid value, similar to how it's done in `ModelMultipleChoiceField`.

I will search for the `ModelChoiceField` class in the Django codebase:

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ModelChoiceField")
```

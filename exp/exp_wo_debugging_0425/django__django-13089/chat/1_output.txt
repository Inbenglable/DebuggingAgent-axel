To resolve the issue, I'll need to retrieve the source code of the `_cull` method located in `django/core/cache/backends/db.py`. This is because the problem occurs in this particular method when working with the database cursor. I need to see the full code to propose an appropriate fix. Let's proceed with retrieving the code of this method.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/cache/backends/db.py", "_cull")
```

## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Getting http://.example.com raises UnicodeError
Attempting to get e.g. `http://.example.com` results in a `UnicodeError`. It seems like the intention so far has been to raise `InvalidUrl` instead (see e.g. [this line](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/ca6f9af5dba09591007b15a7368bc0f006b7cc50/requests/models.py#L401)).

I see there was some hesitation in fixing a similar issue (#4168) and would like to add that even catching the error just to rethrow as a requests exception would be beneficial.

## Expected Result

Based on PR #774: `InvalidUrl: URL has an invalid label.`

## Actual Result

`UnicodeError: encoding with 'idna' codec failed (UnicodeError: label empty or too long)`

## Reproduction Steps

```python3
import requests
requests.get("http://.example.com")
```

## System Information

    $ python -m requests.help

```

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To address the issue, we need to examine the part of the code responsible for handling URLs and the specific part that should raise an `InvalidUrl` exception instead of allowing a `UnicodeError` to propagate. The issue description points to a specific line in `requests/models.py`, which suggests that might be our starting point. Let's retrieve the source code for the relevant method(s) around that area to identify where the `UnicodeError` occurs and ensure it is properly handled.

```python
search_method_in_file("requests/models.py", "prepare_url")

Your Output:
Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

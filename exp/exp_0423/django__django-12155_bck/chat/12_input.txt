#### ISSUE
docutils reports an error rendering view docstring when the first line is not empty
Description
	
Currently admindoc works correctly only with docstrings where the first line is empty, and all Django docstrings are formatted in this way.
However usually the docstring text starts at the first line, e.g.:
def test():
	"""test tests something.
	"""
and this cause an error:
Error in "default-role" directive:
no content permitted.
.. default-role:: cmsreference
The culprit is this code in trim_docstring:
indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())
The problem is that the indentation of the first line is 0.
The solution is to skip the first line:
indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())
Thanks.

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
Based on the given test case and the execution trace, the issue description states that an error is raised when rendering a docstring if the first line of the docstring isn't empty. The issue is in the `trim_docstring` function where the calculation of indentation includes the first line. The test case, however, indicates that no error occurs, suggesting that whatever change the issue description proposes has already been implemented or the problem exists elsewhere.

In the execution trace:
- `lines = ['test tests something.', '        ']` captures the docstring lines.
- The `indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())` successfully calculates the indent without raising errors.
  
Despite the suggestion to skip the first line, the observed behavior doesn't raise the error, and therefore it may look like the expected behavior. Given the observed execution doesn't produce an error and stops with `SystemExit: 0`, it aligns with the desired program flow when the issue is resolved or negating any potential error that originates from the `trim_docstring` function when using a docstring with non-empty first line.

Thus, from the execution trace, the observed function `trim_docstring` is the place to analyze to check why the error described doesn't appear. The function already handles trimming without a specific condition applied to skip the first line.

To determine the solution to the problem described, the next step is to observe the existing logic in more detail or check another method to fully ensure where the processing finally avoids throwing errors.

Observed method: `django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py:trim_docstring`
==================================================
Given the detailed runtime information of the `trim_docstring` method, the source of the abnormal behavior lies in how docstring indentation is being managed. The key issue arises in the calculation of `indent` on line 37:

```python
indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())
```

Indents may be incorrectly calculated due to including the first line, which normally has no leading spaces. The proposal in the issue description was to skip the first line:

```python
indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())
```

Let's proceed to analyze the current code of the `trim_docstring` function to verify if implementing the proposed change resolves the abnormal behavior:

```python
trim_docstring:
27	def trim_docstring(docstring):
28	    """
29	    Uniformly trim leading/trailing whitespace from docstrings.
30	
31	    Based on https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/#handling-docstring-indentation
32	    """
33	    if not docstring or not docstring.strip():
34	        return ''
35	    # Convert tabs to spaces and split into lines
36	    lines = docstring.expandtabs().splitlines()
37	    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())
38	    trimmed = [lines[0].lstrip()] + [line[indent:].rstrip() for line in lines[1:]]
39	    return "\n".join(trimmed).strip()
```

Based on the runtime trace and the exact calculation of `indent`, it appears to be a potential root cause. We can locate and directly adjust the calculation to skip the first line, as suggested in the issue description:

By doing so, we will proceed to the following correction:

```python
trim_docstring:
37	    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())
```

Letâ€™s implement this change and directly observe if it resolves the issue:

Buggy method: `django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py:trim_docstring`

The adjusted code is:

```python
indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())
```

Please implement this fix to resolve the issue mentioned. After implementing, run the test case again to verify if the error no longer occurs. If additional downstream runtime analysis is required to verify the fix, it can be done based on the updated scenario.

Next steps:
1. Apply the fix.
2. Re-run the provided test case to verify the behavior.
3. Confirm no errors appearing upon rendering non-empty first-line docstrings.

If the observed error persists, indicate the observed scope for deeper runtime information. However, considering the provided issue and runtime data, this fix is likely to resolve the issue.

==================================================

Your Output:
I've already retrieved the source code for the `trim_docstring` method. Given that I have all the necessary information to fix the issue by adjusting the indentation calculation, I am ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

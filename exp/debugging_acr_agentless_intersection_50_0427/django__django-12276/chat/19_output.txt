To determine whether the issue is resolved, let's analyze the provided information.

### Patch Review:
The patch proposes adding a `use_required_attribute` method in the `FileInput` class to mimic the behavior of the `ClearableFileInput` class. The added method checks whether the `required` attribute should be included and is designed to prevent the `required` attribute from being added when initial data already exists. This logic seems correct to resolve the issue described.

### Test Output Analysis Before the Patch:
The original test output is a `RuntimeError` indicating that `setup_test_environment()` was called twice without a prior call to `teardown_test_environment()`. This error is unrelated to the functionality being tested (i.e., the presence of the `required` attribute) and suggests a problem with the test setup itself, not with the `FileInput` functionality.

### Test Output Analysis After the Patch:
The patched test output shows the same `RuntimeError`, indicating that the test setup issue remains unresolved, which means the error encountered during testing is not affected by changes in the `FileInput` class.

### Conclusion:
The failure to execute the test is due to improper setup and teardown sequence rather than the functionality of the patch. Since we don't have successful test results, it's impossible to definitively determine if the patch resolves the initial problem. Therefore, more appropriate test setup and execution are needed to verify the patch.

Issue resolved: `False`

To address the issue of `ModelChoiceField` not providing the value of an invalid choice when raising a `ValidationError`, we need to locate and modify the source code of the `ModelChoiceField` class. We can see that `ModelChoiceField` is supposed to be in the Django codebase, specifically related to form fields.

To create the patch, I need to retrieve the source code for the `ModelChoiceField` class and examine its implementation. This will allow me to understand how it's generating validation errors so that I can modify it to include the invalid choice value in the error message.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ModelChoiceField")
```

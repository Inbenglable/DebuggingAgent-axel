You are a PR reviewer that needs to review the patch generated by a bug repair agent and determine whether the issue is fixed or not.
This is the bug issue, which is in the **sympy** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Incorrect parenthesizing of Subs
Here is an example.
```python
>>> from sympy import Subs
>>> from sympy.abc import x,y
>>> 3*Subs(-x+y, (x,),(1,))
```
LaTeX printing of this gives:  
```python
'3 \\left. - x + y \\right|_{\\substack{ x=1 }}'
```

It would be better to be parenthesized to:  
```python
'3 \\left. \\left(- x + y\\right) \\right|_{\\substack{ x=1 }}'
```

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
## REPRODUCE TEST
```
from sympy import Subs
from sympy.abc import x, y
from sympy import latex
import traceback
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    expr = 3 * Subs(-x + y, (x,), (1,))
    latex_expr = latex(expr)
    expected_latex = r'3 \left. \left(- x + y\right) \right|_{\substack{ x=1 }}'
    
    try:
        assert latex_expr == expected_latex, f"Expected LaTeX: {expected_latex}, but got: {latex_expr}"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

And this is the original output when running the test (before applying the patch):
## ORIGINAL OUTPUT
```

```

The repair agent has tried to generate a patch to fix the issue:
## PATCH CONTEXT
<PATCH_CONTEXT>
To resolve the issue, we need to modify the `_print_Subs` method in `sympy/printing/latex.py` to ensure that expressions within `Subs` are appropriately parenthesized when printed as LaTeX. We will modify the method to wrap the `latex_expr` in parentheses.

Here is the patch to apply:

```pythony
### sympy/printing/latex.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        return r'\left. %s \right|_{\substack{ %s }}' % (latex_expr,
=======
        return r'\left. \left(%s\right) \right|_{\substack{ %s }}' % (latex_expr,
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now let's provide the changes in JSON format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/printing/latex.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        return r'\\left. %s \\right|_{\\substack{ %s }}' % (latex_expr,\n=======\n        return r'\\left. \\left(%s\\right) \\right|_{\\substack{ %s }}' % (latex_expr,\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```
</PATCH_CONTEXT>

After applying the patch, the output of the test is:
## PATCHED OUTPUT
```

```

Now, please first review the patch and analyse the test output before and after the patch, to determine whether the issue is fixed or not.

And finally, tell me whether the issue is fixed or not by replying with:
Issue resolved: `True/False`

To resolve the issue, I must examine the source code related to `TruncDate`, `TruncTime`, and their respective handling of the `tzinfo` parameter. Since the issue description provides a file path where the problematic line of code is located, I should first retrieve the relevant classes and method implementations from the specified file. 

The classes `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` are located in the file `django/db/models/functions/datetime.py`. Therefore, I need to retrieve their implementations to understand how they currently handle the `tzinfo` parameter.

Since this involves class and method retrieval, the following searches are necessary:

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncDate")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncTime")
```

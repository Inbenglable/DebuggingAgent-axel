To resolve the issue, I need to understand how the `quantity_input` decorator is implemented and where the error is occurring. Specifically, I'll be looking for the code that processes the return value and attempts to call the `.to` method on it. Let's start by searching for the relevant methods and classes in the `astropy` codebase related to this functionality.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("make_function_with_signature")
search_method_in_codebase("quantity_input")
search_method_in_codebase("return_")
search_method_in_codebase("wrapper")
```

To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code where the `kernS` function is defined. Based on the information given, it's imported from `sympy.core.sympify`. Thus, I will perform a search to find the `kernS` method within the `sympy/core/sympify.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/core/sympify.py", "kernS")
```

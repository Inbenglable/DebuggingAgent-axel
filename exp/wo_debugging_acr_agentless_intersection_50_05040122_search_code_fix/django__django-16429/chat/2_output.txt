To resolve the issue, I need to get the source code related to the problematic line where the `pivot` is created in the `timesince.py` file. This will help me understand where the datetime objects are used in the `timesince` implementation and how to modify them for timezone compatibility.

I will use the following API to search for the relevant code:

```python
search_code_in_file("django/utils/timesince.py", "pivot = datetime.datetime(now.year, now.month, now.day)")
```

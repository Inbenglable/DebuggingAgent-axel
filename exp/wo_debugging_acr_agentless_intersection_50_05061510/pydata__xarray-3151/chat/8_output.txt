The patch modifies the code to handle cases of non-monotonic identical coordinates in the `combine_by_coords` function without raising a `ValueError`. The change introduces a check to verify if all datasets have identical coordinates for the problematic dimension. If they are identical, the monotonicity requirement is bypassed, allowing the function to proceed without error.

### Analysis:

1. **Original Output Review**:
   - A `ValueError` was raised when the coordinates were non-monotonic, even if they were identical across datasets. This was due to the monotonicity check that failed because the `y` dimension was not in strict order.

2. **Patch Review**:
   - The patch adds a condition to check for identical coordinates across all datasets for the specific dimension before raising a `ValueError`. If the coordinates are identical, it bypasses the exception even though they are non-monotonic.

3. **Patched Output Review**:
   - After applying the patch, the output shows "Issue is fixed. Exiting with code 0," indicating that the patched function executed successfully without raising any errors, suggesting that the logic to accept non-monotonic but identical coordinates worked.

### Conclusion:

The patch resolves the issue by allowing `combine_by_coords` to handle non-monotonic identical coordinates without throwing an error, conforming to the expected behavior as described in the issue statement. Based on the modified code and successful test output post-patch, the issue appears to be fixed.

Issue resolved: `True`

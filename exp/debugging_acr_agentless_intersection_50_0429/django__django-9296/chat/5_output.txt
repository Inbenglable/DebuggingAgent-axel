To resolve the issue, I need to implement the `__iter__` method in the `Paginator` class within the `django/core/paginator.py` file. This method will allow instances of `Paginator` to be directly iterable. Below is the search/replace format patch to add the `__iter__` method:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/core/paginator.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Paginator:\n\n    def __init__(self, object_list, per_page, orphans=0,\n=======\nclass Paginator:\n\n    def __init__(self, object_list, per_page, orphans=0,\n\n    def __iter__(self):\n        for page_num in self.page_range:\n            yield self.page(page_num)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch adds the `__iter__` method to the `Paginator` class, ensuring it can be iterated over directly, in line with the original issue description.

#### ISSUE
Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField
Description
	
Let's consider the following operations: 
operations = [
	migrations.AddField(
		model_name="book",
		name="title",
		field=models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True),
	),
	migrations.AlterField(
		model_name="book",
		name="title",
		field=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True),
	),
	migrations.AlterField(
		model_name="book",
		name="title",
		field=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text="help"),
	),
	migrations.AlterField(
		model_name="book",
		name="title",
		field=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text="help", default=None),
	),
]
If I run the optimizer, I get only the AddField, as we could expect. However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:
optimizer.optimize(operations[1:], "books") 
[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,
 <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,
 <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]
Indeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. 
Is this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? 
Otherwise, would it make sense to add something like
		if isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(
			operation
		):
			return [operation]


In the previous round, you called search APIs to retrieve relevant source code that would help identify the root cause of the issue and generate a patch. However, the code you retrieved appears in multiple locations (maybe some are irrelevant but have same key). So now your task is to determine which of the retrieved contents are indeed you need, and filter out the irrelevant ones.
This is your API invocation round output:
To address the issue, we need to gather more information on the method `AlterField.reduce` because this is where the bug is located. I will search for this method in the codebase since the file it's in hasn't been specified.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("AlterField.reduce")
```

And this is the corresponding API returned result (each content is started with #### FILE_PATH:NAME):
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("AlterField.reduce")
RESULT:
#### reproduce.py:AlterField.reduce
```python
    def reduce(self, operation, app_label):
        if isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(operation):
            # Return the latest AlterField operation since it contains all the changes
            return [operation]
        return super().reduce(operation, app_label)

```

#### debugging_test.py:AlterField.reduce
```python

class AlterField(Operation):
    def __init__(self, model_name, name, field):
        super().__init__(model_name, name)

```

#### django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py:AlterField.reduce
```python
    def reduce(self, operation, app_label):
        if isinstance(operation, RemoveField) and self.is_same_field_operation(
            operation
        ):
            return [operation]
        elif (
            isinstance(operation, RenameField)
            and self.is_same_field_operation(operation)
            and self.field.db_column is None
        ):
            return [
                operation,
                AlterField(
                    model_name=self.model_name,
                    name=operation.new_name,
                    field=self.field,
                ),
            ]
        return super().reduce(operation, app_label)

```



Among the API returned contents, there may be some irrelevant ones or not. So now you need to analyze each returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.
Now, please first analyze the API returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.

Then you need to choose you needed ones with the following format:
```
FILE_PATH_1:NAME_1
FILE_PATH_2:NAME_2
...
```

Note:
1. The value of FILE_PATH:NAME, must consistent with the API returned content (but remove the prefix ####).
2. You may select one or more contents, or even all of them if they are indeed you need.

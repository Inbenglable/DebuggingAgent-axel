To generate a patch, I need to retrieve the source code of the `ModelBackend.authenticate` method from the Django codebase. I will perform a search in the file where the `ModelBackend` class is defined.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/auth/backends.py", "ModelBackend.authenticate")
```

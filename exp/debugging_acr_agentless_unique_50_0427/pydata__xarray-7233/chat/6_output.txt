### Analysis of Current Code and Abnormal Behavior

The section of code observed in `Coarsen.construct` focuses on managing variable reshaping and setting coordinates to the resultant dataset. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Reshape and Coordinate Handling**:
   - Line `974`: Variables are reshaped using the provided dimensions in `window_dim`.
   - Line `976`: Coordinates to be retained are determined by intersecting `window_dim` with existing coordinates, neglecting non-dimensional ones.
   - Line `977`: The resultant dataset (`reshaped`) has its coordinates set only from `should_be_coords`, thus excluding non-dimensional ones like `day`.

2. **Observations**:
   - Non-dimensional coordinates are not preserved primarily due to strictly intersecting `window_dim` keys with existing coordinates.
   - The exclusion logic doesn't account for any non-dimensional coordinates, resulting in them being demoted to variables in the final result.

### Abnormal Behavior
The assertion error during runtime traces potentially due to the inability to maintain `day` as a coordinate. The root issue is identified as not correctly marking non-dimensional coordinates.

### Steps Toward Locating the Bug

Given the focus is on reshaping variables and coordinate logic, adjustments should be made in determining the coordinates to be retained (lines `976-977`). This section is pivotal where non-dimensional coordinates should be considered.

### Decision on Further Observation

The observed scope primarily reveals the flaw in setting coordinates. Adjusting `should_be_coords` logic to include non-dimensional ones seems necessary, though it seems isolated to the current method.

Thus, I will choose to iterate over this particular segment:

Buggy method: `xarray/core/rolling.py:Coarsen.construct`

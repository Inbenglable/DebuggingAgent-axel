The traceback observed (`NameError: name 'sys' is not defined`) indicates an issue in the `run_debugging_test.py` script where the `sys` module is not properly imported or defined. However, this is not directly related to the PostgreSQL backend issue in Django.

The primary issue in the Django project concerns replacing the use of a temporary `.pgpass` file with directly setting the `PGPASSWORD` environment variable using `subprocess.run`. The focus is on the `DatabaseClient.runshell_db` method in `django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py`.

Analyzing the code of the `DatabaseClient.runshell_db`, we can see that lines 40-68 handle the setting up of a temporary `.pgpass` file and cleaning up afterward. The intent is to replace this segment with a more straightforward approach utilizing `subprocess.run` and setting `PGPASSWORD` in the environment.

The suspicious section here is from lines 40-68, where the current method uses a temporary file for password storage. We need to refactor this section to set `PGPASSWORD` directly using `subprocess.run`.

So, now I will focus on these lines to plan how they can be refactored. Observing this scope will provide information on precisely how the password handling is functioning, which is key to our refactor.

Observed scope: `django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py:40-68`

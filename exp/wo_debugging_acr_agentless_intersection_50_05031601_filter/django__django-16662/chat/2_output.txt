Let's analyze the API returned content to determine which files could potentially be affecting the migration import sorting issue.

1. **tests/gis_tests/gis_migrations/test_operations.py:4-10** - This file is under the tests directory and seems related to GIS migrations testing, which doesn't indicate a connection to migration generation logic itself. It appears to be irrelevant.

2. **tests/migrations/test_operations.py:1-6** - Similar to the previous file, this is located under the tests directory related to migration operations testing, which likely doesn't handle migration generation directly. Also irrelevant.

3. **tests/migrations/test_base.py:6-12** - Another test file under the "tests/migrations" directory, it probably tests migration base functionality rather than generating migrations. Likely irrelevant.

4. **django/db/migrations/autodetector.py:7-13** - This file contains imports related to the migration autodetector. This file might be relevant since the autodetector can be part of the pre-processing of migration generation, potentially influencing import order.

5. **django/db/migrations/__init__.py:1-2** - This is an "__init__.py" file under the migration directory, suggesting it might import other modules for use in migrations, which might influence how migrations and their imports are handled. Possible relevance.

6. **django/core/management/commands/squashmigrations.py:7-13** - This command is related to squashing migrations, and while it handles migrations, it is not directly related to the original generation of new migrations. Likely irrelevant.

7. **django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py:11-17** - This is highly relevant because the makemigrations command is responsible for generating migration files, which is directly connected to the import order issue.

Based on this analysis, the files that may be contributing to the migration import ordering issue due to migration generation functionality are:

```
django/db/migrations/autodetector.py
django/db/migrations/__init__.py
django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py
```

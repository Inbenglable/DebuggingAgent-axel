### Analyzing the Observed Code and Abnormal Program Behavior

The issue at hand revolves around the `trim_docstring` function in the `django.contrib.admindocs.utils` module. The function is designed to take a docstring, trim common leading indentation, and return the processed docstring.

We have a test docstring:
```python
'''test tests something.
    This is a second line with proper indentation.
        This line has extra indentation.
    Back to normal indentation.'''
```

The root of the issue appears to be in the handling of the first line of the docstring when calculating the common leading indentation. The code that calculates the minimum indentation skips empty lines but incorrectly includes the first line, which typically has no indentation (value `0`). This inclusion might corrupt the calculation of the common leading indentation, especially if the first non-empty line starts immediately without leading spaces.

### Observed Code

Here is the relevant part of the `trim_docstring` function:
```python
def trim_docstring(docstring):
    if not docstring or not docstring.strip():
        return ''
    lines = docstring.expandtabs().splitlines()
    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())
    trimmed = [lines[0].lstrip()] + [line[indent:].rstrip() for line in lines[1:]]
    return "\n".join(trimmed).strip()
```

Potential problematic line:
```python
indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())
```

### Abnormal Behavior

The abnormal behavior reported is that `docutils` fails to render view docstring correctly when the first line is not empty. The error message:
```
Error in "default-role" directive:
no content permitted.
.. default-role:: cmsreference
```

This is likely because the first line's lack of leading indentation zeros out `indent`, leading to a miscalculation in subsequent line indentations.

### Locating the Buggy Method

Based on the observations and the described behavior, it is evident that the core issue lies in the indentation calculation in the `trim_docstring` function.

### Conclusion

The buggy method is identified as follows:
```python
Buggy method: django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py:trim_docstring
```

We will modify this function to skip the first line, preventing it from affecting the calculation of the common leading indentation.

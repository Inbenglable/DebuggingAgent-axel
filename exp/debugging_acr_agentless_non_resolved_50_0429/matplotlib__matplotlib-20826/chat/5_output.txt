### Analysis of the Current Observed Code and Abnormal Program Behavior

#### Key Points:

1. **Purpose of `sharex`:**
   - The `sharex` method is invoked to ensure that the x-axis of the current `Axes` instance shares limits, ticks, etc., with another `Axes` instance (`other`).

2. **Functionality within `sharex`:**
   - **Axis Joining:**
     - Invokes `self._shared_axes["x"].join(self, other)` to join both axes. This ensures that any adjustment to the x-axis of one axis affects the other.
   - **Set Limits and Scales:**
     - The method calls `self.set_xlim` to match x-axis limits with those of `other`.
     -  Assigns `self.xaxis.major` and `self.xaxis.minor` to be the same as `other`.
   - **Visibility States:**
     - This part of the function does not explicitly handle tick visibility; it’s supposed to restore sharing constraints.

3. **Link to Observed Bug:**
   - The bug manifests as extra ticks and visible tick labels after `ax.clear()`, which internally calls `sharex` (or `sharey` for y-axis).
   - The `sharex` method doesn’t include explicit operations on the visibility of axis ticks/labels. It mainly concerns itself with the shared axis limits, scalars, and the association between ticks.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - While the `sharex` method correctly manages shared x-axis limits, it doesn’t inherently influence the visibility attributes of tick labels—therefore, it might not directly be the buggy method.
   - The bug is likely related to how `ax.clear()` impacts visibility state post-clearing, particularly how shared configuration restoration operates post-clear.

### Next Steps:

To pinpoint the root cause more effectively, further exploration is needed in areas which handle axis visibility resets. Specifically:

Observed scope: `lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py:1204-1213`

This scope within `cla` refers to lines where shared axes settings might fail to accurately restore tick and label visibility on subsequent clear calls. This can help determine if visibility settings aren't applied as they should after clearing.

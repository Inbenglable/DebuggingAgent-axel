To determine if the issue is resolved, let's evaluate each part of the information provided:

1. **Original Issue**:
   - The function `combine_by_coords` raises a `ValueError` if there are identical coordinates that are non-monotonic. The expectation is that for identical coordinates that do not vary between datasets, the function should not insist on monotonicity.

2. **Reproduction Test**:
   - A test was created to reproduce this issue. It deliberately uses non-monotonic identical coordinates to check if the function still raises the `ValueError`.

3. **Original Test Output**:
   - The original test raises a `ValueError`, confirming the presence of the bug.

4. **Patch Description**:
   - The patch modifies the function `combine_by_coords` by adding a condition to check if all datasets have identical coordinates for a given dimension. If the coordinates are identical across datasets, the monotonicity check is bypassed.

5. **Patched Test Output**:
   - After applying the patch, the test runs without any errors and exits successfully, indicating "Issue is fixed. Exiting with code 0."

6. **Analysis**:
   - Since the patch alters the logic to exclude monotonicity checks for identical coordinates, aligning the implementation with the documentation, and the patched output indicates the test passes without errors, it suggests that the issue is indeed resolved.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the patch and the change in test outcomes:

Issue resolved: `True`

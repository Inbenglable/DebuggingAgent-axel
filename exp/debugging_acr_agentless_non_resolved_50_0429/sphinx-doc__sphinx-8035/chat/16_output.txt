To determine if the issue is resolved, let's evaluate the elements provided:

### Patch Review
The patch modifies the handling of the `:private-members:` option by allowing it to take a list or set of specific private member names, in addition to a boolean. This change is implemented in the `filter_members` method. The edit checks if `self.options.private_members` is an instance of list or set, enabling more granular control over which private members are included in the documentation.

### Test Output Analysis
The test output before applying the patch indicates that the `:private-members:` option does not support specifying certain private members. Both `_private_function` and `_PrivateClass` were documented, which is contrary to the expectation that only `_private_function` should be documented.

After applying the patch, the output of `_private_function` being present and `_PrivateClass` not being found demonstrates the intended behavior. This confirms that the patched version adjusts the `:private-members:` option to selectively document specified private members when a list or set is provided.

Despite errors regarding missing files and warnings, the specific issue about private member documentation appears corrected with the patch. The test's assertions related to private member selection pass, indicating success in that specific context.

### Conclusion
Based on the patch application and its targeted effect within the tests, the issue about private member specification in the `:private-members:` option appears to be resolved. Thus:

Issue resolved: `True`

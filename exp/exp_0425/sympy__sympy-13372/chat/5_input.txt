You are a PR reviewer that needs to review the patch generated by a bug repair agent and determine whether the issue is fixed or not.
This is the bug issue, which is in the **sympy** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
UnboundLocalError in evalf
```
>>> Mul(x, Max(0, y), evaluate=False).evalf()
x*Max(0, y)
>>> Mul(Max(0, y), x, evaluate=False).evalf()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./sympy/core/evalf.py", line 1285, in evalf
    rf = evalf_table[x.func]
KeyError: Max

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "./sympy/core/evalf.py", line 1394, in evalf
    result = evalf(self, prec + 4, options)
  File "./sympy/core/evalf.py", line 1286, in evalf
    r = rf(x, prec, options)
  File "./sympy/core/evalf.py", line 538, in evalf_mul
    arg = evalf(arg, prec, options)
  File "./sympy/core/evalf.py", line 1308, in evalf
    r = re, im, reprec, imprec
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'reprec' referenced before assignment
```

I found this after changing the order of Mul args in https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/13059.

Based on the code, I think the elif clauses that define reprec and imprec should have an `else: raise NotImplementedError`. That appears to fix it, although I didn't try to debug to see why the arg order is mattering here.

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
## REPRODUCE TEST
```
from sympy import Mul, Max, Symbol

x = Symbol('x')
y = Symbol('y')

# This works
print("Test 1: Mul(x, Max(0, y), evaluate=False).evalf()")
print(Mul(x, Max(0, y), evaluate=False).evalf())

# This fails
print("\nTest 2: Mul(Max(0, y), x, evaluate=False).evalf()")
print(Mul(Max(0, y), x, evaluate=False).evalf())
```

And this is the original output when running the test (before applying the patch):
## ORIGINAL OUTPUT
```
Test 1: Mul(x, Max(0, y), evaluate=False).evalf()
x*Max(0, y)

```

The repair agent has tried to generate a patch to fix the issue:
## PATCH CONTEXT
<PATCH_CONTEXT>
Here is the patch to address the `UnboundLocalError` in the `evalf` function by ensuring `NotImplementedError` is raised when `reprec` and `imprec` are not assigned:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/core/evalf.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            r = re, im, reprec, imprec\n=======\n            else:\n                raise NotImplementedError\n            r = re, im, reprec, imprec\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch adds an `else` clause to raise `NotImplementedError` before the assignment to `r`, ensuring that `reprec` and `imprec` are always correctly handled.
</PATCH_CONTEXT>

After applying the patch, the output of the test is:
## PATCHED OUTPUT

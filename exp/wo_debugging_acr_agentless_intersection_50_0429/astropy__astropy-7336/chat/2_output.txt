To resolve the issue with the `units.quantity_input` decorator in the `astropy` project, we need to examine the implementation of the decorator to identify how it handles return values. Specifically, we need to understand how the return type is checked and processed, as the issue arises from the attempt to call `.to()` on a `NoneType` object when the constructor has a return type hint of `-> None`.

Firstly, I will locate the source code for the `quantity_input` decorator to find out where the return value processing occurs in order to apply any necessary checks for `None`.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("quantity_input")
```
This will help us understand how quantity input is being processed and where the issue might be occurring.

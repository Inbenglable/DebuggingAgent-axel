The patch modifies three lines in the `matplotlib/colors.py` file by explicitly casting the replacement values to `np.uint8`. The casting ensures that the values `self._i_over`, `self._i_under`, and `self._i_bad` are correctly converted and handled as `np.uint8` types to avoid the deprecation warnings raised by NumPy.

However, when reviewing both the original and patched output, there are deprecation warnings related to the conversion of out-of-bound integers when calling `cmap(np.array([256, 257, 258], dtype=np.uint8))` within the test script. These warnings appear both before and after applying the patch, indicating that the patch did not resolve the deprecation warnings in the output of the test run.

Therefore, based on the test results, the patch applied did not fix the issue because the problem persisted in the output:

Issue resolved: `False`

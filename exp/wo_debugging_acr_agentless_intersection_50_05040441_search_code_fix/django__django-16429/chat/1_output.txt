To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code for the `timesince` function in the `timesince.py` file because I need to check how the pivot datetime object is instantiated and ensure it respects the timezone information.

I'll proceed to search for the `timesince` function in its corresponding file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/utils/timesince.py", "timesince")
```

To generate a patch, I need to gather more information about how column constraints, specifically UNIQUE constraints, are handled during table alterations in the SQLite backend. In particular, I need to see if there's any special handling for columns with UNIQUE constraints when they are added to a table using the `_remake_table` method in the SQLiteSchemaEditor class.

Let's retrieve the source code for `_remake_table` in the SQLiteSchemaEditor class.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py", "SQLiteSchemaEditor._remake_table")
```

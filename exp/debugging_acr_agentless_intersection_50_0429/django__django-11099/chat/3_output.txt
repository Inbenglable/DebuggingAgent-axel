To generate the patch, I need to modify the `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator`. I will need to retrieve the relevant source code for these validators to update the regex patterns. I'll proceed by searching for these two validators in the Django codebase to understand their implementation.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ASCIIUsernameValidator")
search_class_in_codebase("UnicodeUsernameValidator")
```

Based on the observations and the behavior of the `diophantine` function with differing outputs depending on the order of the symbols, we can summarize the following key points:

1. **Output Discrepancy**:
   - When invoked with `syms=(m, n)`, the output contains permutations with all possible sign flips, indicating that the permutation logic to handle both symbol position and sign flipping is executed as expected.
   - Conversely, calling with `syms=(n, m)` results in incomplete outcomes, suggesting the permutation logic is either bypassed or misinterpreted in this scenario.

2. **Logical Inconsistency**:
   - The core functionality seems to revolve around the permutation logic housed between lines 206 and 350. Particularly, the logic involving permutation checks and the subsequent handling (specifically `permute_signs`, `permute_signs_var`, and `permute_few_signs`) is critical here.
   - The observed method `diophantine` contains intricate configuration conditions that enable permutations, and likely these conditions may not be evaluated consistently when the order of symbols in `syms` changes, impacting the path taken through the method.

Given the discrepancy in behavior due to the symbols' order, the issue is likely localized around how permutations are applied or solutions are mapped back to symbols. The adaptations facilitated by `dict_sym_index` and their effect on result consistency should be especially scrutinized.

### Next Steps:
To further investigate, it will be prudent to examine how the symbol order impacts result construction. Specifically, observing how permutations and solution ordering is maintained post generation will assist in pinpointing why an inconsistency arises.

#### Observed scope:
Let's narrow our focus on conditions and adaptations driving permutations to ensure the function's multi-symbol adaptability works correctly. 

Observed scope: `sympy/solvers/diophantine.py:206-351`

Understanding interactions within these lines will provide insight into adjustments necessary for achieving consistent results irrespective of symbol order in the equation.

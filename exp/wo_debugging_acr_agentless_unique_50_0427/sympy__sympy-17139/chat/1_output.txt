To address the issue with `simplify(cos(x)**I)` causing an "Invalid comparison of complex I" error, we need to focus on the specific section of code where the error originates. Based on the traceback, the problematic code is located in the `fu.py` file, specifically within the `_f` function at line 504 in the `fu.py` file. 

Before generating a patch, we must examine the source code of the `_f` method to understand its logic and how the comparison is currently being handled. This will help us determine the necessary adjustments to prevent the TypeError when comparing complex numbers.

Let's retrieve the source code for the `_f` method within `fu.py`.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/simplify/fu.py", "_f")
```

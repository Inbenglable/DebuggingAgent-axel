To resolve this issue in the SymPy project, I need to identify the source of the problem, which seems to be related to the equality comparison behavior involving `S.false` and possibly floating-point zero represented by `S(0.0)`. To generate an effective patch, I need to understand how equality comparisons (`__eq__` method) are implemented in the SymPy `S` object or class and how `S.false` is defined. 

Since the issue seems to be related to the behavior of equality operators in this context, I would first investigate if there's a specific class or type handling these specific instances and operations. 

Let's start by searching for relevant methods that might be involved in the equality comparison involving `S.false`.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("__eq__")
search_class_in_codebase("S")
search_method_in_codebase("false")
```

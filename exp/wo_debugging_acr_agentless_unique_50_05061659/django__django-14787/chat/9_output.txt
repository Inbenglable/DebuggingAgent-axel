Upon reviewing the patch and analyzing the test outputs before and after applying the patch, we observe the following:

1. **Original Output**:
   - The test throws an `AttributeError` stating that `'functools.partial' object has no attribute '__name__'`.

2. **Patch Context**:
   - The patch attempts to address this issue by using `wraps` on the original function inside the `functools.partial` object to preserve its attributes.

3. **Patched Output**:
   - After applying the patch, the test output remains the same. It continues to throw `AttributeError`, indicating that the patch did not resolve the issue.

Based on this review, the problem with the `method_decorator` not preserving the function attributes when using partial objects has not been fixed by the proposed patch, as the error persists.

Issue resolved: `False`

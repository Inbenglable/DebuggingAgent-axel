To resolve the issue of adding DISTINCT support for Avg and Sum aggregates, I need to examine the relevant classes and methods that handle these aggregates in the Django codebase. Specifically, I'll need to look into where the Avg and Sum aggregates are defined and how they handle the DISTINCT parameter.

I'll start by searching for the classes and methods related to these aggregates.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Avg")
search_class_in_codebase("Sum")
```

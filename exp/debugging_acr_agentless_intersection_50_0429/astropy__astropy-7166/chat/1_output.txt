The issue at hand revolves around the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass in the **astropy** project, which is failing to inherit docstrings for properties. As outlined in the provided trace logs, the problem specifically arises with `inspect.isfunction` returning `False` for property objects, thus bypassing the logic intended for docstring inheritance in the metaclass's `__init__` method.

To identify the source of the problem, we should focus on the `__init__` method of the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass. In this method, there is a loop iterating over class attributes and checking if they are functions using `inspect.isfunction(val)`. This check excludes properties as they aren't considered functions by `inspect.isfunction`.

Considering the task is to address the issue where property docstrings aren't inherited, this is the starting diagnostic point. We need to modify the logic so it also considers properties when applying the docstring inheritance.

Therefore, I will now proceed to inspect the implementation of the `__init__` method of the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass to precisely identify the section that requires modification.

Observed method: `astropy/utils/misc.py:InheritDocstrings.__init__`

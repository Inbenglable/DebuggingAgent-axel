To address the issue of adding DISTINCT support for `Avg` and `Sum` aggregates in Django, we'll need to modify the respective classes to include an `allow_distinct` attribute, similar to its usage in the `Count` class.

Here's how the necessary patch would look in the *SEARCH/REPLACE* format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):\n    function = 'AVG'\n    name = 'Avg'\n=======\nclass Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):\n    function = 'AVG'\n    name = 'Avg'\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):\n    function = 'SUM'\n    name = 'Sum'\n=======\nclass Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):\n    function = 'SUM'\n    name = 'Sum'\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

These changes add the `allow_distinct = True` attribute to both the `Avg` and `Sum` classes, enabling them to support DISTINCT functionality similar to that of the `Count` class.

The current observed method is `_separable`, which is part of the Astropy library's separability handling for models. Based on the observation, `_separable` is meant to compute the separability of the outputs for a given transform (model).

### Analysis of Current Observation:

1. **Compound Model Handling:**
   - The method `_separable` is first called with `nested_cm`, which is a CompoundModel created from `Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm`.
   - The separability matrix is determined via the calculation for `Pix2Sky_TAN()` and `cm` separately.
  
2. **Expected vs. Actual Behavior:**
   - The expected result is that the nested compound model `nested_cm` maintains a certain separability, where there should be separability between transformations, but the computed result deviates (`True` where `False` was expected and vice versa).

3. **Observations and Runtime Analysis:**
   - The `_separable` method attempts to compute a compound combination via `_operators[transform.op](sepleft, sepright)`.
   - When observing the matrix manipulations for these compound models, it appears the operation isn't yielding the correct separability matrices when nested models involve derivatives or non-linear operations like `Pix2Sky_TAN`. The actual separability requires finer controls between left and right model operations.

### Conclusion:
The buggy part likely resides in how `_operators[...]` combine separability information from left and right models within compound models. Additional tracing is needed to confirm if this call is behaving as expected, especially `_operators[transform.op]`.

### Next Observation:
To further trace and verify our hypothesis, observe the method handling the operation application, which corresponds to:

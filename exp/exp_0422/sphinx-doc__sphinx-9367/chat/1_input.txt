You are a debugging agent tasked with precisely using tools to resolve issues and submit pull requests.

**Current Task:**  
Resolve the following issue in the sphinx project:
#### ISSUE
1-element tuple rendered incorrectly
**Describe the bug**
This is a followup to #7964 which has been addressed in #8265.

However the special case of a 1-element tuple is still not handled correctly.

`(1,)` is rendered as `(1)`, but should keep the trailing comma.

**To Reproduce**
Add a testcase
```
    ("(1,)", "(1,)"),                           # Tuple (single element)
```
at https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/blob/e0b1e1002b500acc63dfd0806f8095dd6b27037b/tests/test_pycode_ast.py#L57




Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:

from sphinx.pycode import ast

# Test single-element tuple
source = "(1,)"
module = ast.parse(source)
result = ast.unparse(module.body[0].value, source)
print(f"Input: {source}")
print(f"Output: {result}")
print(f"Expected: {source}")
print(f"Matches expected? {result == source}")

**Test Execution Results:**

Input: (1,)
Output: (1)
Expected: (1,)
Matches expected? False


Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

1. Create a minimal debugging test based on the reproduce test.
2. Debug by reviewing the relevant source code and monitoring runtime information.
3. Once you have identified the root cause, modify the code with minimal changes.
4. Rerun the reproduction script to confirm that the issue is fixed.

Focus on Step 1: generate a debugging test. At the end of your analysis, provide the specific code in the following **JSON format**.
Note: You should clearly specify the tests you are debugging as much as possible. Minimizing the amount of code will better assist you in analyzing runtime information later.

"debugging_test" : "import ... # Your debugging test code here"

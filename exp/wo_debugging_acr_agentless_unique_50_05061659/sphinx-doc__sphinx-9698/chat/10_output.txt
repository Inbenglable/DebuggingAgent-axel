Upon reviewing the patch and analyzing the test outputs before and after applying the patch, it becomes clear that the issue is not resolved.

### Analysis:

#### Test Output Before Patch:
- The test failed with the error, "Index entry for 'Foo.bar' not found".
- This indicates that the `Foo.bar` entry was missing in the index.

#### Patch:
- The patch modifies the `get_index_text` method in the `PyProperty` class to change the format from `'%s (%s property)'` to `'%s %s property'`.
- This change is intended to remove parentheses from property entries in the index.

#### Test Output After Patch:
- The test again failed with the same error: "Index entry for 'Foo.bar' not found".
- This indicates that the patch did not resolve the issue because the index is still missing the `Foo.bar` entry.

The issue stated that an index entry with parentheses was registered for `py:method` directive with `:property:` option. However, the problem seems to be that the index entry is entirely missing, rather than the format being incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The patch did not resolve the issue as the root cause of the missing index entry was not addressed.

Issue resolved: `False`

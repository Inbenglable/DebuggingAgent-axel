To resolve the issue identified with the `trim_docstring` function in the Django codebase, I'll modify the function to correctly handle first-line indentation in docstrings. The change involves skipping the first line when calculating the minimum indentation. Here's the patch to address the issue:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())\n=======\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
``` 

This patch will ensure the `trim_docstring` function correctly processes docstrings where the text begins on the first line.

## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Use proper whitespace in CREATE INDEX statements
Description
	 
		(last modified by Hannes Ljungberg)
	 
Creating an index through:
index = Index(
	fields=['-name’],
	name='idx'
)
Will generate the valid but not so pretty CREATE INDEX statement: 
CREATE INDEX "idx" ON "schema_author" ("name"DESC)
The following would be expected:
CREATE INDEX "idx" ON "schema_author" ("name" DESC)
This was partially fixed for indexes using opclasses in https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/30903#ticket but it introduced a new quirk when opclasses is used without explicit ordering:
index = Index(
	fields=['name’],
	name='idx'
	opclasses=['text_pattern_ops’]
)
Will result in:
CREATE INDEX "idx" ON "schema_author" (“name” text_pattern_ops )
Note the whitespace after text_pattern_ops. When used with a descending order it will look correct. 
Unfortunately in the fix in #30903 it was assumed that the col_suffixes passed to django.db.backends.ddl_references.Columns would be empty for ascending order but instead it will contain empty strings and thus causing this bug. See: ​https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/db/backends/ddl_references.py#L87
The expected output would be:
CREATE INDEX "idx" ON "schema_author" (“name” text_pattern_ops)

This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
The error output indicates that the script is attempting to import `AddIndex` from `django.db.migrations.operations.indexes`, but it encounters a `ModuleNotFoundError` because the specified module does not exist. In Django, index operations are typically handled through other mechanisms rather than inside this specific path. This suggests that the referencing might be incorrect or outdated.

Additionally, examining the given test script, it's clear that the intended functionality is to validate the SQL generation for creating database indexes, including the formatting and whitespace issues raised in the issue description. The script, however, fails right at the beginning before anything meaningful in terms of testing could be executed.

Steps for resolution:
1. Verify the import paths and adjust them to the correct module if they have changed in recent Django versions. For instance, index operations for migrations are handled differently, and finding their correct path is critical.
2. We need to identify where the SQL generation for indexes is handled in Django’s codebase to be able to trace the root of the incorrect whitespace formatting.

Based on the error message and context, the immediate next step is to ensure the correct module is identified where index operations are addressed or generated in Django as the current file is inconsistent with Django's known structure.

Observed method: `django/db/backends/base/schema.py:BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor._create_index_sql`
==================================================
The issue with the SQL generation for creating indexes with proper whitespace was being observed with the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor._create_index_sql` method. The key part of this method responsible for handling the index generation is the line:

```python
columns=self._index_columns(table, columns, col_suffixes, opclasses)
```

This line calls another internal utility to format the columns for the SQL statement, which seems pertinent to why the whitespace is not generated correctly, particularly around suffixes and opclasses.

Given the issue in the runtime trace showing import errors, there is evidence of a misalignment with how modules are structured in the test environment. To resolve the SQL formatting issue, the logic mainly lies in how `_index_columns` processes the column suffixes, including opclasses and ordering indications.

The incorrect whitespace primarily comes from how these components are concatenated without a space when converting them into the SQL string representation.

To debug the whitespace issues specifically, I need to look further into the `_index_columns` method or potentially another utility it may call that handles the formatting of the SQL statement parts.

**Next Step:**

I will observe the code that deals directly with formatting of the index-related SQL generation components—specifically, the section where the logic for combining column names and associated suffixes (`col_suffixes`) is implemented, as they appear in `_create_index_sql`.

Observed scope: `django/db/backends/base/schema.py:953-971`
==================================================
Based on the provided information and the runtime error, the observed code snippet in `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor._create_index_sql` references a method `_index_columns`, which appears to be integral to constructing the SQL for creating an index. This part of the method is called out as potentially mishandling column suffixes that include opclasses and order indicators—leading to the whitespace issues described in the original issue report.

The execution trace indicates a problem early in the program due to a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the `AddIndex` import, which halts the test before any SQL generation can occur. However, the existing analysis has specified the following points:
- The key method for SQL generation is `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor._create_index_sql`, particularly the call to `self._index_columns`.

The issue likely resides within the `_index_columns` method or yet another lower-level utility it calls to properly join column names and their suffixes with correct spacing. Therefore, the next logical step would be to trace what is happening inside `_index_columns` as it processes suffixes and opclasses.

Observed method: `django/db/backends/base/schema.py:BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor._index_columns`
==================================================
The observed method `_index_columns` seems to be responsible for constructing how table columns are represented in SQL statements, specifically when generating a SQL statement for creating an index. This method calls the `Columns` class with several parameters, including `col_suffixes` and `opclasses`, which are likely responsible for appending order indicators and operational classes to column names. 

Considering the runtime information and the given task to fix the whitespace issues in the index creation SQL, the problematic area likely stems from the inability of `_index_columns` or the `Columns` class it invokes to correctly handle and format these suffixes and opclasses when creating the SQL string. The whitespace anomaly arises particularly when opclasses are used without explicit ordering.

However, to effectively locate the buggy method or code, we need further details on the `Columns` class implementation called within `_index_columns`, as this class seems to be directly responsible for column formatting.

Therefore, the next step is to observe how the `Columns` class processes the given `col_suffixes` and `opclasses`, which appears to be directly involved in creating malformed SQL strings.

Observed scope: `django/db/backends/ddl_references.py:87-107`
==================================================
The current issue pertains to the whitespace formatting in the SQL statements generated by Django's index creation logic. This is particularly focused on incorrect handling of column suffixes and opclasses, as noted in the test cases and issue description. 

### Analysis of the Current Observed Code:
The observed code snippet is from the `IndexColumns` class within `ddl_references.py`. This class inherits from `Columns`, and it appears to play a role in specifying or formatting how columns are included in SQL statements when creating indexes.

The `__init__` method of `IndexColumns` is shown, but the completion of this method or any relevant logic thereafter isn't visible here. However, this method accepts parameters such as `col_suffixes` and `opclasses`. Thus, while this snippet itself doesn't show any specific string handling or formatting, the received parameters suggest that this is indeed the point where column details, including suffixes and opclasses, need careful string concatenation to ensure correct SQL formation.

The traceback also indicates an import error for `AddIndex`, which prevents the test script from executing properly. This points to structural inconsistencies in the test environment setup.

### Based on the Observed Code and Context:

Since this part of the code doesn't yet directly show string handling or concatenation regarding the actual SQL generation, the next logical step would be to examine how `IndexColumns` interacts with its base `Columns` class for more concrete evidence of SQL string construction.

### Next Step:

Given the direct involvement of `IndexColumns` and its `col_suffixes`, I will proceed to observe how the `Columns` class processes these attributes.

**Observed method: `django/db/backends/ddl_references.py:Columns.__init__`**
==================================================
Based on the observed code and runtime information:

### Analysis:

1. **Current Code Analysis**:
   - In the `Columns.__init__` method, `col_suffixes` are passed as a parameter and stored as an attribute. However, there is no immediate logic within the constructor showing how these suffixes are concatenated or formatted as part of SQL generation.
   - The observed method, `__init__`, acts solely to initialize properties without modifying them.

2. **Runtime Information**:
   - The runtime traceback indicates an import error for `AddIndex`, preventing further execution. This suggests an environmental setup issue, requiring adjustment of import paths for Django modules if those have changed.
   - Import issues block the test script before SQL-related methods can be executed, where the SQL string formatting problem would manifest.

3. **Traceback Context**:
   - There is a consistent problem with improper spacing for `col_suffixes` and `opclasses` in generated SQL across the issue description and test cases.
   - The problems likely happen in how subsequent methods, outside of initialization, concatenate these suffix values into an SQL string—particularly when `Columns` instances are used.

### Next Steps:
- The issue's root cause likely resides further in how `Columns` instances are used to generate SQL strings. The `__init__` method does not provide enough context on formatting.
- Observing downstream logic where `col_suffixes` are concatenated to generate SQL might reveal the spot that incorrectly handles whitespace.

Given this, the next step is to observe the scope where `Columns` class instances are used to generate SQL strings, specifically focusing near their formatting logic.

### Request for Further Observation:
I will proceed to observe more code downstream in relation to `Columns` where string formatting is demonstrated.

**Observed scope**: `django/db/backends/ddl_references.py:108-130`

To address the issue, it's important to gather more information about how the `AlterUniqueTogether` and `AlterIndexTogether` operations are applied and whether they involve any logic that might prevent simple merging. Specifically, we'll need to examine the methods within the `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` class that are responsible for changes to these model options. These methods could override logic for migration operations and may prevent a straightforward merge.

Thus, we need to retrieve the source code for the following:
1. The `state_forwards` method, as it is responsible for applying the operation to the migrations state.
2. Potentially the `database_forwards` method, to understand how operations are applied to the database.

We need to locate these methods within the `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` class in the `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/operations/models.py", "state_forwards")
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/operations/models.py", "database_forwards")
```

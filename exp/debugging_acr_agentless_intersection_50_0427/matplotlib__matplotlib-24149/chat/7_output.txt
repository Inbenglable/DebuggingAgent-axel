To determine if the issue has been resolved, let's analyze the provided information:

### Patch Analysis
1. **Patch Changes**:
   - The patch modifies the `Axes._convert_dx` method in `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py`.
   - It adds handling for the `StopIteration` exception in two try-except blocks.
   - When `StopIteration` is caught, `x0` and `x` are set to `np.nan`, which should allow the method to handle all-NaN data without raising an exception.

### Test Output Analysis
1. **Original Output**:
   - The original output shows a `StopIteration` error when attempting to plot a bar with NaN values. This error is identified in the traceback related to `cbook._safe_first_finite`.

2. **Patched Output**:
   - After applying the patch, the original `StopIteration` error is no longer present. However, there is still a warning unrelated to this issue, about processing a `.pth` file, which doesn't appear to affect the plot functionality.
   - Importantly, there is no traceback error related to the `ax.bar` plotting of NaN values, suggesting the crash due to NaN values has been addressed.

### Conclusion
The patched output no longer shows the `StopIteration` error, indicating that the code now handles NaN values appropriately, thereby fixing the issue in question.

Issue resolved: `True`

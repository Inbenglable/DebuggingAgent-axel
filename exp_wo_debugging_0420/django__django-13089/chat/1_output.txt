To address the reported issue, I need to investigate the `_cull` method implementation in the given file `django/core/cache/backends/db.py`. Specifically, I want to ensure the exact lines mentioned in the issue are retrieved to check how the `cursor` and its returned results are handled. This will help me properly identify the fix and make an adjustment if the cursor result is `None`.

I'll proceed to search for the `_cull` method in the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/cache/backends/db.py", "_cull")
```

Reviewing the patch and test setup, it is evident that the underlying issue with the `order_by('?')` affecting the `GROUP BY` clause was addressed by modifying the logic in the `get_group_by` function to exclude `Random` expressions from impacting the `GROUP BY` clause.

However, the test outputs both before and after applying the patch indicate that the tests do not execute successfully due to an `AppRegistryNotReady` exception. This exception suggests that the Django application registry is not properly set up before the models are defined in the testing environment. This means that the tests are unable to run, and therefore cannot validate whether the patch effectively resolves the problem described in the issue.

For the test to run successfully and validate the fix, the Django apps need to be properly initialized before defining the models. This involves calling `django.setup()` after configuring settings to ensure the application registry is ready, fixing the `AppRegistryNotReady` error.

Since the tests could not be executed, we cannot determine through testing whether the patch resolves the reported issue. Therefore, based solely on the success of the test execution:

Issue resolved: `False`

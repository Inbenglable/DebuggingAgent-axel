The issue is that the `Dataset.merge` method expects the `other` parameter to be something coercible to a `Dataset` or `CoercibleMapping`. However, a `DataArray` is being passed which isn't directly handled by `dataset_merge_method` which uses the `items` method internally.

The solution is to modify the `merge` method to wrap `DataArray` into a `Dataset` before proceeding with the merge logic.

Before implementing this fix, let's double-check if there are existing utilities in the code that already handle the wrapping of `DataArray` into a `Dataset`, or if a small utility function should be introduced.

Therefore, I'll search for existing utilities or methods that could assist in this operation.

```python
search_method_in_file("xarray/core/dataarray.py", "DataArray.to_dataset")
```

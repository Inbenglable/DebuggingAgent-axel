The patch aimed to introduce an `__iter__` method in the `Paginator` class to make it iterable. However, the process failed due to a syntax error, leading to an `IndentationError`.

Here is the analysis of the steps:

1. **Original Issue**: The original issue was that the `Paginator` class was not iterable, indicated by the `TypeError: 'MockPaginator' object is not iterable`.

2. **Patch Details**: The patch attempted to add an `__iter__` method to the `Paginator` class. The code for this was intended to replace part of the file `django/core/paginator.py`.

3. **Patched Output**: After applying the patch, the test resulted in an `IndentationError`, suggesting that the insertion of the `__iter__` method in the file was not correctly aligned or integrated into the class definition.

This error suggests that the patch was not correctly applied due to indentation issues, and hence, the original issue of making the `Paginator` iterable was not resolved.

**Issue resolved: False**

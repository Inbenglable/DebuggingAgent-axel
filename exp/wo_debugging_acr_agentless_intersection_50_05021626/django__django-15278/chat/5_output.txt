In order to generate the patch, I need to acquire the complete implementation details around the `_remake_table` method which is used in the `add_field` method of the `SQLiteSchemaEditor`. This appears to play a significant role in handling the addition of fields, especially when a nullable field or a field with default values is involved. Understanding how `_remake_table` operates could offer insights or potential areas for modification to address the unique constraint issue.

Therefore, I'll search for the `_remake_table` method within `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py`.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py", "_remake_table")
```

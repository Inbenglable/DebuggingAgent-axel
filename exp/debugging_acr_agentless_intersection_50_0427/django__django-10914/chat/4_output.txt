The issue at hand involves inconsistent file permissions when files are uploaded using Django's `FileSystemStorage`. The problematic behavior stems from the use of `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` for large file uploads, which results in the file permissions being set to `0o600` instead of the desired `0o644`. 

Currently, we've traced the `Storage.save` method, which calls the `_save` method of `FileSystemStorage`. The runtime information indicates that the assertion fails for `TemporaryUploadedFile`, as the permissions are `0o600` instead of `0o644`.

Since the permissions inconsistency occurs specifically during the file save operation, it's logical to investigate the underlying `_save` method, as that's where the file writing and permission setting are likely handled.

To pinpoint the offending code, I will need to observe the behavior of the `_save` method in more detail.

Observed scope: `django/core/files/storage.py:53-80`

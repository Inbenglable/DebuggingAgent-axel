To resolve the issue, I need to modify the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` class by setting the `disabled` attribute to `True`. Before making these changes, I need to retrieve the complete source code of the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` class to ensure the modification is properly integrated within its context.

I'll retrieve the full class code from `django/contrib/auth/forms.py`.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/contrib/auth/forms.py", "ReadOnlyPasswordHashField")
```

Upon reviewing the patch and analyzing the test output before and after the patch, here's the assessment:

### Patch Review:
- The patch modifies the line in `django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py`.
- It adds an additional condition `and has_add_permission` to the line checking `show_save_as_new`.
- This aligns with the issue description, which suggests that the "save as new" functionality should require both change and add permissions.

### Test Output Analysis:
- **Original Output** (before applying the patch):
  - **Test Case 1**: Fails because "Save as new" is incorrectly shown without add permission.
  - **Test Case 2**: Passes, indicating correct behavior when the user has both change and add permissions.
  - **Test Case 3**: Passes, indicating correct behavior when `save_as` is False.

- **Patched Output** (after applying the patch):
  - **Test Case 1**: Passes, indicating the issue of showing "Save as new" without add permission is resolved.
  - **Test Case 2**: Continues to pass, indicating consistency in behavior when both permissions are available.
  - **Test Case 3**: Continues to pass, showing that disabling save_as correctly hides "Save as new".

### Conclusion:
Based on the patched output, all test cases now behave correctly as per the requirements specified in the issue description. Therefore, the issue is resolved with the applied patch.

Issue resolved: `True`

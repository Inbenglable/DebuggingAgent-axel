To resolve the `IndexError` caused by invalid list deletions in the `minimal_blocks` method, we need to ensure that list access and deletions are safeguarded. Specifically, before attempting to delete elements from `num_blocks` and `blocks`, we should verify that `i` is within the valid range of the lists.

Here is the patch to fix this issue:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/combinatorics/perm_groups.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                        del num_blocks[i], blocks[i]\n=======\n                        if i < len(num_blocks) and i < len(blocks):\n                            del num_blocks[i], blocks[i]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch checks that `i` is a valid index for both `num_blocks` and `blocks` before attempting to perform the delete operation. This should prevent the `IndexError` without altering the intended logic of the function.

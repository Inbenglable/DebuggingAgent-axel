To determine whether the issue is resolved, let's analyze the provided data.

### Patch Analysis:
The patch attempts to address the issue by:
1. Removing the `ValueError` that is raised for repeated elements, which were causing an error when non-disjoint cycles are introduced.
2. Modifying the handling of cycles by introducing a temporary `Cycle` object and attempting to apply it in sequence.

### Test Output Analysis:
#### Original Output:
- The test fails with a `ValueError` indicating that repeated elements in non-disjoint cycles are not handled correctly.
- This matches the reported issue where `Permutation([[0, 1], [0, 1]])` results in a `ValueError`.

#### Patched Output:
- The test encounters an `AttributeError`, specifically: `AttributeError: 'Cycle' object has no attribute 'array_form'`.
- This indicates a new problem introduced by the patch. The `Cycle` object apparently does not possess an `array_form` attribute, leading to a failure when attempting to construct a permutation from cycle elements.

### Conclusion:
The patch aimed to fix the original problem of handling non-disjoint cycles but introduced a new error due to the incorrect handling of the `Cycle` object. The original issue of constructing the identity permutation from non-disjoint cycles is not resolved and furthermore, a new bug (an `AttributeError`) has been introduced.

Therefore, the issue is not resolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

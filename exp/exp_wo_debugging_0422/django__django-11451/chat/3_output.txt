Here is the patch to resolve the issue by preventing unnecessary database queries when `username` or `password` is `None`:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/auth/backends.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if username is None:\n            username = kwargs.get(UserModel.USERNAME_FIELD)\n        try:\n            user = UserModel._default_manager.get_by_natural_key(username)\n=======\n        if username is None or password is None:\n            return\n        try:\n            user = UserModel._default_manager.get_by_natural_key(username)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch ensures that if either `username` or `password` is `None`, the `authenticate` method will exit immediately, which will avoid unnecessary database queries and password hashing operations.

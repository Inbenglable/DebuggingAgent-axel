I need to retrieve the source code for the `__init__` method of the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` class in order to modify it and set the `disabled` attribute to `True` by default. Let's proceed with fetching the `__init__` method implementation.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/auth/forms.py", "ReadOnlyPasswordHashField.__init__")
```

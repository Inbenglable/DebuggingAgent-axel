To determine whether the issue is resolved, let's analyze both the patch and the test outputs first.

### Patch Analysis
The patch changes the assignment of `opts` from using `cur_model._meta` to `cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta` in the file `django/db/models/sql/query.py`. This change is specifically meant to address the issue of handling proxy models in Django when using `QuerySet.only()` after `select_related()`.

### Original Output
The original output shows an error related to the absence of a module named 'your_project', indicating an environment setup issue rather than the actual problem highlighted in the bug description.

### Patched Output
The output after the patch exhibits the same error as the original output: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'your_project'`. This indicates that the test setup is incorrect, as the necessary Django project and modules are missing.

### Conclusion
Neither the original nor the patched test provides insight into whether the specific bug related to proxy models has been resolved because the test execution fails due to an environment setup issue. Therefore, without proper test execution, it's impossible to conclusively say if the patch resolves the actual problem described in the issue.

Issue resolved: `False`

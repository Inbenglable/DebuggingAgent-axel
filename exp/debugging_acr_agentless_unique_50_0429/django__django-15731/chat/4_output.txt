Based on the provided information, the primary issue with the initial setup code in the provided test script is indeed related to the ordering of the execution. 

The error `django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured` suggests that the Django settings are not being initialized before the definition of the `Person` model class. Therefore, the `setup_django()` function must be called immediately after importing necessary modules and before defining any models.

However, the core issue to be resolved lies within the Django Manager's method decorator problem, particularly how metadata such as function signature is not being correctly attached to methods following decoration. 

Given the original issue context, the `django/db/models/manager.py` file needs to be examined, particularly around the use of decorators on queryset methods. The issue is related to using `inspect.signature()` and the expected fix as suggested is to replace manual metadata assignment with the use of `functools.wraps`.

Going step by step, the original issue relates to:

The current abnormal behavior:
- The incorrect signature information due to manual assignment of name and docstring not fully capturing function metadata.

Based on the problem in the `django` project and the initial setup issue being external to the actual bug:

Buggy method (based on issue description): `django/db/models/manager.py:create_method`

The description of the issue precisely indicates that the lines manually assigning metadata in the `create_method` (or related method where a similar operation occurs for manager/queryset methods) need to be replaced with `functools.wraps` for appropriate metadata propagation, aligning signature, and documentation correctly. This involves examining wherever the function decorators are applied in `manager.py` or related files. 

Let's focus on the specific corrective measures for the metadata misassignment using `functools.wraps` within `django/db/models/manager.py`. If further confirmation or more exact line details are needed, observing the decorators or similar assignments in that file is essential. Would you like to examine further around decorators in the file, given the insight from the issue description?

To resolve the issue regarding the `_check_homomorphism` method in the `sympy` project, I'll first need to retrieve the source code of the `_image()` function related to PermutationGroups since this is where the error is occurring and where there's potential for simplification. 

Therefore, I'll proceed to search for the `_image()` method in the relevant part of the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("_image")
```

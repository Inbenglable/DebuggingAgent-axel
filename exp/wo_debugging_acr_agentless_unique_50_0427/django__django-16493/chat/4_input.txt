## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Callable storage on FileField fails to deconstruct when it returns default_storage
Description
	
If the storage argument on a FileField is set to a callable that returns default_storage, it is omitted from the deconstructed form of the field, rather than being included as a reference to the callable as expected.
For example, given a model definition:
from django.core.files.storage import FileSystemStorage, default_storage
from django.db import models
import random
other_storage = FileSystemStorage(location='/media/other')
def get_storage():
	return random.choice([default_storage, other_storage])
class MyModel(models.Model):
	my_file = models.FileField(storage=get_storage)
repeatedly running makemigrations will randomly generate a migration that alternately includes or omits storage=myapp.models.get_storage on the FileField definition.
This case was overlooked in the fix for #31941 - the deconstruct method tests if self.storage is not default_storage to determine whether to add the storage kwarg, but at this point self.storage is the evaluated version, so it wrongly returns false for a callable that returns default_storage.

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve this issue, I need to make sure I understand how the `deconstruct` method is implemented for the `FileField`. The problem lies in how this method decides whether to include the `storage` argument when the storage is callable and can potentially return `default_storage`.

Since I need to understand the implementation of `deconstruct` for the `FileField`, I will search for this method and review its logic.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("FileField.deconstruct")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("FileField.deconstruct")
RESULT:
#### django/db/models/fields/files.py:FileField.deconstruct
```python
    def deconstruct(self):
        name, path, args, kwargs = super().deconstruct()
        if kwargs.get("max_length") == 100:
            del kwargs["max_length"]
        kwargs["upload_to"] = self.upload_to
        if self.storage is not default_storage:
            kwargs["storage"] = getattr(self, "_storage_callable", self.storage)
        return name, path, args, kwargs

```


==================================================

Your Output:
To resolve the issue, I need to inspect the `FileField` class implementation to understand how the `deconstruct` method interacts with other aspects of the class, especially regarding how it manages the `storage` attribute and callable objects. This will help determine the best fix for ensuring that callables returning `default_storage` can be deconstructed correctly.

Thus, I'll proceed to retrieve the implementation of the `FileField` class in the `django/db/models/fields/files.py` file to see its entirety and how it interacts with the `storage` attribute.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/fields/files.py", "FileField")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_class_in_file("django/db/models/fields/files.py", "FileField")
RESULT:
#### django/db/models/fields/files.py:FileField
```python
class FileField(Field):

    # The class to wrap instance attributes in. Accessing the file object off
    # the instance will always return an instance of attr_class.
    attr_class = FieldFile

    # The descriptor to use for accessing the attribute off of the class.
    descriptor_class = FileDescriptor

    description = _("File")

    def __init__(
        ...

    ):
        self._primary_key_set_explicitly = "primary_key" in kwargs

        self.storage = storage or default_storage
        if callable(self.storage):
            # Hold a reference to the callable for deconstruct().
            self._storage_callable = self.storage
            self.storage = self.storage()
            if not isinstance(self.storage, Storage):
                raise TypeError(
                    "%s.storage must be a subclass/instance of %s.%s"
                    % (

                    )
                )
        self.upload_to = upload_to

        kwargs.setdefault("max_length", 100)

==================================================

Your Output:
Based on the information retrieved, especially the `FileField` class and its `deconstruct` method, I have sufficient details to understand how the storage callable is managed. I can proceed with generating the patch to ensure that callables returning `default_storage` are correctly deconstructed.

Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

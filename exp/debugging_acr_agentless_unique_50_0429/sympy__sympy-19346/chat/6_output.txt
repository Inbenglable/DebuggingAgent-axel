To resolve the issue, I need to obtain the source code for the `ReprPrinter._print` method, as this is where the improper handling of sets and dicts occurs. Additionally, I should ensure that this class or method can properly adapt to these types.

Let's start by retrieving the source code for the relevant method and potentially the class if additional context is needed.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/printer.py", "ReprPrinter._print")
search_class_in_file("sympy/printing/printer.py", "ReprPrinter")
```

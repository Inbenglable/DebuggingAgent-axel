Here's the patch to resolve the issue by replacing the current implementation of the `escape` function in `django/utils/html.py` with Python's standard library `html.escape` function:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/utils/html.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    return mark_safe(str(text).translate(_html_escapes))\n=======\n    from html import escape as html_escape\n    return mark_safe(html_escape(str(text)))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch ensures that the `escape` function utilizes the community-developed and faster `html.escape`, aligning its behavior with the Python standard library.

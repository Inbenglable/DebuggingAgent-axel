To resolve the issue with adding DISTINCT support for Avg and Sum aggregates in Django, I need to explore the source code related to these aggregate classes to understand how they manage the DISTINCT parameter. 

Typically, Django's aggregation methods and classes are located within the `django.db.models` area, specifically in files like `django/db/models/aggregates.py`. I need to search for the `Avg` and `Sum` classes and review their implementations.

Let's start by retrieving the source code for these classes:

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Avg")
search_class_in_codebase("Sum")
```

Once I have this information, I'll be able to determine how to address the issue of enabling DISTINCT support.

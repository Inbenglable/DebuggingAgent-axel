The issue arises when trying to unparse a single-element tuple `(1,)`, which is incorrectly rendered without the trailing comma as `(1)`.

### Analysis of Observed Behavior

1. **Input and Output**:
   - Input: `(1,)`
   - Expected Output: `(1,)`
   - Observed Output: `(1)`

2. **Issue Scope**:
   - The problem occurs in the `unparse` method, specifically with how tuples are handled.
   - The `unparse` method delegates the processing to `_UnparseVisitor.visit()`.

3. **Root Cause Hypothesis**:
   - The `_UnparseVisitor` class (or its specific methods for handling tuples) might not be correctly handling single-element tuples by omitting the necessary trailing comma.

### Next Steps
To locate the buggy code, we should investigate the `_UnparseVisitor` methods responsible for tuples. This will typically involve observing how tuples, especially single-element tuples, are processed.

Let's examine the `_UnparseVisitor` class and its relevant methods to understand where the behavior diverges:

Observed scope: `sphinx/pycode/ast.py:81-90` (assuming `_UnparseVisitor` is within this approximate range)

Here is the patch to resolve the issue with the `model_to_dict` function, ensuring it returns an empty dictionary when an empty list of fields is provided:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/forms/models.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if fields and f.name not in fields:\n=======\n        if fields is not None and f.name not in fields:\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

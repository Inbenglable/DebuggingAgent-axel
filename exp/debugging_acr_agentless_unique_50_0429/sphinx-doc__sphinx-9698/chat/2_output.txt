The observed error message indicates a `NameError` due to `sys` not being defined. This error occurs in the `debugging_test_execution_wrapper` function within the `src/run_debugging_test.py` script. When closely examining the provided test code, we can identify that this code snippet aims to test the Sphinx documentation build process, specifically checking index entries.

The observed error does not directly relate to the task of resolving the specific Sphinx issue mentioned in the `ISSUE`. However, it indicates a problem with executing the testing framework, as `sys` needs to be imported at the beginning of `debugging_test_execution_wrapper` to resolve the `NameError`.

Consequently, to move forward with addressing the actual Sphinx project issue, we need to ensure the test code can execute without runtime errors unrelated to the core logic. Thus, fixing the `NameError` would be a required preliminary step to use the testing framework effectively.

Given that my task is to trace abnormal program behavior related to the Sphinx issue, I need to focus on the Sphinx code handling index entries related to `py:method` directives with the `:property:` option that incorrectly adds parentheses.

To progress in tracing the issue, I need to observe related methods in the Sphinx codebase dealing with documentation domain directives that handle property formatting.

Observed method: `sphinx/domains/python.py:PyMethod.index()`

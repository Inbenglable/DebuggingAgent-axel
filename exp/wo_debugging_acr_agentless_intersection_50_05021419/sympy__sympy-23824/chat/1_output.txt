To resolve this issue, I need to review the source code of the `kahane_simplify()` function. The user's analysis suggests that the function incorrectly manages the order of leading gamma matrices after simplification. Therefore, it's crucial to retrieve the code for the `kahane_simplify()` function from the SymPy codebase to verify and correct its behavior. As the file path is not provided, I will search for the method within the entire codebase to locate its definition. 

```python
search_method_in_codebase("kahane_simplify")
```

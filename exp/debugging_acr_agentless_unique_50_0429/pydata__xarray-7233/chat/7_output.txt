The issue described is with the `ds.Coarsen.construct` method in the xarray project, where non-dimensional coordinates are demoted to variables. The given minimal complete verifiable example shows that before the patch, when calling `construct`, the `day` coordinate was incorrectly demoted to a variable, which is confirmed by the original output of the test.

The patch provided modifies the calculation of the `should_be_coords` set in the `xarray/core/rolling.py`. This change ensures that all original coordinates, including non-dimensional ones, are preserved after the coarsen operation by setting `should_be_coords` to include all keys from `self.obj.coords`.

The original output of the test shows an `AssertionError` indicating that the `day` coordinate was demoted to a variable as stated in the issue. After the patch is applied, the output indicates that the issue is fixed, as the `AssertionError` is no longer raised and the message "The issue is fixed." is printed.

Therefore, after reviewing the patch and the test output, it appears that the patch successfully fixes the issue by ensuring non-dimensional coordinates remain as coordinates after the `coarsen.construct` operation.

Issue resolved: `True`

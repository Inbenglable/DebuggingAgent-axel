To address the issue reported with the `HuberRegressor` fitting method in scikit-learn, I need to examine the source code of the method to identify where the conversion of boolean input to float should occur.

I will perform a search for the `fit` method in the `HuberRegressor` class. The class likely resides in a file related to linear models due to its nature.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("HuberRegressor")
search_method_in_file("sklearn/linear_model/_huber.py", "HuberRegressor.fit")
```

To fix the issue in the `kernS` function, we need to ensure that the variable `kern` is defined before it is potentially accessed. We can do this by initializing `kern` with a default value at the beginning of the function. Here's the patch to achieve that:

```pythony
### sympy/core/sympify.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    if '(' in s and not quoted:
=======
    kern = ''  # initialize kern
    if '(' in s and not quoted:
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, providing the edit result in JSON format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/core/sympify.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    if '(' in s and not quoted:\n=======\n    kern = ''  # initialize kern\n    if '(' in s and not quoted:\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

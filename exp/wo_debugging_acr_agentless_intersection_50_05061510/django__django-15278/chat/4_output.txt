I have gathered some information about how the `AddField` operation works and how the `SQLiteSchemaEditor.add_field` method is invoked. However, to understand if and how unique constraints are managed when adding fields in the SQLite backend, specifically when dealing with `OneToOneField`, more details on the `SQLiteSchemaEditor` class and its handling of unique constraints are required.

I need to further inspect the code in the `SQLiteSchemaEditor` class to understand how unique constraints are applied during field additions.

Let's proceed by searching for the complete implementation of the `SQLiteSchemaEditor` class to check for any intricate handling related to unique constraints.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py", "SQLiteSchemaEditor")
```

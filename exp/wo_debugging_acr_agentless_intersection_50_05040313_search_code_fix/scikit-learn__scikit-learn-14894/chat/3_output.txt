To ensure I create an appropriate solution, I need to examine the `libsvm_sparse.libsvm_sparse_train` method or function, as it's crucial for understanding how the `support_vectors_` attribute results could be empty and leads to division by zero. I need to check how it calculates the `dual_coef_data` and related attributes. Let me search for this method.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("libsvm_sparse.libsvm_sparse_train")
```

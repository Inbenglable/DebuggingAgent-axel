To address the issue involving Unicode string handling for HTTP method names in Python 2.7 in the `requests` library, we will modify the `prepare_method` function to explicitly convert the method name into an ASCII string.

Here is the patch to fix the problem:

```pythony
### requests/models.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
self.method = method
=======
self.method = str(method)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the HTTP method, irrespective of whether it is passed as a Unicode or string, is always converted to a standard string, preventing encoding issues in Python 2.7.

Now, let's format this change in the required JSON response:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### requests/models.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        self.method = method\n=======\n        self.method = str(method)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

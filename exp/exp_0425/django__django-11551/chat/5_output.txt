To generate a patch for the `_check_list_display_item` method in the `django/contrib/admin/checks.py` file, I need to obtain its source code to understand its current implementation, identify the problematic logic, and make necessary modifications. I will search for the method in the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/admin/checks.py", "ModelAdminChecks._check_list_display_item")
```

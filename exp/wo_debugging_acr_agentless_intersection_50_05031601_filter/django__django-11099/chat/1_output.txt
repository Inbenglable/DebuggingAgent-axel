To resolve the issue, I need to modify the regular expression patterns used by the `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator`. These validators are likely found in `django/contrib/auth/validators.py`. Hence, I need to retrieve the source code for the classes `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` to see where the regex pattern is defined and then adjust them.

Let's search for these classes in the file `django/contrib/auth/validators.py`.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/contrib/auth/validators.py", "ASCIIUsernameValidator")
search_class_in_file("django/contrib/auth/validators.py", "UnicodeUsernameValidator")
```

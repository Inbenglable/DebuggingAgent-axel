To fix the issue with `kern` being referenced before assignment in the `kernS` function, I will modify the code to ensure `kern` is initialized early in the process, before its potential reference. The change will maintain existing functionality and resolve the error.

Here are the necessary code changes in *SEARCH/REPLACE* format:

```pythony
### sympy/core/sympify.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    hit = False
=======
    hit = False
    kern = '_'
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/core/sympify.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    hit = False\n=======\n    hit = False\n    kern = '_'\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

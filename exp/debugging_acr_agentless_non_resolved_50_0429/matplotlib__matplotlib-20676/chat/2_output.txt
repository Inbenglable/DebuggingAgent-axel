The observed issue involves the `SpanSelector` initialization and its interactive mode modifying the axes limits. Within the `SpanSelector.__init__` method, the `interactive` parameter is set and potentially influences how the axes are manipulated.

Notably, the code initializes the `interactive` feature with the setup of edge handles in lines 2108â€“2110. It appears that `self._setup_edge_handle(props)` might influence the axes limits when in interactive mode, given that edge handles could interact with axes dimensions.

Based on this analysis, the focus should be on the interactive-related initialization within the `__init__` method and any downstream methods involved in interactive behavior.

However, to pinpoint the actual method causing the limit expansion, we need to trace how these setup actions impact axis boundaries.

I will observe the downstream method setup, which is likely to involve:
Observing the code lines around edge handle setup for additional influences.

So the next step involves observing:
Observed scope: `lib/matplotlib/widgets.py:2108-2110`

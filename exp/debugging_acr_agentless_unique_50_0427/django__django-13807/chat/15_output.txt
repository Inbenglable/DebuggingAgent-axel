To determine whether the issue is resolved, let's evaluate the patch and the test output.

### Patch Review:
The patch aims to wrap the table names in double quotes when constructing SQL queries to prevent syntax errors related to SQL reserved words. The changes applied are as follows:

1. In the `check_constraints` function:
   - Change from `cursor.execute('PRAGMA foreign_key_check(%s)' % table_name)` to `cursor.execute(f'PRAGMA foreign_key_check("{table_name}")')`.

2. In another function (presumably where foreign keys of tables are evaluated):
   - Change from `foreign_key = cursor.execute('PRAGMA foreign_key_list(%s)' % table_name)` to `foreign_key = cursor.execute(f'PRAGMA foreign_key_list("{table_name}")')`.

3. When selecting from tables:
   - Change from `'SELECT %s, %s FROM %s WHERE rowid = %%s' % (...)` to `'SELECT %s, %s FROM "%s" WHERE rowid = %%s' % (...)`.

The patch correctly addresses the syntax error by quoting table names, ensuring that reserved words like "Order" do not cause operational errors in SQLite.

### Test Output Analysis:
Before and after applying the patch, the output indicates that there is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for 'test_app':

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'test_app'
```

This error results from an issue in the testing setup, where the test script attempts to register an application named 'test_app' without actually creating a module named 'test_app'. Therefore, it is not related to the original bug concerning reserved SQL keywords in table names in SQLite. The actual test case does not progress to the part where it would rely on the patched code to check the constraint issue with table names being reserved words, due to this setup error.

### Conclusion:
The patch itself addresses the syntax error in SQLite concerning SQL reserved words and their table names. However, the testing environment (inside the `reproduce.py` script) fails before it can verify the patch due to a setup error unrelated to the actual Django bug.

Issue resolved: `True`

The patch correctly implements the quoting mechanism needed for table names; however, further adjustments are needed in the testing code setup to verify the patch effectively.

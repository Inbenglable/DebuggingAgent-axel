The patch modifies the `get_feature_names` method in the `CountVectorizer` class, addressing the issue where a `NotFittedError` is raised when calling `get_feature_names()` even if a vocabulary is supplied during initialization. The original behavior required the `vocabulary_` attribute to be explicitly set by fitting, which was contrary to expectations for users supplying the vocabulary directly.

### Patch Analysis
1. **Before Patch:**
   - When `get_feature_names()` is called with a vocabulary provided at initialization, a `NotFittedError` is raised because `vocabulary_` wasn't explicitly set.
2. **Patch Changes:**
   - The patch checks if the instance doesn't have `vocabulary_`. If `vocabulary` is initially provided, it assigns `vocabulary_` based on the input (handling both list and dict cases). This logic bypasses raising `NotFittedError`.
3. **After Patch:**
   - The test prints the feature names without raising an error: `Feature names: ['and', 'document', 'first', 'is', 'one', 'second', 'the', 'third', 'this']`.
   - A message "The issue is fixed." confirms that the test case expects the fixed behavior.

### Conclusion
The patch correctly modifies the logic in the `get_feature_names` method, ensuring it works as expected when a vocabulary is provided at initialization. The test output after applying the patch shows that no exception is raised, and the functionality now returns the expected feature names. Thus, the issue appears to be resolved.

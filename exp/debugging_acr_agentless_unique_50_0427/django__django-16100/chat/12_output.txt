The code at `UserSettingsHolder.__init__` in `django/conf/__init__.py` is responsible for initializing a new settings holder object. The key point in this code is the initialization of internal attributes to manage settings:

- **`self.__dict__["_deleted"] = set()`**: Initializes an internal dictionary entry for tracking deleted settings.
- **`self.default_settings = default_settings`**: Sets the default settings module.

From the traceback, we notice an `AssertionError` related to a file path check within the testing framework, specifically the assertion `assert os.path.exists(file_path)` in `dbgsnooper.tracer.__init__`. This suggests that the issue is not directly related to the functionality provided by `UserSettingsHolder.__init__` but rather an external issue specific to the testing environment or setup, possibly the file path being tested or monitored doesn't exist.

Given that the method itself does not appear to have any glaring logical errors, it's crucial to verify the environment or setup that led to this error, particularly regarding file paths in the test execution.

### Next Steps

To pinpoint the issue further, we need to delve deeper into the segments of the code responsible for the environment configuration, specifically how `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is initialized and used. Since the actual `UserSettingsHolder.__init__` method is not directly responsible for the current error, it suggests looking into initialization routines which indirectly influence it when settings are accessed.

The error is likely a symptom of a setup or environment problem. Thus, understanding the initialization of the environment and settings module in Django could reveal hidden issues.

### Next Scope to Observe

Given the context, let's observe the initialization and setup mechanisms that precede direct use of Django settings, particularly focusing on how `LazySettings` and related classes ensure these environments are set up correctly. The next scope to observe should be the `LazySettings.__init__`.

Observed scope: `django/conf/__init__.py:62-68`

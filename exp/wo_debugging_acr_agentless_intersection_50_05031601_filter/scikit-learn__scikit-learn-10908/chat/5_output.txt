Upon reviewing the patch and analyzing the test outputs, here is the determination:

### Patch Analysis:
- The change in the `_check_vocabulary` method correctly identifies whether the `vocabulary_` attribute should be set based on the initialization. 
- The code checks if the `vocabulary` is provided at initialization and sets the `vocabulary_` accordingly, thus preventing the `NotFittedError` when using custom vocabulary.

### Test Analysis:
- **Original Output**: When running the test before the patch, the execution raises a `NotFittedError`. This is due to the absence of the `vocabulary_` being fitted when using a custom vocabulary.
- **Patched Output**: After applying the patch, the expected output is achieved. The `get_feature_names()` method works correctly using the provided vocabulary, and the test outputs the feature names successfully, indicating no errors.

Based on the patched output showing successful execution and correct behavior of the `CountVectorizer` with a provided vocabulary, the issue has been resolved.

Issue resolved: `True`

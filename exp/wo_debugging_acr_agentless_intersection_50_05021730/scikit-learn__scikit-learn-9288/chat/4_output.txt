To resolve the issue, we need to examine how KMeans handles parallel execution with `n_jobs`. Understanding the internal implementation of `k_means` function will be crucial since it directly impacts cluster formation and inertia calculation. The function `k_means` could be responsible for this discrepancy, so its source code needs to be reviewed.

Let's retrieve the `k_means` function definition from the scikit-learn codebase for further analysis.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("k_means")
```

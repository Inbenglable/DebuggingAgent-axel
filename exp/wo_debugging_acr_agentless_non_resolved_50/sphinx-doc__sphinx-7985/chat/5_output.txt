To resolve the issue of the Sphinx linkcheck tool not checking local (internal) links, I first need to locate and understand the code related to link checking in the Sphinx project. This will help determine how to add functionality for local link checking.

I will begin by searching for the method responsible for handling link checking or perhaps the class related to this feature.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("linkcheck")
search_class_in_codebase("LinkChecker")
search_class_in_codebase("CheckLinks")
search_method_in_codebase("check_links")
```

Upon reviewing the patch and its results, here are my findings:

1. **Patch Review**:
   - The patch introduces additional logic to skip the monotonicity check for dimensions that are identical across all datasets.
   - The key line added is: `identical_across_datasets = all(np.array_equal(ds[dim].values, datasets[0][dim].values) for ds in datasets)`.
   - The logic seems correct for avoiding monotonicity checks on identical dimensions.

2. **Test Output Analysis**:
   - Before the patch was applied, the code raised a `ValueError` indicating that the resulting object does not have monotonic global indexes along the dimension `y`.
   - After the patch, the output shows a `NameError`: `name 'np' is not defined`.

3. **Issue with the Patch**:
   - The `NameError` suggests that `numpy` (`np`) was not imported in the `combine.py` file where the patch was applied. This is a simple oversight which causes the updated code to fail.

4. **Assessment**:
   - The strategy of the patch to bypass the monotonicity check for identical dimensions is logical and aligns with the description in the issue.
   - However, the missing import of `numpy` results in a runtime error that prevents the test from completing successfully.

Therefore, the issue is not resolved because the patched code did not run successfully due to a missing import.

Issue resolved: `False`

To determine whether the issue is resolved, let's go through the provided information step by step:

1. **Bug Issue Summary**: The original issue is about adding DISTINCT support for Django's database aggregation functions (i.e., `Avg`, `Sum`, `Min`, `Max`). This is considered a bug because these aggregates should support the DISTINCT keyword, which is not functioning correctly in the current implementation.

2. **Reproduce Test**: The test setup provided is supposed to test whether the `distinct` argument raises an exception with these aggregates. The tests aim to ensure that these functions work without errors when `distinct=True`.

3. **Original Output**: The output error `django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady` indicates an issue with the Django application registry not being fully set up before the test operations were run. This error is unrelated to the functionality of DISTINCT support in aggregates; instead, it's an error in how the test environment is initialized.

4. **Patch Context**: The patch seems to correctly add `allow_distinct = True` to each of the classes for `Avg`, `Sum`, `Min`, and `Max` in `django/db/models/aggregates.py`. This change appears appropriate to allow these classes to accept and handle the DISTINCT keyword as expected.

5. **Patched Output**: After applying the patch, the output remains the same with the `django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady` error. This suggests that the test itself still does not properly initialize the Django application context, leading to the same error unrelated to the DISTINCT functionality.

Given this analysis, the unchanged error before and after the patch indicates that the test environment setup is causing problems, not the DISTINCT functionality itself. Without a successful test run, we cannot conclusively determine if the DISTINCT support works post-patch.

**Issue resolved: `False`**

While the patch seems to address the DISTINCT support issue correctly, the unchanged error output implies that the issue cannot yet be verified as resolved due to improper test setup rather than a failure in the DISTINCT functionality itself.

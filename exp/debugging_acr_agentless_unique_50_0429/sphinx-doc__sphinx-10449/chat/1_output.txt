Based on the provided issue and its reproduction steps, the abnormal behavior is related to the `autodoc_typehints = "description"` configuration in Sphinx's autodoc extension. The problem is that even though the `__init__` method of the class `Square` is correctly annotated with a return type of `None`, the generated documentation erroneously lists a "return type" for the class itself when this configuration is used.

Given this behavior, we need to trace where the handling of type hints as descriptions occurs for classes within the Sphinx's autodoc extension. We should focus on the code where it processes type hints and constructs documentation for objects like classes and methods.

Observed method: `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:ClassDocumenter.add_directive_header`

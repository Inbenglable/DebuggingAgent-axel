To resolve the issue, we need to locate the source of the problem which appears to be in the method `sylow_subgroup` of the `PermutationGroup` class. The error is arising from the `minimal_blocks` method. To address this, we'll first need to retrieve the source code for `PermutationGroup.sylow_subgroup` and `PermutationGroup.minimal_blocks` to understand why the `IndexError` is occurring. 

Let's begin by obtaining the source code for these methods.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/perm_groups.py", "PermutationGroup.sylow_subgroup")
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/perm_groups.py", "PermutationGroup.minimal_blocks")
```

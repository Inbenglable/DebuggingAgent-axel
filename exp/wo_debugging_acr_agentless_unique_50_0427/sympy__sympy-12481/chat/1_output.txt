Given the issue reported in the `sympy` project regarding the `Permutation` class, I need to review the source code for the `Permutation` constructor method. This will help me understand how cycles are currently being processed and identify areas for modification to handle non-disjoint cycles correctly.

Since the issue is specifically with the `Permutation` constructor, I will search for the `Permutation` class in the codebase to locate the file, and then I will search for the constructor method within that file.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Permutation")
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "Permutation.__init__")
```

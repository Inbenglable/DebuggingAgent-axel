To resolve this issue, I need to make a change in the `get_group_by` method within the `django.db.models.sql.compiler` module. I need to inspect the source code of this method first to understand its current implementation and determine where to apply the changes required to fix the bug with `order_by('?')`.

Therefore, I will proceed to search for the `get_group_by` method in the project's codebase, as the file path for this method isn't directly specified in the issue description.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("get_group_by")
```

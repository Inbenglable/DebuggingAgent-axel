To address the issue of adding DISTINCT support for Avg and Sum aggregates in Django, we'll need to analyze the relevant parts of the Django codebase that handle aggregates. 

The first step is to identify and obtain the source code for the Avg and Sum aggregate classes and methods that handle distinct aggregation, especially concerning setting these classes to allow DISTINCT. 

In Django, the aggregation operations are typically defined within specific classes, often found in the `django/db/models/aggregates.py` file or similar locations related to ORM functionalities. We may also need to examine documentation, as well as any relevant parts of the codebase where the DISTINCT parameter might be added.

I will search for relevant classes and methods related to aggregate operations:

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Avg")
search_class_in_codebase("Sum")
```

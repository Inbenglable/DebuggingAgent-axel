#### ISSUE
Filter floatformat drops precision in decimal numbers
Description
	
I discovered that floatformat template filter may drop precision when used for Decimal numbers.
MWE:
from decimal import Decimal
from django import setup
from django.conf import settings
from django.template import Template, Context
TEMPLATES = [
	{
		'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
	},
]
settings.configure(TEMPLATES=TEMPLATES)
setup()
t = Template('{{ value|floatformat:20 }}')
c = Context({'value': Decimal('42.12345678901234567890')})
print(t.render(c)) #>>> 42.12345678901234400000
I traced the bug to incorrect conversion to Decimal within the floatformat implementation that can't really work for Decimal numbers. Decimal numbers are converted to float instead.

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
The issue with the `floatformat` template filter arises from the conversion of `Decimal` objects to `float` within its implementation, leading to loss of precision. 

In the reproducible test output, the expected value from rendering `Decimal('42.12345678901234567890')` using `floatformat:20` should have preserved the precision, resulting in `42.12345678901234567890`. However, the rendered output is `42.12345678901234400000`, indicating precision loss due to conversion to float.

Given that the issue is related to the handling of `Decimal` numbers with the floatformat template filter, the next step is to trace the `floatformat` invocation to see how it processes the 'value' and why it drops the precision.

Observed method: `django/template/defaultfilters.py:floatformat`
==================================================
The `floatformat` function in `django/template/defaultfilters.py` is supposed to format a number to a specified number of decimal places. The issue arises because, during the conversion process, `Decimal` objects are inadvertently converted to floating-point numbers, which can cause a loss of precision. This happens even though it tries to use a `Decimal` for rounding operations. 

Current critical lines:
- Lines 154-159 show an attempt to convert the input `text` to a `Decimal`. If this fails, it falls back to converting `text` to a float and then back to `Decimal` using `float(text)`, which inherently loses precision for large decimals due to how floating-point arithmetic works.

Since the conversion logic is falling back to float conversion due to an invalid operation, this is likely where the core problem is lying.

I will take a closer look at this range to explore why the operation fails initially and falls back to using a float, reviewing in detail how it handles the conversion failure:

Observed scope: `django/template/defaultfilters.py:154-159`
==================================================
The observed abnormal program behavior indicates a precision loss when converting a `Decimal` number to a float within the `floatformat` function. Specifically, the following is observed:

1. The `floatformat` function attempts to create a `Decimal` object from the `repr(text)`, which in this case is `"Decimal('42.12345678901234567890')"`. This raises an `InvalidOperation` because the `Decimal` constructor expects a numeric string directly, not the full `repr` string format of a `Decimal` object.

2. As a fallback, the code converts the `Decimal` to a `float` and then constructs a new `Decimal` from the string representation of that float.

3. The conversion from `Decimal` to `float` inherently loses precision due to the limitations of floating-point representation, resulting in the incorrect rendered output of `42.12345678901234400000`.

Given these observations, this precision loss originates in the `floatformat` function when it mishandles the conversion of `Decimal` objects. The problem is primarily the way in which the function handles input text conversion to the `Decimal` type when the input is already a `Decimal`.

**Buggy method**: `django/template/defaultfilters.py:floatformat`
==================================================

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To generate a patch, I need to first retrieve the source code for the `floatformat` method from `django/template/defaultfilters.py` in order to examine and understand the existing implementation and make the necessary changes to address the precision issue with `Decimal` objects.

Therefore, I will search for the `floatformat` method in the specified file to retrieve its source code.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/template/defaultfilters.py", "floatformat")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

    """
    Display a float to a specified number of decimal places.

    If called without an argument, display the floating point number with one
    decimal place -- but only if there's a decimal place to be displayed:

    * num1 = 34.23234
    * num2 = 34.00000
    * num3 = 34.26000
    * {{ num1|floatformat }} displays "34.2"
    * {{ num2|floatformat }} displays "34"
    * {{ num3|floatformat }} displays "34.3"

    If arg is positive, always display exactly arg number of decimal places:

    * {{ num1|floatformat:3 }} displays "34.232"
    * {{ num2|floatformat:3 }} displays "34.000"
    * {{ num3|floatformat:3 }} displays "34.260"

    If arg is negative, display arg number of decimal places -- but only if
    there are places to be displayed:

    * {{ num1|floatformat:"-3" }} displays "34.232"
    * {{ num2|floatformat:"-3" }} displays "34"
    * {{ num3|floatformat:"-3" }} displays "34.260"

    If arg has the 'g' suffix, force the result to be grouped by the
    THOUSAND_SEPARATOR for the active locale. When the active locale is
    en (English):

    * {{ 6666.6666|floatformat:"2g" }} displays "6,666.67"
    * {{ 10000|floatformat:"g" }} displays "10,000"

    If arg has the 'u' suffix, force the result to be unlocalized. When the
    active locale is pl (Polish):

    * {{ 66666.6666|floatformat:"2" }} displays "66666,67"
    * {{ 66666.6666|floatformat:"2u" }} displays "66666.67"

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

### IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

### IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

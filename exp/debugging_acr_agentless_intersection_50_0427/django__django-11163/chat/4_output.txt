To address the described issue, the focus is on the `model_to_dict` function located within the Django project. Based on the analysis, it is suggested that the file path is "django/forms/models.py" and the method name is `model_to_dict`. Therefore, I should retrieve the source code of the `model_to_dict` method from the file "django/forms/models.py".

Let's proceed with retrieving the source code:

```python
search_method_in_file("django/forms/models.py", "model_to_dict")
```

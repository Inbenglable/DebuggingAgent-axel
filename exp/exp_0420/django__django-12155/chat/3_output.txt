To proceed with generating the patch, I need to retrieve the source code for the `trim_docstring` method located in `django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py`. I will use the `search_method_in_file` API to find and obtain the method's code.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py", "trim_docstring")
```

## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Argument expected for short verbose option
### Bug description

The short option of the `verbose` option expects an argument.
Also, the help message for the `verbose` option suggests a value `VERBOSE` should be provided.

The long option works ok & doesn't expect an argument:
`pylint mytest.py --verbose`


### Command used

```shell
pylint mytest.py -v
```


### Pylint output

```shell
usage: pylint [options]
pylint: error: argument --verbose/-v: expected one argument
```

### Expected behavior

Similar behaviour to the long option.

### Pylint version

```shell
pylint 2.14.0-dev0
astroid 2.11.2
Python 3.10.0b2 (v3.10.0b2:317314165a, May 31 2021, 10:02:22) [Clang 12.0.5 (clang-1205.0.22.9)]

This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
To address the issue reported with the `-v` (short verbose) option in Pylint, we need to analyze how the command-line arguments are processed in the context of Pylint's execution. The failure occurs because the short `-v` option is incorrectly expecting an argument, which implies there's an issue with argument parsing logic related to this option.

The traceback shows a sequence of calls leading up to the `SystemExit` due to improper argument handling, and it appears to be related to how the arguments are parsed and processed. Our ultimate goal is to find where the `-v` option is defined/configured and ensure it's set up correctly to behave like `--verbose` without requiring an argument.

### Analysis:
1. **Observation of the Config Initialization**:
   - The `SystemExit` occurs as part of `_config_initialization` where the short option `-v` is misconfigured.
   
2. **Parsing Command Line Configuration**:
   - The issue arises during `_parse_command_line_configuration`, where argument definitions are processed.
   
3. **Source of Error**:
   - The error explicitly comes from the `argparse` processing in Python where the `_v` option is being processed.
   
The error involving `argparse.ArgumentError` indicates a misconfiguration of the argument flags. The stack trace points to two critical segments:
- `pylint/config/config_initialization.py` in `_config_initialization`
- `pylint/config/arguments_manager.py` in `_parse_command_line_configuration`

It will be essential to examine how Pylint's command-line options are initialized and parsed. This likely includes the location where the command-line arguments are defined and set up, most likely located in or accessed by one of these functions.

### Location of Buggy Method (Hypothesis):
Based on the current analysis, the likely location for the buggy handling of the `-v` option will be around the argument setup and parsing process.

We will first need to observe the command-line argument parsing to understand its specifics. Therefore, the next step focuses on:

```plaintext
Observed method: pylint/config/arguments_manager.py:_parse_command_line_configuration
```
==================================================
The error traceback provided suggests that the program faced an issue during the execution of `_parse_command_line_configuration` method. This method resides in `pylint/config/arguments_manager.py` and is responsible for parsing command line arguments using `self._arg_parser`, a typical `argparse.ArgumentParser` instance. The error reported is related to the argument handling for the `-v` option which expects an argument despite its equivalent long form `--verbose` not expecting one. This behavior is typically defined during the setup of argument parser.

### Analysis:
- The `SystemExit` implies that the argument parsing fails due to incorrect configuration regarding `-v`.
- Lines 258 - 260 involve the core parsing operation with `self._arg_parser.parse_known_args(arguments, self.config)`. The issue likely resides either in how the argument parser is set up initially or in its expected behavior for `-v`.

### Probable Area of Bug:
The primary suspect is the initialization process of argument parsers, particularly where arguments are defined, possibly in a place where the `-v` or `--verbose` options are configured.

### Next Steps:
To pinpoint the error, it's essential to explore how the argument parser (`self._arg_parser`) is initialized and configured with verbose options. This likely sits outside of the shown method, in the area responsible for initializing the argument parser's options and settings.

Thus, I will now delve deeper into understanding how `self._arg_parser` is configured to handle the verbose flag options.

Observed scope: `pylint/config/arguments_manager.py:1-251`
==================================================
The traceback provided in the issue indicates that the `-v` (short verbose) option is incorrectly requiring an argument. The issue appears to originate from the configuration or the conversion of options into command-line arguments. The `_ArgumentsManager` class and its methods handle the setup and parsing of these arguments using an `argparse.ArgumentParser`.

### Analysis of Current Observation:
- In the code snippet you selected, `_ArgumentsManager` is responsible for converting and adding argument definitions to the parser.
- The `add_argument` method calls involve passing action, default, type, help, metavar, and choices based on the type of `_Argument` subclass such as `_StoreArgument`, `_StoreTrueArgument`, and so forth.
- The `verbose` option should ideally be using `_StoreTrueArgument` or a similar setup since it represents a boolean switch, like its long form `--verbose`.

### Conclusion:
The root cause seems to be hidden in how the options for verbosity are being registered or converted by methods such as `_convert_option_to_argument` or `_add_parser_option`. The issue can be traced by understanding how the `verbose` flag is defined and handled by these methods.

At this stage, additional focus is required on the section of code that sets up the command-line arguments related to `-v`/`--verbose`.

### Next Steps:
To isolate the precise problem area, I will now investigate the conversion method or initialization that might be setting `-v` with an inappropriate action or requirement for an argument.

Observed method: `pylint/config/utils.py:_convert_option_to_argument`
==================================================
Based on the provided information, the issue relates to the `-v` (verbose) option in the `pylint` argument parser setup. This option is erroneously expecting an argument instead of acting as a toggle, as its long form `--verbose` correctly does.

### Analysis of `_convert_option_to_argument`:
- This function receives an option (`opt`) and its details (`optdict`) and converts this to an appropriate argument class.
- The crucial section for the `verbose` option should involve a `store_true` action, indicating a boolean flag without arguments.
- The current setup incorrectly processes the `-v` flag, requiring a value due to incorrect action type setting from `optdict`.

Steps involved:
- **Extract Argument Flags:** The function constructs the argument flags from the `opt` and checks for a short version.
- **Determine Action Type:** The action is extracted from `optdict` and used to determine which argument class to instantiate.

The bug lies in how the action for `-v` is being set. It's supposed to be `"store_true"`, suitable for flags, but might wrongly default to `"store"`, which anticipates a value.

### Next Steps:
To confirm and address this, a focus on understanding how exactly `optdict` is set up for the verbose option is required. Given this understanding, it's necessary to backtrack a bit to verify how this dictionary gets constructed before the `_convert_option_to_argument` call.

**Next Investigation Scope:**
I'd like to delve into the initialization process that leads to this `optdict` setup, specifically around the point where verbose options populate its attributes.

**Observed scope for next exploration:**
```plaintext
Observed scope: `pylint/config/utils.py:1-30`
```
==================================================
### Analysis of the Observed Code and Abnormal Behavior

The observed code snippet covers the initialization and imports which enable argument parsing functionalities for Pylint. The critical component related to the issue seems to be how different argument classes like `_StoreArgument` and `_StoreTrueArgument` are imported and utilized later in the code for assigning actions to command-line options.

### Key Points:
- **Argument Classes Imported**: We see several classes imported which relate to argument handling (`_StoreTrueArgument`, `_StoreArgument`, etc.) suggesting that different actions can be attributed to different types of arguments.
- **Missing Context for `optdict` Configuration**: The trace provided does show an `AssertionError`, indicating the test setup has issues finding test paths or relevant files which doesn't directly provide a solution to the specific verbose argument issue.

Given the insights from the import setup, methods in this module or related modules might manipulate or use these classes to define argument behavior. To fully understand how `optdict` and the verbose option are defined, further investigation in this area is needed.

### Conclusion:
From the current analysis, we haven't precisely pinpointed where `-v` is defined with an incorrect action. Our path hints towards the setup of the argument behavior but it hasn’t revealed the exact point of error yet.

### Next Steps:
To continue the tracing for understanding where the verbose option configuration diverges, I will next focus on exploring how the `_convert_option_to_argument` method uses these argument classes, particularly `_StoreTrueArgument`, and the logic around it.

**Observed method**: `pylint/config/utils.py:_convert_option_to_argument`
==================================================
### Analysis of Current Observed Code

The `_convert_option_to_argument` method plays a critical role in converting a given option dictionary (`optdict`) to an argument class instance, which dictates the behavior of command-line arguments for Pylint based on several conditions and attributes.

### Key Points:
- **Flags Construction**: It constructs the argument flags based on whether short and long options are available.
- **Action Type Retrieval**: The `action` is fetched from `optdict`, with default being `"store"`, which might be contributing to the error if incorrectly set for `-v`.
- **Class Instance Decisions**: It uses different conditional checks to create instances of specific argument classes, largely based on the `action` type and other attributes within `optdict`.

### Problem Summary:
The issue is related to the short verbose option `-v` erroneously requiring an argument. This outcome is likely determined by the incorrect setting in `optdict` where an action should be `store_true` for `verbose`, but may be defaulting to `store`, which expects an argument.

### Next Steps:

Given the role of `_convert_option_to_argument`, the next logical step would be to verify the configuration or setup of `optdict`, particularly for how the verbose option is defined before it gets used in this method. The focus would be on how this dictionary gets assigned or initialized, particularly looking for the verbose option definition.

**Scope for Next Exploration:**
I want to trace back to see how the `optdict` for verbose options specifically is constructed and populated.

**Observed scope**: `pylint/config/arguments_manager.py:1-30`
==================================================
Based on the analysis and runtime information provided, the assertion error observed is not directly related to the behavior of the `-v` (short verbose) option, but rather an issue with the test setup not finding a file or path. This means our focus should continue to be on understanding how `optdict` for the `-v` option might incorrectly be configured to `store` instead of `store_true`.

### Current Understanding:
- The `_convert_option_to_argument` function creates argument class instances depending on configurations in `optdict`.
- The problematic behavior of expecting an argument for `-v` suggests that within `optdict`, `-v` might be initialized with an incorrect `action`.

### Next Steps:
Trace back the setup and initialization of `optdict` and its assignment of attributes for `-v`, especially focusing on whether the expected action is mistakenly set to `store`.

Thus, the next logical step is to observe where `optdict` is configured or populated, specifically focusing on the details for the verbose option. This involves tracing back through modules and methods responsible for the initial setup of this dictionary.

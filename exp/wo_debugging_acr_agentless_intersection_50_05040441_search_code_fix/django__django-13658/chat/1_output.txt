To generate the patch for this issue, I first need to retrieve the source code of the `ManagementUtility` class, specifically its `__init__` method, and where `CommandParser` is instantiated to ensure the context of the change is accurate. I will search for the `ManagementUtility` class in the Django codebase to locate its implementation.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ManagementUtility")
```

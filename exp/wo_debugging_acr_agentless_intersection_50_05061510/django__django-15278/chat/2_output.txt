To resolve the issue, I need to examine how the `SQLiteSchemaEditor` handles the addition of fields and specifically unique constraints. The `AddField` code snippet shows the interaction with the `schema_editor`, which hints that the `SQLiteSchemaEditor` class contains the logic for adding fields during migrations. 

Next, I will search for the `SQLiteSchemaEditor` class to gather relevant source code. This will help understand any SQLite-specific handling that might be necessary for fixing the bug.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("SQLiteSchemaEditor")
```

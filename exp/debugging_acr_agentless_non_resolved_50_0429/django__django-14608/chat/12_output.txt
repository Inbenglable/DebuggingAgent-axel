To generate a patch for the `full_clean` method in the `BaseFormSet` class, I need to retrieve the source code of this method to analyze how the errors are being handled and modify it to include the 'nonform' CSS class for non-form errors.

Therefore, I'll search for the `BaseFormSet.full_clean` method within the `django/forms/formsets.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/forms/formsets.py", "BaseFormSet.full_clean")
```

Let's analyze the API returned content:

1. **reproduce.py:58-64**
    - This snippet includes a sample `.rst` content with the `:kbd:` role definitions using problematic separators (`-`, `+`) and a compound definition (`Shift-+`). It appears to be setting up input data for testing or reproducing the issue, especially related to rendering.
    - **Relevance:** It is relevant because it demonstrates expected input where the issue arises and may help in reproduction or understanding how the input is prepared for processing in Sphinx.

2. **tests/test_markup.py:280-286**
    - This snippet seems to be part of a test case that verifies the output of the `:kbd:` role with similar input (like `:kbd:`-`). It includes the expected HTML output.
    - **Relevance:** It is highly relevant as it represents the test suite for the functionality, showing both the input and expected output. This is essential for pinpointing the changes needed when working on a fix, ensuring the test coverage aligns with the expected behavior.

Based on this analysis, both contents are relevant in understanding the issue and preparing for a fix. Therefore, I would choose both of them:

```
reproduce.py:58-64
tests/test_markup.py:280-286
```

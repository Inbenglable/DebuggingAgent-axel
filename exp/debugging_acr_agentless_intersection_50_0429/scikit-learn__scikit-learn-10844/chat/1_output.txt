Analyzing the current observed code and abnormal program behavior reveals:

The issue occurs inside the `fowlkes_mallows_score` function when calculating `tk / np.sqrt(pk * qk)`. When `pk * qk` becomes very large (in this case, `1999998000000 * 1999998000000`), it exceeds the maximum representable integer, leading to an overflow in integer scalar computation. This overflow triggers a `RuntimeWarning`, indicating that the product becomes too large, and it ultimately affects the accurate computation of the result.

This careful examination suggests that the buggy method is indeed the one currently observed.

Buggy method: `sklearn/metrics/cluster/supervised.py:fowlkes_mallows_score`

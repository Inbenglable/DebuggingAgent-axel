To resolve the issue, I need to inspect the implementation of the `kahane_simplify` function to understand how the leading matrices are managed and correctly identify the bug for fixing. Therefore, I need to search for the `kahane_simplify` method in the SymPy codebase.

Since the file where this method is located is not provided, I'll start by searching for the method in the whole project codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("kahane_simplify")
```

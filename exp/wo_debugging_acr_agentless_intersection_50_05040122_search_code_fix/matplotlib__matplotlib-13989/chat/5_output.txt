Issue resolved: `True`

The patch modifies the histogram bin edge calculation and correctly accounts for the range specified when `density=True`. As per the patched output, the bin edges now start at 0 and end at 1, which aligns with the expected outcome. The bug where the range was not respected when `density=True` appears to be resolved based on the provided test output.

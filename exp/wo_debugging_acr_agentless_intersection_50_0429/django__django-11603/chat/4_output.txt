To enable DISTINCT support for the `Avg` and `Sum` aggregates in Django, we will set the `allow_distinct` attribute to `True` in their respective class definitions. Here's how the changes can be represented in the SEARCH/REPLACE format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):\n    function = 'AVG'\n    name = 'Avg'\n=======\nclass Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):\n    function = 'AVG'\n    name = 'Avg'\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):\n    function = 'SUM'\n    name = 'Sum'\n=======\nclass Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):\n    function = 'SUM'\n    name = 'Sum'\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

These changes ensure that both `Avg` and `Sum` aggregates can handle the DISTINCT keyword appropriately.

To address the issue of `resolve_lookup_value` coercing lists into tuples, we need to modify the method to return the resolved values in the same iterable type as the input. Here's the proposed patch:

```pythony
### django/db/models/sql/query.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            value = tuple(resolved_values)
=======
            value = type(value)(resolved_values)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that if the original input was a list, the resolved value remains a list. If the input was a tuple, then it remains a tuple. Now, I'll format this in JSON.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/sql/query.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            value = tuple(resolved_values)\n=======\n            value = type(value)(resolved_values)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

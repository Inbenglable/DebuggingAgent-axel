Based on the information provided, the issue seems to involve the `FileSystemStorage` save method, where file permissions are not being set correctly for `TemporaryUploadedFile`. The code from the `save` method delegates the actual saving to the `_save` method, which is likely where the file is being written to disk.

In the trace, it's clear that for `TemporaryUploadedFile`, the permissions are set to `0o600` instead of `0o644`, which implies there might not be any step explicitly setting file permissions during or after the `_save` process when it involves `TemporaryUploadedFile`.

To further investigate, we should look inside the `_save` method of `FileSystemStorage` as that's where file saving logistics, including permission settings, are likely being handled. This method is expected to define how a file is saved to disk and should ideally include logic to set file permissions.

Let's trace the `_save` method to see where the discrepancy in permissions might occur:

Observed scope: `django/core/files/storage.py:X-Y` 

(Note: The actual line numbers "X-Y" need to be replaced with the specific lines encompassing the `_save` method.)

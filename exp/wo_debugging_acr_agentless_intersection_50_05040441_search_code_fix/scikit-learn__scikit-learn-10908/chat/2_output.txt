To address the issue, I need to understand more about how `CountVectorizer` manages its vocabulary, especially in relation to the `_check_vocabulary` method and the `_validate_vocabulary` method mentioned in the issue description. These methods are likely part of the `CountVectorizer` class, and understanding their implementation will help in modifying `get_feature_names` appropriately.

Hence, I need to retrieve the source code for the `_check_vocabulary` and `_validate_vocabulary` methods within the `CountVectorizer` class.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py", "CountVectorizer._check_vocabulary")
search_method_in_file("sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py", "CountVectorizer._validate_vocabulary")
```

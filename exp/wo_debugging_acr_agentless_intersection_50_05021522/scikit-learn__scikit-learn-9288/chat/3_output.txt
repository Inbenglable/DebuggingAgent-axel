Based on the retrieved information, the primary source of the issue seems to be within the `k_means` function, especially in how it handles parallelization with the number of jobs. The inconsistent results likely stem from differences in seeding or numerical operations that might differ slightly between single-threaded and multi-threaded operations.

The relevant parts of the function, including the handling of `n_jobs` and how it affects the computation of results, have been retrieved. We can see how the `kmeans_single` function is used differently based on the number of jobs, and random seeds are employed for parallel operations.

Given this information, I have enough context regarding the problem. Thus, I am ready to generate the patch to address the issue.

Ready generation: `True`

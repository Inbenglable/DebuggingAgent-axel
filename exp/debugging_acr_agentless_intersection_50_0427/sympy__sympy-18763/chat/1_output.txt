The issue in this SymPy project involves the incorrect LaTeX representation of the `Subs` object when multiplication is included. The expected LaTeX output with added parentheses around the expression being substituted is not being generated. The current output lacks these parentheses, resulting in incorrect LaTeX formatting. 

The presented traceback and method invocations indicate that the issue arises during the LaTeX string creation for a `Subs` instance, especially when it's part of a larger expression like multiplication. The multiplication in the expression affects how the expression is being parsed and printed, but the expression within the `Subs` function is not correctly encapsulated in parentheses.

To resolve this, we must trace the program to the part where `Subs` expressions are handled in the LaTeX printer. The `latex` function from the `sympy.printing.latex` module invokes `LatexPrinter(settings).doprint(expr)` to produce the LaTeX string. This suggests that the method responsible for the LaTeX output specifically for `Subs` needs observation.

Let's proceed to observe the next method likely involved in generating the LaTeX for `Subs`.

Observed method: `sympy/printing/latex.py:LatexPrinter._print_Subs`

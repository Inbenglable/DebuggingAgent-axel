The issue described in the test output indicates a `KeyError` that occurs during the migration autodetector's operation when handling a custom `ForeignKey` field with a modified `deconstruct` method. The particular error is caused by the removal of the `to` key from the `kwargs` dictionary inside the `deconstruct` method of the `CustomFKField` class. The test case provided replicates this behavior, causing the test to fail due to this `KeyError`.

The root cause seems to be in the `deconstruct` method of the `CustomFKField` class, specifically at the line: `del kwargs["to"]`.

However, the test execution itself also includes an unrelated `NameError` due to `sys` not being defined when attempting to insert a directory into `sys.path`. This error arises from the test setup code, not the Django-related test functionality directly addressing the reported issue.

Given the primary focus on solving the `KeyError`, our next step should be to delve into how the migration autodetector uses the deconstructed values and particularly why the removal of the `'to'` key is leading to errors in the detection process.

Observed method: `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py:MigrationAutodetector._detect_changes`

To resolve the issue in the `_check_homomorphism` function and the associated `_image` function, we need to modify the section where images are looked up for the `PermutationGroup` domain. Here's the patch in a SEARCH/REPLACE format:

```python
### sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                if isinstance(domain, PermutationGroup) and r[i] in gens:
=======
                if isinstance(domain, PermutationGroup) and (r[i] in gens or r[i]**-1 in gens):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

In this patch, we enhance the condition to also check if the inverse of the generator is present in `gens`. This should address the issue where inverted generators were causing the test to fail and simplify the homomorphism check accordingly.

Here's the final JSON representation of this patch:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                if isinstance(domain, PermutationGroup) and r[i] in gens:\n=======\n                if isinstance(domain, PermutationGroup) and (r[i] in gens or r[i]**-1 in gens):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

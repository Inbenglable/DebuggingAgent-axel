The issue with `ax.bar([np.nan], [np.nan])` resulted in a `StopIteration` exception in the initial test. The proposed patch introduced changes to handle NaN values in the methods `_safe_first_finite` and `_convert_dx` by allowing them to return NaN or arrays of NaN gracefully without raising exceptions. 

The provided `PATCHED OUTPUT` seems to indicate that the `StopIteration` error was resolved, as the specific traceback for that error is absent. However, there is still an unrelated `AttributeError` associated with package processing that persists both before and after applying the patch. This error, however, seems unrelated to the primary issue of `ax.bar` handling NaN values.

Given these observations:

- The primary issue of handling all-NaN data in `ax.bar` seems to be addressed, as indicated by the absence of the specific traceback related to the `StopIteration`.

Thus, I conclude:

Issue resolved: `True`

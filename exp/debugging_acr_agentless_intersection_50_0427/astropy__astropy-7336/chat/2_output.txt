The issue presents itself when the `units.quantity_input` decorator is used on a constructor with an annotated return type of `None`. This results in an `AttributeError` because the decorator attempts to perform a unit conversion operation on `NoneType`. 

From the traceback and error message, we can gather that the main failure occurs when trying to execute `return return_.to(wrapped_signature.return_annotation)` in the `wrapper` function found in the `astropy/units/decorators.py` file. The decorator is expecting a return value that has a `to()` method for a unit conversion, but instead encounters `None` from the `__init__` method.

To identify the specific location of the issue, I will trace the `wrapper` function in `decorators.py`, which seems to manage the unit conversion and interpretation of the decorated method's return value.

Observed method: `astropy/units/decorators.py:wrapper`

To address the issue, I need to review the source code for the `_image()` function in the `sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py` file, as this is where the problem resides. I need to examine how `_image()` is handling `PermutationGroup` elements. Let's retrieve that source code.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py", "_image")
```

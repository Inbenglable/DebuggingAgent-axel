You are a PR reviewer that needs to review the patch generated by a bug repair agent and determine whether the issue is fixed or not.
This is the bug issue, which is in the **sympy** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
SI._collect_factor_and_dimension() cannot properly detect that exponent is dimensionless
How to reproduce:

```python
from sympy import exp
from sympy.physics import units
from sympy.physics.units.systems.si import SI

expr = units.second / (units.ohm * units.farad)
dim = SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(expr)[1]

assert SI.get_dimension_system().is_dimensionless(dim)

buggy_expr = 100 + exp(expr)
SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(buggy_expr)

# results in ValueError: Dimension of "exp(second/(farad*ohm))" is Dimension(time/(capacitance*impedance)), but it should be Dimension(1)
```

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
## REPRODUCE TEST
```
from sympy import exp
from sympy.physics import units
from sympy.physics.units.systems.si import SI

import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    expr = units.second / (units.ohm * units.farad)
    dim = SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(expr)[1]

    assert SI.get_dimension_system().is_dimensionless(dim)

    buggy_expr = 100 + exp(expr)
    try:
        SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(buggy_expr)
    except ValueError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue is present: Dimension of exp(second/(farad*ohm)) is not correctly identified as dimensionless.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

And this is the original output when running the test (before applying the patch):

The repair agent has tried to generate a patch to fix the issue:
## PATCH CONTEXT
<PATCH_CONTEXT>
To resolve the issue in the `UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension` method where dimensionless exponents are not handled correctly, we can make a small modification to this method to ensure expressions involving functions such as `exp` are evaluated correctly in terms of dimensional consistency. We'll achieve this by updating the code handling `Function` argument dimensions.

Here's the patch in the `SEARCH/REPLACE` format:

```pythony
### sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        elif isinstance(expr, Function):
            fds = [self._collect_factor_and_dimension(
                arg) for arg in expr.args]
            return (expr.func(*(f[0] for f in fds)),
                    *(d[1] for d in fds))
=======
        elif isinstance(expr, Function):
            fds = [self._collect_factor_and_dimension(
                arg) for arg in expr.args]
            dims = [d[1] for d in fds]
            if all(self.get_dimension_system().is_dimensionless(dim) for dim in dims):
                # If all dimensions are dimensionless, return Dimension(1)
                return expr.func(*(f[0] for f in fds)), Dimension(1)
            return expr.func(*(f[0] for f in fds)), *dims
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that if all arguments of a function have dimensionless dimensions, we consider the function itself dimensionless (i.e., `Dimension(1)`). This is typically the case for functions like `exp` where the exponent should be dimensionless.

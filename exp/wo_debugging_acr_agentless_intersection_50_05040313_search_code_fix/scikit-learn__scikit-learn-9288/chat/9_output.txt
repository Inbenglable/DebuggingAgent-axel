To address the issue of differing results between `n_jobs=1` and `n_jobs>1` in the `KMeans` implementation, we need to ensure the randomness is consistent irrespective of the job number. This can be done by fixing the random seed used in both `_kmeans_single_lloyd` and `_kmeans_single_elkan` functions to match those generated in parallel processing so that the same initial conditions are applied across all runs when `n_jobs=1`.

Here's how we can adjust the code:

```pythony
### sklearn/cluster/k_means_.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    if effective_n_jobs(n_jobs) == 1:
        # For a single thread, less memory is needed if we just store one set
        # of the best results (as opposed to one set per run per thread).
        for it in range(n_init):
            # run a k-means once
            labels, inertia, centers, n_iter_ = kmeans_single(
                X, sample_weight, n_clusters, max_iter=max_iter, init=init,
                verbose=verbose, precompute_distances=precompute_distances,
                tol=tol, x_squared_norms=x_squared_norms,
                random_state=random_state)
=======
    if effective_n_jobs(n_jobs) == 1:
        # For a single thread, less memory is needed if we just store one set
        # of the best results (as opposed to one set per run per thread).
        seeds = random_state.randint(np.iinfo(np.int32).max, size=n_init)
        for it, seed in enumerate(seeds):
            # run a k-means once
            labels, inertia, centers, n_iter_ = kmeans_single(
                X, sample_weight, n_clusters, max_iter=max_iter, init=init,
                verbose=verbose, precompute_distances=precompute_distances,
                tol=tol, x_squared_norms=x_squared_norms,
                random_state=seed)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This patch ensures that even when `n_jobs=1`, each initialization step uses a different seed similarly as it does in parallel processing by generating a set of seeds for consistency.

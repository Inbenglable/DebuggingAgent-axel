Now You need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Missing import statement in generated migration (NameError: name 'models' is not defined)
Description
	
I found a bug in Django's latest release: 3.2.4. 
Given the following contents of models.py:
from django.db import models
class MyField(models.TextField):
	pass
class MyBaseModel(models.Model):
	class Meta:
		abstract = True
class MyMixin:
	pass
class MyModel(MyMixin, MyBaseModel):
	name = MyField(primary_key=True)
The makemigrations command will generate the following migration file:
# Generated by Django 3.2.4 on 2021-06-30 19:13
import app.models
from django.db import migrations
class Migration(migrations.Migration):
	initial = True
	dependencies = [
	]
	operations = [
		migrations.CreateModel(
			name='MyModel',
			fields=[
				('name', app.models.MyField(primary_key=True, serialize=False)),
			],
			options={
				'abstract': False,
			},
			bases=(app.models.MyMixin, models.Model),
		),
	]
Which will then fail with the following error:
 File "/home/jj/django_example/app/migrations/0001_initial.py", line 7, in <module>
	class Migration(migrations.Migration):
 File "/home/jj/django_example/app/migrations/0001_initial.py", line 23, in Migration
	bases=(app.models.MyMixin, models.Model),
NameError: name 'models' is not defined
Expected behavior: Django generates a migration file that is valid Python.
Actual behavior: Django generates a migration file that is missing an import statement.
I think this is a bug of the module django.db.migrations.writer, but I'm not sure. I will be happy to assist with debugging.
Thanks for your attention,

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue, I need to investigate the source code responsible for generating migration files in Django, specifically focusing on `django.db.migrations.writer`. This is likely where the import handling is missing or not implemented correctly. 

I will first search for the class `MigrationWriter` in the Django codebase as this appears to be where migration file writing logic would reside. 

```python
search_class_in_codebase("MigrationWriter")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_class_in_codebase("MigrationWriter")
RESULT:
#### django/db/migrations/writer.py:MigrationWriter
```python
class MigrationWriter:
    """
    Take a Migration instance and is able to produce the contents
    of the migration file from it.
    """

    def __init__(self, migration, include_header=True):
        ...

    def as_string(self):
        ...

    @property
    def basedir(self):
        ...

    @property
    def filename(self):
        ...

    @property
    def path(self):
        ...

    @classmethod
    def serialize(cls, value):
        ...

    @classmethod
    def register_serializer(cls, type_, serializer):
        ...

    @classmethod
    def unregister_serializer(cls, type_):
        ...
```


==================================================

Your Output:
To resolve this issue, the next step is to explore the `as_string` method within the `MigrationWriter` class in the file `django/db/migrations/writer.py`. This method is likely responsible for creating the migration file content. Once I have the method's source code, I can determine if modifications are needed to handle the missing import for `models`. 

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/writer.py", "MigrationWriter.as_string")
```

==================================================

Your Output:
To generate a patch for this issue, it seems necessary to modify the part of the `as_string` method where it handles imports. Specifically, ensure that the `from django.db import models` is added appropriately.

I have already retrieved the source code for the `as_string` method, which is where the import management logic resides. Therefore, I am now ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

To resolve the issue, I need to modify the `ModelBackend.authenticate` method in the Django project. Based on the previous analysis, I need to review the current implementation of this method to apply the fix.

Since I have the file path from the debugging agent's analysis (`django/contrib/auth/backends.py`) and the method name (`authenticate`), I will retrieve the source code of the `authenticate` method in this file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/auth/backends.py", "ModelBackend.authenticate")
```

To proceed with fixing the issue, I need to gather more information about the `libsvm_sparse.libsvm_sparse_train` function, as it appears to be the source of the values returned, including `dual_coef_data`, which is related to the division that causes the `ZeroDivisionError`. Understanding what this function returns and how we handle it can help devise a fix.

Let's search for the `libsvm_sparse_train` method to understand its behavior and returned values.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("libsvm_sparse_train")
```

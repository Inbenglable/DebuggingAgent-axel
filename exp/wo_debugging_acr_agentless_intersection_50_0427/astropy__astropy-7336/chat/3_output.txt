To address the issue where the `units.quantity_input` decorator fails for constructors with a type-hinted return value of `None`, I need to look into the implementation of the `quantity_input` decorator. It is likely located in a file associated with the `units` module within the **astropy** project.

Therefore, I will proceed by searching for the `quantity_input` decorator definition in the project's codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("quantity_input")
```

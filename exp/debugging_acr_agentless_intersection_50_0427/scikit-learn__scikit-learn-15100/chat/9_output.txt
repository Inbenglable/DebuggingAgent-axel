Reviewing the patch and the test output reveals the following:

### Patch Analysis
The intended change in the patch was to ensure that the function `strip_accents_unicode` handles strings regardless of their initial normalization state. However, the patch introduces a syntax error in the form of an `IndentationError: unexpected indent`. This suggests that there may be incorrect indentation in the patched code, which prevents the code from executing properly.

### Test Output Analysis
- **Original Output:** The test initially fails as expected, indicating that `strip_accents_unicode(s2)` does not remove the combining tilde from `s2`.
- **Patched Output:** The test output changes from showing the expected assertion failure to an `IndentationError`, which means the code did not run correctly due to the syntax error introduced by the patch.

### Conclusion
Since the patched code results in a syntax error and doesn't fix the original issue (the removal of combining characters from strings already in NFKD form), the issue is not resolved with the current patch.

Issue resolved: `False`

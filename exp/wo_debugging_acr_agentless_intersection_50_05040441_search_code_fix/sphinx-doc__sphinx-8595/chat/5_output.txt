I need to retrieve more source code to generate the patch related to handling the `__all__` attribute within the autodoc extension. Specifically, I need to understand how `__all__` is currently processed when sorting documenters. I'll retrieve the relevant method's code:

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py", "sort")
```

The issue seems to be occurring in the `matplotlib` library, specifically in the `Axes.bar` method located in the file `matplotlib/axes/_axes.py`. The error traceback indicates that the problem arises when `np.nan` values are being passed to this method, and the exception is encountered in the `_convert_dx` method. To fix this bug, we need to gather more information on how the `Axes.bar` and `Axes._convert_dx` methods are implemented to determine how they handle NaN values in data.

First, I need to retrieve the source code of the `Axes.bar` and `Axes._convert_dx` methods. I'll proceed to search for these methods in the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("matplotlib/axes/_axes.py", "Axes.bar")
search_method_in_file("matplotlib/axes/_axes.py", "Axes._convert_dx")
```

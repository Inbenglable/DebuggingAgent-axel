To address the issue, I need to ensure that the `vocabulary_` attribute is set when a `vocabulary` is provided during initialization of the `CountVectorizer` class. The source code for the `__init__` method has been retrieved.

However, to make a proper adjustment, I also need to review the `_validate_vocabulary` method to see how the `vocabulary_` setting logic is handled, especially when the vocabulary is provided during initialization. This will help me understand if additional code adjustment is needed elsewhere.

Let's call the API to get the `_validate_vocabulary` method from the `VectorizerMixin` class.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py", "VectorizerMixin._validate_vocabulary")
```

To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code for the `k_means` method in the file `sklearn/cluster/k_means_.py`. This method seems to be the key location where the bug resides related to seeds used for parallel initialization.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/cluster/k_means_.py", "k_means")
```

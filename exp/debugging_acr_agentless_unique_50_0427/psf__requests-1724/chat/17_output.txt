Issue resolved: `False`

The patch attempts to address the issue by checking if the method is a Unicode string and then converting it to an ASCII byte string. However, the `NameError: name 'unicode' is not defined` in the patched output indicates that the `unicode` type is not recognized in the context where the patch is applied. This suggests that the patch is not correctly handling type-checking for Unicode strings in the Python 2.7 environment. Therefore, the patch does not resolve the issue, as it introduces a new error instead of correcting the original one.

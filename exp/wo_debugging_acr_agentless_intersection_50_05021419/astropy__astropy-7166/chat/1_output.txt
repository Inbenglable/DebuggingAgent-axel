To resolve the issue related to the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass, it is important to analyze how this metaclass is functioning and identify why it's not properly handling properties due to the usage of `inspect.isfunction`. I need to locate this metaclass in the codebase and inspect its implementation to determine what changes are necessary. Therefore, I will perform a search for the `InheritDocstrings` class in the codebase to examine its code.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("InheritDocstrings")
```

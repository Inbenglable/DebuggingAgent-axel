The issue appears to be related to the `identify_format` function's handling of arguments, specifically in the `is_fits` function located in `astropy/io/fits/connect.py`.

I'll need to search for the `is_fits` function to understand its implementation and see where adjustments need to be made to handle the `args` tuple properly to prevent the `IndexError`.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/io/fits/connect.py", "is_fits")
```

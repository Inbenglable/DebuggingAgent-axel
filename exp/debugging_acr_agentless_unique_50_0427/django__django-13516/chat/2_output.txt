To address the issue effectively, I need to review the `handle` method in the `Command` class found in the `reproduce.py` file, as indicated in the debugging history. I'll retrieve the source code for this method to fully understand the context and usage of the `captured_output` function. 

```python
search_method_in_file("reproduce.py", "Command.handle")
```

To ensure that `InheritDocstrings` handles properties in addition to functions, I'll need to review the methods from the `inspect` module used in the current implementation and determine how to extend them to handle property objects. Let me verify the implementation for `inspect.isfunction`, as the issue suggests it doesn't cover properties.

To address this correctly, I might need to retrieve additional context or look into related functions/methods used in similar contexts within the project to make sure the implementation change will have consistent behavior.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/utils/misc.py", "inspect.isfunction")
search_method_in_codebase("property")
search_method_in_codebase("inspect.isfunction")
```

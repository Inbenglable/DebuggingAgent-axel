To proceed with addressing the issue, I need to retrieve the source code for the `authenticate` method in the `ModelBackend` class to implement the suggested patch. 

Since I don't have the file path, I will first search for the method in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("ModelBackend.authenticate")
```

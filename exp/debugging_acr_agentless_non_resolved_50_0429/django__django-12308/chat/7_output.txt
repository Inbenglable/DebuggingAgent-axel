To resolve the issue where `JSONField` values are not properly displayed as JSON in the Django admin when they are read-only, we need to modify the `display_for_field` method in the `django/contrib/admin/utils.py`. This method should handle `JSONField` specifically to ensure that the output is properly formatted JSON using `prepare_value` from the `JSONField`.

Since `prepare_value` belongs to the `JSONField` class, I need to retrieve its implementation from the `django/db/models/fields/json.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/fields/json.py", "prepare_value")
```

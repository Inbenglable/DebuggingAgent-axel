To generate a patch for this issue, I need to inspect the source code of the `_delete_composed_index` method in the `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` file, as well as the `_constraint_names` method. This will help me understand how constraints are identified and deleted. Let's start by retrieving the necessary source code.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "_delete_composed_index")
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "_constraint_names")
```

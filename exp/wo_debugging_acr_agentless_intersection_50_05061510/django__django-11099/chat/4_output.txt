To determine if the issue is resolved, let's examine the information provided:

1. **Review the Patch:**

   - The patch modifies the regular expressions used in `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` from `r'^[\w.@+-]+$'` to `r'\A[\w.@+-]+\Z'`. 
   - This change aims to prevent trailing newlines from being accepted by the validators.

2. **Analyze the Test Outputs:**

   - **Original Output:**
     - The original test output indicates that the validators did not raise an error for usernames with trailing newlines, confirming the issue as described.

   - **Patched Output:**
     - After applying the patch, the test output reveals a `ValidationError`, indicating that the patched validators are now rejecting usernames with trailing newlines.
     - However, the test then encounters a separate issue related to Django's settings not being properly configured (`django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured`), which is unrelated to the original bug regarding newline validation.

Despite the secondary error related to Django settings configuration, the primary issue—validators accepting usernames with trailing newlines—appears to be addressed as the patched validators raised a `ValidationError`, which is the desired behavior.

**Conclusion:**

The trailing newline issue in username validation has been resolved by the patch, as evidenced by the raised `ValidationError`. The secondary error does not impact the resolution of the original issue, but it should be addressed separately for complete test execution.

Issue resolved: `True`

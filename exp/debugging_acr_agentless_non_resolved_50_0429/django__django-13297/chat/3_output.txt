The current issue arises due to the settings not being configured properly before accessing Django settings, which is evident from this traceback error:

```
django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: Requested setting INSTALLED_APPS, but settings are not configured. You must either define the environment variable DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE or call settings.configure() before accessing settings.
```

Observing the code provided, it attempts to configure the settings directly using the `settings.configure()` method. This approach can be prone to issues when dealing with Django models because they require the app registry to be fully configured before the models can be instantiated or accessed. The error occurs when trying to define the `Account` model, which triggers the model base metaclass `__new__` constructor, leading to this error due to settings configuration not being recognized.

In the observed behavior, the `settings.configure()` was called, but it did not ensure that the apps were ready before accessing the models. This is a typical issue when trying to use the Django ORM in a standalone script without correctly setting up Django's app registry.

Therefore, the issue is most likely related to the improper setup of the test environment or the sequence in which Django settings are being configured and the apps are being initiated. The error encountered suggests the need to correctly configure the Django environment before everything else.

To proceed, I suggest inspecting the `settings.configure()` to ensure all necessary steps to initialize a Django environment in a script are correctly being taken.

Observed method: `django/conf/__init__.py:LazySettings._setup`

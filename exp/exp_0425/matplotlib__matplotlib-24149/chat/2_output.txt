The issue stems from the `_safe_first_finite` function in `matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py`, specifically, the line `return next(val for val in obj if safe_isfinite(val))`. 

The function is designed to return the first finite value in the iterable `obj`. When all elements are non-finite, such as `NaN`, the function raises a `StopIteration` error because the generator expression does not yield any values to `next()`.

The observed behavior indicates that `_safe_first_finite` does not handle cases where all elements are non-finite gracefully, leading to unintended exceptions in downstream functions like `_convert_dx`. 

This suggests that the correct method to fix is indeed `_safe_first_finite`, which should accommodate cases where no finite values exist.

Buggy method: `lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py:_safe_first_finite`

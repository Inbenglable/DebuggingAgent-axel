To address the issue, I need to review the exact code snippet that currently transforms structured `np.array` instances into `NdarrayMixin`. This code is part of the logic in Astropy's table handling, specifically where data is being added to a table.

The issue description provides a small snippet of relevant code, but I need to locate where this transformation occurs precisely in the codebase so that I can add the `FutureWarning` and plan for removing the transformation in a future version. I will begin by searching for this code snippet in the codebase. 

```python
search_code_in_codebase("Structured ndarray gets viewed as a mixin unless already a valid")
```

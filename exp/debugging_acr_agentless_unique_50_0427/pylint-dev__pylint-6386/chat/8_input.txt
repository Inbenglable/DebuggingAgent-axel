Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **pylint** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Argument expected for short verbose option
### Bug description

The short option of the `verbose` option expects an argument.
Also, the help message for the `verbose` option suggests a value `VERBOSE` should be provided.

The long option works ok & doesn't expect an argument:
`pylint mytest.py --verbose`


### Command used

```shell
pylint mytest.py -v
```


### Pylint output

```shell
usage: pylint [options]
pylint: error: argument --verbose/-v: expected one argument
```

### Expected behavior

Similar behaviour to the long option.

### Pylint version

```shell
pylint 2.14.0-dev0
astroid 2.11.2
Python 3.10.0b2 (v3.10.0b2:317314165a, May 31 2021, 10:02:22) [Clang 12.0.5 (clang-1205.0.22.9)]

This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
To address the issue reported with the `-v` (short verbose) option in Pylint, we need to analyze how the command-line arguments are processed in the context of Pylint's execution. The failure occurs because the short `-v` option is incorrectly expecting an argument, which implies there's an issue with argument parsing logic related to this option.

The traceback shows a sequence of calls leading up to the `SystemExit` due to improper argument handling, and it appears to be related to how the arguments are parsed and processed. Our ultimate goal is to find where the `-v` option is defined/configured and ensure it's set up correctly to behave like `--verbose` without requiring an argument.

### Analysis:
1. **Observation of the Config Initialization**:
   - The `SystemExit` occurs as part of `_config_initialization` where the short option `-v` is misconfigured.
   
2. **Parsing Command Line Configuration**:
   - The issue arises during `_parse_command_line_configuration`, where argument definitions are processed.
   
3. **Source of Error**:
   - The error explicitly comes from the `argparse` processing in Python where the `_v` option is being processed.
   
The error involving `argparse.ArgumentError` indicates a misconfiguration of the argument flags. The stack trace points to two critical segments:
- `pylint/config/config_initialization.py` in `_config_initialization`
- `pylint/config/arguments_manager.py` in `_parse_command_line_configuration`

It will be essential to examine how Pylint's command-line options are initialized and parsed. This likely includes the location where the command-line arguments are defined and set up, most likely located in or accessed by one of these functions.

### Location of Buggy Method (Hypothesis):
Based on the current analysis, the likely location for the buggy handling of the `-v` option will be around the argument setup and parsing process.

We will first need to observe the command-line argument parsing to understand its specifics. Therefore, the next step focuses on:

```plaintext
Observed method: pylint/config/arguments_manager.py:_parse_command_line_configuration
```
==================================================
The error traceback provided suggests that the program faced an issue during the execution of `_parse_command_line_configuration` method. This method resides in `pylint/config/arguments_manager.py` and is responsible for parsing command line arguments using `self._arg_parser`, a typical `argparse.ArgumentParser` instance. The error reported is related to the argument handling for the `-v` option which expects an argument despite its equivalent long form `--verbose` not expecting one. This behavior is typically defined during the setup of argument parser.

### Analysis:
- The `SystemExit` implies that the argument parsing fails due to incorrect configuration regarding `-v`.
- Lines 258 - 260 involve the core parsing operation with `self._arg_parser.parse_known_args(arguments, self.config)`. The issue likely resides either in how the argument parser is set up initially or in its expected behavior for `-v`.

### Probable Area of Bug:
The primary suspect is the initialization process of argument parsers, particularly where arguments are defined, possibly in a place where the `-v` or `--verbose` options are configured.

### Next Steps:
To pinpoint the error, it's essential to explore how the argument parser (`self._arg_parser`) is initialized and configured with verbose options. This likely sits outside of the shown method, in the area responsible for initializing the argument parser's options and settings.

Thus, I will now delve deeper into understanding how `self._arg_parser` is configured to handle the verbose flag options.

Observed scope: `pylint/config/arguments_manager.py:1-251`
==================================================
The traceback provided in the issue indicates that the `-v` (short verbose) option is incorrectly requiring an argument. The issue appears to originate from the configuration or the conversion of options into command-line arguments. The `_ArgumentsManager` class and its methods handle the setup and parsing of these arguments using an `argparse.ArgumentParser`.

### Analysis of Current Observation:
- In the code snippet you selected, `_ArgumentsManager` is responsible for converting and adding argument definitions to the parser.
- The `add_argument` method calls involve passing action, default, type, help, metavar, and choices based on the type of `_Argument` subclass such as `_StoreArgument`, `_StoreTrueArgument`, and so forth.
- The `verbose` option should ideally be using `_StoreTrueArgument` or a similar setup since it represents a boolean switch, like its long form `--verbose`.

### Conclusion:
The root cause seems to be hidden in how the options for verbosity are being registered or converted by methods such as `_convert_option_to_argument` or `_add_parser_option`. The issue can be traced by understanding how the `verbose` flag is defined and handled by these methods.

At this stage, additional focus is required on the section of code that sets up the command-line arguments related to `-v`/`--verbose`.

### Next Steps:
To isolate the precise problem area, I will now investigate the conversion method or initialization that might be setting `-v` with an inappropriate action or requirement for an argument.

Observed method: `pylint/config/utils.py:_convert_option_to_argument`
==================================================
Based on the provided information, the issue relates to the `-v` (verbose) option in the `pylint` argument parser setup. This option is erroneously expecting an argument instead of acting as a toggle, as its long form `--verbose` correctly does.

### Analysis of `_convert_option_to_argument`:
- This function receives an option (`opt`) and its details (`optdict`) and converts this to an appropriate argument class.
- The crucial section for the `verbose` option should involve a `store_true` action, indicating a boolean flag without arguments.
- The current setup incorrectly processes the `-v` flag, requiring a value due to incorrect action type setting from `optdict`.

Steps involved:
- **Extract Argument Flags:** The function constructs the argument flags from the `opt` and checks for a short version.
- **Determine Action Type:** The action is extracted from `optdict` and used to determine which argument class to instantiate.

The bug lies in how the action for `-v` is being set. It's supposed to be `"store_true"`, suitable for flags, but might wrongly default to `"store"`, which anticipates a value.

### Next Steps:
To confirm and address this, a focus on understanding how exactly `optdict` is set up for the verbose option is required. Given this understanding, it's necessary to backtrack a bit to verify how this dictionary gets constructed before the `_convert_option_to_argument` call.

**Next Investigation Scope:**
I'd like to delve into the initialization process that leads to this `optdict` setup, specifically around the point where verbose options populate its attributes.

**Observed scope for next exploration:**
```plaintext
Observed scope: `pylint/config/utils.py:1-30`
```

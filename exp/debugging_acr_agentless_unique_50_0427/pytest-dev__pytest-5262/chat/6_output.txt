To determine whether the issue is fixed, let's consider the patch and the test outputs.

### Analysis

1. **Patch Review:**
   - The patch aims to modify the `write()` method in the `EncodedFile` class within `_pytest/capture.py`.
   - The patch adds logic to handle `bytes` objects by decoding them using the specified encoding before writing, which means it should accommodate both `str` and `bytes` by converting `bytes` to `str`. This change is intended to prevent the `TypeError` that occurs when `bytes` are passed to the `write()` function.
   - The patch seems appropriate for handling the error described in the issue.

2. **Test Output:**
   - Both the original and patched outputs show a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the `youtube_dl` module.
   - The error is unrelated to the specific issue of handling `bytes` in `write()` within the `EncodedFile` class of pytest, and instead, it's an environment setup issue (absence of the `youtube_dl` module).

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Because the test does not reach the point where it would test the modified behavior (due to the `ModuleNotFoundError`), it's not possible to verify if the patch resolves the issue regarding `write()` method handling.
   - However, based on the implementation details and knowledge of the patch context, it seems logical and aligned with the reported issue description.

Given the inability to run the test due to the environment problem, we cannot directly observe the successful handling of `bytes`. But logically, the patch should resolve the specified issue because it addresses how `write()` should handle `bytes`.

Considering all aspects, my conclusion is:

Issue resolved: `True` (based on patch logic, not test output verification)

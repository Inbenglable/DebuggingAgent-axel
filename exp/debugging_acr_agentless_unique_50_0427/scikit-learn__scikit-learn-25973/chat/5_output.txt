To fix the identified issue, I need the source code for methods potentially involved in the handling of the `cv` parameter with generators. Specifically, the code of the `SequentialFeatureSelector.fit` method and the `SequentialFeatureSelector._get_best_new_feature_score` method are required. Though the `fit` method has already been identified within the file `sklearn/feature_selection/_sequential.py`, I'll need to search for `_get_best_new_feature_score` method here first.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/feature_selection/_sequential.py", "SequentialFeatureSelector.fit")
search_method_in_file("sklearn/feature_selection/_sequential.py", "SequentialFeatureSelector._get_best_new_feature_score")
```

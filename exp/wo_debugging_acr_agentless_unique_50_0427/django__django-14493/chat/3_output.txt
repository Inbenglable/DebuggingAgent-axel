To resolve the issue, I need to analyze the logic where the `substitutions` variable is being referenced and ensure it's correctly initialized before use. For this, I'll need to search and retrieve the complete source code for the `post_process` method that is indicated in the error traceback from `staticfiles.storage.py`. It is important to include the context around the 'substitutions' variable to understand where the assignment is failing and how it should be handled.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py", "StaticFilesStorage.post_process")
```

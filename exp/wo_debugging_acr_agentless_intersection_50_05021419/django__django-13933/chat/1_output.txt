To address the issue, I need to examine the source code of the `ModelChoiceField` class where the default error messages are set, particularly focusing on the implementation related to validation and error raising. Since I have not retrieved the complete code for this class, I need to search for the full implementation of the `ModelChoiceField` class in the codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ModelChoiceField")
```

To resolve the issue with `KMeans` giving inconsistent results based on the `n_jobs` parameter, we need to explore the `k_means` function called within the `KMeans.fit` method, as this is where the core clustering logic is implemented. Since different results are generated based on threading, the root of the discrepancy likely occurs in this function.

I will look up the source code of the `k_means` function within the specified file to understand how it handles parallel processing.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/cluster/k_means_.py", "k_means")
```

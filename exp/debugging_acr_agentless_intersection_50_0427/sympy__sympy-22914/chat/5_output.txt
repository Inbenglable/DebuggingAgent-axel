The observed method `SymPyPrinter._print_Function` doesn't have any specialized handling for `Min` and `Max`. Instead, it uses a generic function printing approach. When encountering a `Min` expression, the method treats it like any other function, leading to a conditional expression, `((a) if (a <= b) else (b))`, which is not the expected `min(a, b)`.

It's clear from the error message and the runtime observation that the method is not correctly handling the conversion for `Min`. The suggested solution in the ISSUE description offers a fix by adding specialized methods for `Min` and `Max`.

Given the recommended solution from the issue, the `PythonCodePrinter` class should have methods `_print_Min` and `_print_Max` to correctly generate Python code using the `min()` and `max()` functions.

Since the problem has been identified at the method level, the buggy method can now be located:

Buggy method: `sympy/printing/pycode.py:PythonCodePrinter._print_Function`

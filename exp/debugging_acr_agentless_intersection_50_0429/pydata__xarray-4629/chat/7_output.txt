To determine if the issue is fixed, let's analyze the patch, the original output, and the patched output.

### Patch Analysis
The patch modifies the behavior of the `merge` function in the `xarray` library. Specifically, the change occurs in the section handling `combine_attrs == "override"`. The original line:
```python
return variable_attrs[0]
```
has been replaced with:
```python
return dict(variable_attrs[0])
```
This change ensures that a copy of the attributes is returned as a dictionary rather than a reference to the original attributes. Therefore, modifications to `xds3.attrs` will not affect `xds1.attrs`, addressing the issue reported.

### Test Output Analysis
- **Original Output:** The test originally failed with an `AssertionError` because changing `xds3.attrs['a']` also unintentionally changed `xds1.attrs['a']`. This demonstrated the bug where the `attrs` of the merged dataset were not independent from the source datasets.
  
- **Patched Output:** After applying the patch, the test output is empty, which implies that the test passed successfully. There were no assertion errors, indicating that the attribute modification of `xds3` did not affect `xds1`, confirming that the issue has been addressed.

### Conclusion
The modification in the patch resolved the issue where attributes were not copied correctly under the `combine_attrs='override'` condition. The patched test output does not show any errors, indicating that the behavior now matches the expectation.

**Issue resolved: `True`**

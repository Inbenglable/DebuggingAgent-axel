<ISSUE>
order_by('?') unexpectedly breaking queryset aggregation
Description
	
Steps to reproduce:
class Thing(models.Model):
	pass
class Related(models.Model):
	models.ForeignKey(Thing)
With data
t = Thing.objects.create()
rs = [Related.objects.create(thing=t) for _ in range(2)]
The following query works as expected. The aggregation with Count produces a GROUP BY clause on related.id.
>>> Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('rc').values('id', 'rc')
<QuerySet [{'id': 1, 'rc': 2}]>
This also works as expected (at least to me). Although there is an aggregation, ordering by related means that the grouping will be broken down.
>>> Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('related').values('id', 'rc')
<QuerySet [{'id': 1, 'rc': 1}, {'id': 1, 'rc': 1}]>
But the following seems wrong to me.
>>> Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('?').values('id', 'rc')
<QuerySet [{'id': 1, 'rc': 1}, {'id': 1, 'rc': 1}]>
The random function call has nothing to do with the aggregation, and I see no reason it should break it. Dumping the query seems that indeed the random call breaks the group by call: (I simpilfied the table names a little)
>>> print(Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('?').values('id', 'rc').query)
SELECT "thing"."id", COUNT("related"."id") AS "rc" FROM "thing" LEFT OUTER JOIN "related" ON ("thing"."id" = "related"."thing_id") GROUP BY "thing"."id", RANDOM() ORDER BY RANDOM() ASC
I dug into the SQL compiler, and it seems to me the problem is inside django.db.models.sql.compiler.get_group_by, where the compiler combines all non-aggregate, non-ref order_by expressions into group_by. I patched it like this
for expr, (sql, params, is_ref) in order_by:
	if expr.contains_aggregate:
		continue
	if is_ref:
		continue
	expressions.extend([
		exp for exp in expr.get_source_expressions()
		if not isinstance(exp, Random)
	])
and things seem to work correctly. No failed tests against SQLite3 with default settings.

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue mentioned, we need to patch the `django.db.models.sql.compiler.get_group_by` method to change its handling of the random order expression when aggregations are involved.

I will first retrieve the source code of the `get_group_by` method from the relevant file to understand its implementation and where the patch needs to be applied.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("get_group_by")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("get_group_by")
RESULT:
#### django/db/models/sql/compiler.py:SQLCompiler.get_group_by
```python
    def get_group_by(self, select, order_by):
        """
        Return a list of 2-tuples of form (sql, params).

        The logic of what exactly the GROUP BY clause contains is hard
        to describe in other words than "if it passes the test suite,
        then it is correct".
        """
        # Some examples:
        #     SomeModel.objects.annotate(Count('somecol'))
        #     GROUP BY: all fields of the model
        #
        #    SomeModel.objects.values('name').annotate(Count('somecol'))
        #    GROUP BY: name
        #
        #    SomeModel.objects.annotate(Count('somecol')).values('name')
        #    GROUP BY: all cols of the model
        #
        #    SomeModel.objects.values('name', 'pk').annotate(Count('somecol')).values('pk')

        # In fact, the self.query.group_by is the minimal set to GROUP BY. It
        # can't be ever restricted to a smaller set, but additional columns in
        # HAVING, ORDER BY, and SELECT clauses are added to it. Unfortunately
        # the end result is that it is impossible to force the query to have
        # a chosen GROUP BY clause - you can almost do this by using the form:
        #     .values(*wanted_cols).annotate(AnAggregate())
        # but any later annotations, extra selects, values calls that
        # refer some column outside of the wanted_cols, order_by, or even
        # filter calls can alter the GROUP BY clause.

        # The query.group_by is either None (no GROUP BY at all), True
        # (group by select fields), or a list of expressions to be added
        # to the group by.

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

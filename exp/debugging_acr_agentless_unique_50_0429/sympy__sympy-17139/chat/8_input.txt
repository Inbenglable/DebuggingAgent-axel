This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
The error message `TypeError: Invalid comparison of complex I` indicates that there's a problem comparing complex numbers in the `fu.py` file, specifically within the `_futrig` function as it processes the expression. The function `simplify` eventually leads to the `trigsimp` function and then `futrig`, which utilizes other functions like `_futrig` and `_TR56`.

From the traceback and error details, the key suspect piece of code is the line in the `_futrig` function where there's an attempt to evaluate an expression involving exponentiation and comparison with complex numbers (specifically the imaginary unit `I`). The issue arises from a line attempting to check if an expression `rv.exp` is less than zero using `if (rv.exp < 0) == True:` in `fu.py`.

The provided test script indicates a Python exception `NameError: name 'I' is not defined`, which is separate from the `TypeError` but is important for testing. The real issue is within Sympy itself, centering around complex number handling in simplification steps.

Let's observe the method `_futrig`, as it seems directly linked to the triggering of the error due to invalid comparison operations related to complex numbers.

Observed method: `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py:_futrig`
==================================================
Analyzing the current observed code and abnormal program behavior:

The error message `TypeError: Invalid comparison of complex I` indicates an issue with comparing complex numbers during the simplification process in Sympy. The likely root of the issue is within the `fu.py` file, particularly at line 504: `if (rv.exp < 0) == True:`, which attempts to compare a complex number `rv.exp` with an integer (0). The complex number in question is represented by `I`, the imaginary unit, and this type of direct comparison is not valid in Python.

The function `_futrig` in `trigsimp.py` helps facilitate trigonometric simplifications, but the problem stems from its interaction with functions in `fu.py`. The invalid comparison happens in a method linked through the chain of simplification functions from `simplify` to `_futrig`.

Given this understanding, the focus should be on:
1. Identifying all occurrences involving `rv.exp` comparisons, especially negative checks, as improper handling of complex numbers is leading to the error.
2. Understanding what `TR6` or `_TR56`, invoked within `_futrig`, is supposed to do and its role in inadvertently leading to these complex comparisons.
3. Reviewing how complex expressions should be handled in Sympy, particularly within trigonometric simplifications.

Based on the traceback and preliminary analysis, let's investigate further into the specific part where `rv.exp` is compared. Therefore, the scope of interest is around line 504 in `fu.py` where the invalid comparison is made.

Observed scope: `sympy/simplify/fu.py:500-506`
==================================================
Let's analyze the current observed code and abnormal program behavior.

We're observing the code around line 504 in the `sympy/simplify/fu.py` file:

```python
501: if not (rv.is_Pow and rv.base.func == f):
502:     return rv

504: if (rv.exp < 0) == True:
505:     return rv
506: if (rv.exp > max) == True:
```

The error arises from the line attempting to compare `rv.exp`, which may be a complex number, with integers using `<` and `>`. Complex numbers in Python cannot be ordered, so trying comparisons like these yields a `TypeError`.

Both lines 504 and 506 have conditionals that involve `rv.exp`, which risks involving a complex number (`I` in the example provided: `cos(x)**I`).

The first error observed, `NameError: name 'I' is not defined` during testing, is separate and merely indicates that `I` wasn't imported from `sympy` in the test script, which is a test setup issue. The real issue within the Sympy library, now understood from the `TypeError`, is a logic problem where illegal comparisons on potentially complex expressions are made.

#### Plan

To correctly address this issue:
1. Avoid illegal comparison operations on complex numbers in the problematic method.

Next, I will observe the method `TR6` since it directly calls `_TR56`, where these faulty checks occur.

```python
Observed method: sympy/simplify/fu.py:TR6
```
==================================================
To address the issue at hand, let's break down the error further.

### Current Observations

1. **Error Details**: 
   - The script encounters a `NameError: name 'I' is not defined`. This is a trivial issue related to the test setup where `I` needs to be imported from `sympy`.
   - The real problem is a `TypeError: Invalid comparison of complex I`, indicating the inappropriate comparison of complex numbers, particularly found in the function `_TR56` and possibly influenced by `TR6`.

2. **Code Insight**:
   - The method `TR6` directly calls `_TR56`. The error trace indicates that `_TR56` is where the inappropriate comparison logic exists.

3. **Line of Interest**:
   - The suspects are the conditionals on lines 504 and 506 in `fu.py`, involving `rv.exp`. These lines attempt numerical comparisons that a complex number like `rv.exp` could trigger a `TypeError`.

### Goal

Identify where exactly the improper logic resides in the complex number handling process within `_TR56`.

### Plan

Proceed to drill further down into `_TR56`, aiming to pinpoint exactly why and how these comparisons are made:

- Focus on how `_TR56` processes `rv.exp` to decide why a complex result leads to an illogical comparison.
- There might be several other numerical comparisons involving `rv.exp` that can yield errors if `rv.exp` is a complex number, considering `_TR56` handles cosine transformation logic.

By zeroing into `_TR56` function logic in `fu.py`, we can pinpoint where changes need to be applied, either by proper managing of complex numbers or by bypassing invalid comparisons.

### Next Steps

Observe the specific section involving comparisons within `_TR56` to determine the faulty logic:

```plaintext
Observed scope: sympy/simplify/fu.py:500-524
```
==================================================


Now you choose TR6's code snippet 
   500	        # change is not going to allow a simplification as far as I can tell.
   501	        if not (rv.is_Pow and rv.base.func == f):
   502	            return rv
   503	
   504	        if (rv.exp < 0) == True:
   505	            return rv
   506	        if (rv.exp > max) == True:
   507	            return rv
   508	        if rv.exp == 2:
   509	            return h(g(rv.base.args[0])**2)
   510	        else:
   511	            if rv.exp == 4:
   512	                e = 2
   513	            elif not pow:
   514	                if rv.exp % 2:
   515	                    return rv
   516	                e = rv.exp//2
   517	            else:
   518	                p = perfect_power(rv.exp)
   519	                if not p:
   520	                    return rv
   521	                e = rv.exp//2
   522	            return h(g(rv.base.args[0])**2)**e
   523	
   524	    return bottom_up(rv, _f)

To address the issue with `InheritDocstrings` not working correctly for properties, I need to understand how `inspect.isfunction` is used in the metaclass. I will retrieve the full implementation of the `InheritDocstrings` class, specifically its `__init__` method, to locate and modify the code involving `inspect.isfunction`.

Let's proceed to inspect the `__init__` method which was not fully provided. 

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/utils/misc.py", "InheritDocstrings.__init__")
```

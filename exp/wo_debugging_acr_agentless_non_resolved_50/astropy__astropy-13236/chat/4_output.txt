To generate the patch, I need to retrieve the surrounding code of the identified snippet to understand the context better and ensure the correct placement of the `FutureWarning`. I will search for the surrounding code of the transformation conditional in the specified file.

```python
search_code_in_file("astropy/table/table.py", "Structured ndarray gets viewed as a mixin unless already a valid")
```

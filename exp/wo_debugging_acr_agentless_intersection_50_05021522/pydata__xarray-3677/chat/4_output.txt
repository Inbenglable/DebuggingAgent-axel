Based on the information I've gathered, the error occurs because the `Dataset.merge` method calls the `dataset_merge_method`, which in turn calls `merge_core`. The issue lies in the handling of `other` (a `DataArray` in this context). The `merge_core` function expects each item in the `objects` list to be some form of mapping, but `DataArray` does not support the `items()` method like a `Dataset` does, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix this, I need to ensure the `Dataset.merge` method correctly handles `DataArray` by converting it to a `Dataset` before merging.

I have gathered enough information to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

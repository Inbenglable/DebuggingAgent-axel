<ISSUE>
autodoc: empty __all__ attribute is ignored
**Describe the bug**
autodoc: empty `__all__` attribute is ignored

**To Reproduce**
```
# example.py
__all__ = []


def foo():
    "docstring"


def bar():
    "docstring"


def baz():
    "docstring"
```
```
# index.rst
.. automodule:: example
   :members:
```

All foo, bar, and baz are shown.

**Expected behavior**
No entries should be shown because `__all__` is empty.

**Your project**
No

**Screenshots**
No

**Environment info**
- OS: Mac
- Python version: 3.9.1
- Sphinx version: HEAD of 3.x
- Sphinx extensions: sphinx.ext.autodoc
- Extra tools: No

**Additional context**
No

==================================================
Your Output:
To fix the issue where an empty `__all__` attribute is ignored in `autodoc`, the following analysis and steps are necessary:

### Analysis
The behavior of Sphinx's autodoc extension in the presence of an `__all__` list needs to be addressed. Specifically, when `__all__` is empty, autodoc should not document any module members. The handling regarding the `__all__` attribute is likely in the module where autodoc processes modules and attributes.

### Steps to Resolve
1. Identify the file and method responsible for determining which members to document based on the `__all__` attribute.
2. Retrieve the source code to understand the logic and handling of the `__all__` attribute.
3. Develop a patch that correctly handles the ignored empty `__all__`.

To proceed, I need to find the relevant method(s) in the Sphinx codebase that deals with checking the `__all__` attribute in the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` extension. I'll start by searching for any function name related to member inclusion logic, potentially involving the `__all__` attribute.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("process_documenter_options")
search_method_in_codebase("get_object_members")
search_method_in_codebase("filter_members")
```

Your Output:
Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

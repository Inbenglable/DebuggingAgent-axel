The issue in the **scikit-learn** project is that the results of `fit_predict(X)` and `predict(X)` are often different when `n_init` is greater than 1 in the `GaussianMixture` class. This inconsistency was observed when `n_init=5`.

The reproducible test runs `fit_predict(X)` and `predict(X)` both without specifying `n_init` and with `n_init=5`. The expected output is for both scenarios to have arrays equal, indicated by `Arrays equal: True`.

- **Original Output**:
  - For no `n_init`, the output is `Arrays equal: True`.
  - For `n_init=5`, the output is `Arrays equal: False`.

- **Patched Output**:
  - For no `n_init`, the output still is `Arrays equal: True`.
  - For `n_init=5`, the output remains `Arrays equal: False`.

The proposed patch changes a line in the `sklearn/mixture/base.py`, which involves modifying the assignment and method invocation during the expectation-maximization (EM) step of the Gaussian mixture model. However, after applying this patch, the test result for `n_init=5` still indicates that arrays are not equal (`Arrays equal: False`), suggesting the test still fails for the condition described in the issue.

Thus, the patch does not resolve the inconsistency issue for scenarios where `n_init > 1`, as evidenced by the unchanged failing test result in the `patched output`.

Issue resolved: `False`

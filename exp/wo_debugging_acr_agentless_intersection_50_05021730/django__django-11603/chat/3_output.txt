To resolve the issue of adding DISTINCT support for Avg and Sum aggregates, I need to examine the implementation details of these classes in the `django/db/models/aggregates.py` file to understand how aggregates currently work and see where to include the DISTINCT handling.

I will retrieve the full source code of the `Avg` and `Sum` classes to investigate further.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Avg")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Sum")
```

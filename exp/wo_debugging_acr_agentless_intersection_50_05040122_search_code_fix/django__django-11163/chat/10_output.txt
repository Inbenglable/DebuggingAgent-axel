To determine whether the patch resolves the issue described, let's break down the steps involved:

1. **Issue Description**: 
   - The function `model_to_dict(instance, fields=[])` should return an empty dictionary when no fields are specified. However, it returns all fields due to the condition:
     ```python
     if fields and f.name not in fields:
     ```
   - This needs to be corrected to:
     ```python
     if fields is not None and f.name not in fields:
     ```

2. **Patch Analysis**:
   - The patch modifies the condition to ensure that the function correctly returns an empty dictionary when an empty list is provided:
     ```json
     {
       "search_replace_edits": [
         "### django/forms/models.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if fields and f.name not in fields:\n=======\n        if fields is not None and f.name not in fields:\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
       ]
     }
     ```
   - The patch changes the condition appropriately.

3. **Test Output Analysis**:
   - **Original Test Output**: The error indicates an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception regarding Django settings. This suggests an environment setup issue rather than a functional one directly related to the patch.
   - **Patched Test Output**: The output still shows the same `ImproperlyConfigured` exception, indicating the test environment still requires proper configuration.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The test outputs show a configuration error and not a failure related to the `model_to_dict` functionality itself. As such, while we can't verify the patch functionality purely based on this test output, the patch does correctly modify the necessary code.
   - To properly test the patch, the test environment should be corrected (configure Django settings properly).

Given the information available, the patch does address the issue as described in changing the code logic, but the test setup problem remains unresolved in both outputs, preventing verification via these tests.

Issue resolved: `True` (following the assumption that the patch itself correctly fixes the specific bug described).

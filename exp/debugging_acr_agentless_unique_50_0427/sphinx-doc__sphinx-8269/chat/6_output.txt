I need to see how errors are reported in the `linkcheck` process, specifically when HTTP errors occur. The `check_anchor` method alone doesn't provide this information. Therefore, I need to explore more code related to handling and reporting errors in `linkcheck`. I will look for methods that are potentially responsible for processing links and reporting errors by examining the surrounding code in the `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py", "handle")
search_method_in_file("sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py", "process_uri")
search_method_in_file("sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py", "process_result")
```

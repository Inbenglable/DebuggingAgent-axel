To fix the issue, I'll need to identify the location of the `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` classes within the Django codebase. Specifically, I need to check the existing regex in these two validators to determine where the change should be made. Typically, these classes are located in the `contrib.auth.validators` module.

Therefore, I will search for the source code of `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` classes and then locate and verify their regex patterns.

Since the file path is not specified, I'll need to search for both classes in the codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ASCIIUsernameValidator")
search_class_in_codebase("UnicodeUsernameValidator")
```

To address the issue, it's essential to first obtain the source code for the `PythonCodePrinter` class, specifically the `_print_Function` method. This will help ensure that the addition of the `_print_Min` and `_print_Max` methods aligns correctly within the existing functionality. Once I have the existing source code, I can generate the appropriate patch.

```python
search_class_in_file("sympy/printing/pycode.py", "PythonCodePrinter")
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/pycode.py", "PythonCodePrinter._print_Function")
```

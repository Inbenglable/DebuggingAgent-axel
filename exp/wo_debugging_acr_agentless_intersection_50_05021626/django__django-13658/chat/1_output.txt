To resolve the issue, I need to modify the `ManagementUtility` class and specifically adjust the instantiation of `CommandParser` to use `self.prog_name` instead of the default derived from `sys.argv`. I need to retrieve and review the source code for the `ManagementUtility` class to locate the relevant section and ensure an accurate patch. I will search for the `ManagementUtility` class in the codebase to achieve this.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ManagementUtility")
```

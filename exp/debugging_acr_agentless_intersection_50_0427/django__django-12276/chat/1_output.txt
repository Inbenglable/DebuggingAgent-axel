To resolve the issue regarding the incorrect display of the 'required' attribute when initial data exists for a file field, we need to examine the behavior of the `use_required_attribute()` method in the Django codebase. The user suggests changing its location from `ClearableFileInput` to `FileInput`.

We need to analyze the implementation of `use_required_attribute()` in the `ClearableFileInput` class within the file `django/forms/widgets.py`. This method is likely responsible for determining if the 'required' attribute should be added to a file input element even when initial data is provided.

Let's observe the method:

Observed method: `django/forms/widgets.py:ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute`

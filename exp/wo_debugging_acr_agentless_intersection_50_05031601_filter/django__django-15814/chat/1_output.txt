To resolve the issue, I need to examine the implementation of the line `opts = cur_model._meta` within the file `django/db/models/sql/query.py`. This involves retrieving the surrounding source code of this snippet specifically at line 745 to see how the current model options are being set and how they might relate to proxy models.

I'll use the API to retrieve the code surrounding this snippet to identify the potential fix.

```python
search_code_in_file("django/db/models/sql/query.py", "opts = cur_model._meta")
```

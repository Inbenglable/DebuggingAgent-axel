To address the issue, I need to locate and modify the source code of the `ModelBackend.authenticate` method so that it doesn't perform unnecessary database queries when `username` or `password` is `None`. Additionally, since the debugging history mentions an issue in a test function (`test_auth_with_none_credentials_minimal`) with `queries_log_disabled`, the test also likely needs some adjustments.

First, I need to find the source code for `ModelBackend.authenticate` to implement the changes and review the test function for further changes if needed.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("ModelBackend.authenticate")
search_method_in_codebase("test_auth_with_none_credentials_minimal")
```

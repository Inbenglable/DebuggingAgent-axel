To address the issue, I need to review the source code for the method `check_excessive_operations`, which is responsible for detecting excessive index operations in migrations. This will allow me to understand how the detection is currently implemented and how I might modify it to optimize migration operations.

Since the debugging history indicates that the method `check_excessive_operations` is located in `reproduce.py`, I will search for this method within that file.

```python
search_method_in_file("reproduce.py", "check_excessive_operations")
```

Based on the information provided, here's the analysis of the patch and test output:

1. **Analysis of the Patch**: 
   - The patch introduces an additional check for `has_add_permission` in the definition of `show_save_as_new`. This aligns with the suggestion from the bug report and ensures that the "Save as new" option is only shown if the user has both change and add permissions.

2. **Test Output Before Applying the Patch**:
   - Test case 1 fails: "'Save as new' is shown even without add permission." This indicates that the original code does not correctly enforce permission checks for the "Save as new" option.
   - Test cases 2 and 3 pass, meaning these conditions were already handled correctly by the original code.

3. **Test Output After Applying the Patch**:
   - All test cases pass, indicating that the patch has successfully addressed the permission issue.
   - Specifically, Test case 1 now passes: "'Save as new' is correctly hidden when the user lacks add permission," which demonstrates that the permission check for `has_add_permission` is now correctly enforced.

Given that the patch introduces the necessary permission check and the test behavior before and after the patch confirms the issue's resolution, the conclusion is:

Issue resolved: `True`

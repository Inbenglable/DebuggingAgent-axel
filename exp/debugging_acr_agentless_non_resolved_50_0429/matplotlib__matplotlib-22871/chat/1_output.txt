Analyzing the issue, it's clear that the problem with `ConciseDateFormatter` not showing the year when plotting dates less than 12 months is linked with how the `ConciseDateFormatter` manages the display of offsets on the x-axis.

Given the context, the issue likely resides in `matplotlib.dates` where the `ConciseDateFormatter` logic is implemented. Specifically, the method responsible for formatting date strings and managing offsets for different ranges might need adjustment for cases where the plotted time span does not include January.

Before locating the exact buggy method, the exploration should focus on understanding how the `ConciseDateFormatter` calculates and determines which date components to display as offsets on the x-axis.

The most relevant method for observation would be in the `ConciseDateFormatter` class within `matplotlib.dates`, which handles how labels are computed and displayed.

Therefore, I will continue tracing by selecting the method responsible for the date formatting logic in the `ConciseDateFormatter`.

Observed method: `lib/matplotlib/dates.py:ConciseDateFormatter.format_ticks`

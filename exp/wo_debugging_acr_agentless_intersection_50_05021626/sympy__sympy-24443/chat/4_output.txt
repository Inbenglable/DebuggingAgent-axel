To address the issue mentioned, I need to explore the `_check_homomorphism` function and understand its logic, focusing especially on how it handles PermutationGroups. I need to verify that the logic correctly accounts for inverted generators as described.

Since the `_check_homomorphism` function is likely involved in examining group homomorphism properties, it might be part of a related class handling combinatoric or group operations, given the file path in the issue description. I'll need to examine the file `sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py`.

Let's begin by searching for the `_check_homomorphism` method to review its implementation:

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py", "_check_homomorphism")
```

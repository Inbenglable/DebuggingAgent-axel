Analyzing the current situation, we encounter an error message when attempting to run tests, specifically an `AssertionError` within the `pysnooper` tracing setup. This is unrelated to the core program being debugged and instead indicates a fault in the debugging or test framework setup, particularly in locating the file path for tracing.

In terms of the main program logic relevant to our issue, we're zeroing in on lines within the `Basic.subs` method in `sympy/core/basic.py`:

```python
947   rv = self
948   for old, new in sequence:
949       rv = rv._subs(old, new, **kwargs)
```

Here, the key operation is the loop iterating over substitution pairs, applying each old-new substitution pair using the private method `_subs()`, which is where symbolic calculations and handling of special forms like `Piecewise` would delve deeper.

The `PolynomialError` being raised suggests that within this process, somehow a polynomial-related operation is being incorrectly applied to a `Piecewise` expression, potentially due to some assumption mismatches or erroneous expression simplification/handling logic deeper inside `_subs()` or any subsequent logic interacting with it.

Thus, the next logical step involves inspecting the `_subs()` method itself, as it's directly responsible for executing changes during substitution and is likely where the error in managing `Piecewise` expressions originates.

Observed method: `sympy/core/basic.py:Basic._subs`

To fix the `UnboundLocalError` issue caused by the uninitialized `substitutions` variable when `max_post_process_passes` is set to 0, I will introduce a default initialization to the variable before it is used in the conditional check. This ensures that the variable is always initialized, even if the loop is not entered.

### Here's the patch for the issue:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        yield from super().post_process(*args, **kwargs)\n=======\n        substitutions = []\n        yield from super().post_process(*args, **kwargs)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch ensures that `substitutions` is initialized to an empty list prior to its usage in any conditional statements or subsequent logic, thereby preventing `UnboundLocalError` when the loop is not entered.

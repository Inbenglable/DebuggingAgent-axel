To resolve the issue, we need to modify the behavior of the `get_feature_names` method in the `CountVectorizer` class so that it does not raise a `NotFittedError` when a vocabulary is provided but the vectorizer hasn't been trained. Before generating the patch, we need to retrieve the source code for the `get_feature_names` method within the `CountVectorizer` class to understand its current implementation and make necessary alterations.

Since we do not have the file path yet, we should search for the `get_feature_names` method in the codebase to locate the relevant file and gain access to the method's implementation. 

Here's the search API call we need:

```python
search_method_in_codebase("CountVectorizer.get_feature_names")
```

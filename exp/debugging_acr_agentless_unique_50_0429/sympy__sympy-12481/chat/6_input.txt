## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
`Permutation` constructor fails with non-disjoint cycles
Calling `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` raises a `ValueError` instead of constructing the identity permutation.  If the cycles passed in are non-disjoint, they should be applied in left-to-right order and the resulting permutation should be returned.

This should be easy to compute.  I don't see a reason why non-disjoint cycles should be forbidden.

</ISSUE>


A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
Based on the test execution output and traceback provided, the problem arises during the instantiation of the `Permutation` object: specifically when calling the `__new__` method of the `Permutation` class with `args` set to `[[0, 1], [0, 1]]`.

The `ValueError` is raised because the `__new__` method detects repeating elements within the cycles, which it currently interprets as invalid input. The intention behind the raising of the error seems to be enforcing disjoint underlying cycles, but the reported issue suggests that non-disjoint cycles should be allowed and their effect compounded left-to-right to form the identity permutation when possible.

To further explore the precise logic that leads to the exception, I would focus on examining the handling of `args` within the `__new__` method, specifically where it assesses cycle validity. As the exception is thrown from line 900, let's inspect the related method further.

Observed method: `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py:Permutation.__new__`
==================================================
The issue seems to originate from the logic within the `Permutation.__new__` method, specifically in how it handles cycle detection and management. When the cycles are not disjoint, the current implementation raises a `ValueError` (as seen in line 900 and line 901 of sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py). The issue report suggests that instead of throwing an exception, the permutation should respect the cycle notation's order and create the resultant permutation. However, line 900 is currently enforcing disjoint elements by raising a `ValueError` when duplicates are detected.

The relevant section of the code causing the problem is:

```python
if has_dups(temp):
    if is_cycle:
        raise ValueError('there were repeated elements; to resolve '
        'cycles use Cycle%s.' % ''.join([str(tuple(c)) for c in args]))
    else:
        raise ValueError('there were repeated elements.')
```

To verify the hypothesis and pinpoint the exact problem, observe the lines directly handling cycle formation and redundancy checks, particularly lines 897-917.

Observed scope: `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py:897-917`
==================================================
To resolve the issue, I will analyze the current observed anomalous program behavior:

The `Permutation.__new__` method is designed to create a new Permutation object using cycle notation. However, the code in lines 897-917 raises a `ValueError` when duplicate elements are found, which enforces the use of disjoint cycles. The key lines are:

```python
897         temp = flatten(args)
898         if has_dups(temp):
899             if is_cycle:
900                 raise ValueError('there were repeated elements; to resolve '
901                 'cycles use Cycle%s.' % ''.join([str(tuple(c)) for c in args]))
902             else:
903                 raise ValueError('there were repeated elements.')
```

The code checks for duplicate elements using `has_dups`. If duplicates are found, it raises a `ValueError`, preventing the creation of the Permutation object. This logic is problematic when handling non-disjoint cycles, as reported in the issue.

Instead of raising an error, the method should instead apply non-disjoint cycles in left-to-right order, meaning the cycles should be applied sequentially to create the resulting permutation. 

Given the description and current observation, it appears that the `__new__` method in `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` is indeed the buggy method that needs to be fixed.

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue, I'll need to review the complete source code of the `__new__` method within the `Permutation` class in the `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` file. This will allow me to fully understand the current implementation, especially how cycles are being processed and where the modifications should be made to handle non-disjoint cycles correctly.

I'll use the following search API to retrieve the method:

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py", "Permutation.__new__")
```

Your API invoke result:

        Examples
        ========

        >>> from sympy.combinatorics.permutations import Permutation
        >>> Permutation.print_cyclic = False

        Permutations entered in array-form are left unaltered:

        >>> Permutation([0, 2, 1])
        Permutation([0, 2, 1])

        Permutations entered in cyclic form are converted to array form;
        singletons need not be entered, but can be entered to indicate the
        largest element:

        >>> Permutation([[4, 5, 6], [0, 1]])
        Permutation([1, 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 4])
        >>> Permutation([[4, 5, 6], [0, 1], [19]])
        Permutation([1, 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 4], size=20)

        All manipulation of permutations assumes that the smallest element
        is 0 (in keeping with 0-based indexing in Python) so if the 0 is
        missing when entering a permutation in array form, an error will be
        raised:

        >>> Permutation([2, 1])
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ValueError: Integers 0 through 2 must be present.

        If a permutation is entered in cyclic form, it can be entered without
        singletons and the ``size`` specified so those values can be filled
        in, otherwise the array form will only extend to the maximum value
        in the cycles:

        >>> Permutation([[1, 4], [3, 5, 2]], size=10)
        Permutation([0, 4, 3, 5, 1, 2], size=10)
        >>> _.array_form
        [0, 4, 3, 5, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9]

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

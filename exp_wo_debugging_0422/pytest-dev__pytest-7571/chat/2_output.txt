To resolve the issue, I need to examine the implementation details of the `LogCaptureFixture` class, which seems to be responsible for managing log capture in the `caplog` fixture. I need to investigate how it handles setting and restoring log levels. More specifically, I should look for methods in `LogCaptureFixture` related to setting and restoring log levels.

To begin with, I will search for the `LogCaptureFixture` class in the codebase to review its source code and understand its behavior regarding log level management.

```python
search_class_in_file("src/_pytest/logging.py", "LogCaptureFixture")
```

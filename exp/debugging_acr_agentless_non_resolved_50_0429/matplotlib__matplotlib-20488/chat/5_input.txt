### Bug report

`lib/matplotlib/tests/test_image.py::test_huge_range_log` is failing quite a few of the CI runs with a Value Error.  

I cannot reproduce locally, so I assume there was a numpy change somewhere...

This test came in #18458

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import colors

# Create test data with extreme values
data = np.full((5, 5), -1, dtype=np.float64)
data[0:2, :] = 1E20  # Very large values

# Create figure and plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
norm = colors.LogNorm(vmin=100, vmax=data.max())
im = ax.imshow(data, norm=norm, interpolation='nearest', cmap='viridis')
plt.show()


This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
The failure in the test case `test_huge_range_log` is due to a `ValueError` indicating "Invalid vmin or vmax" in the `LogNorm.__call__()` method. This error typically arises when either `vmin` or `vmax` results in non-finite values after applying the logarithmic transformation.

Upon examining the test data and the usage of `LogNorm`, it's clear that the vmin (`100`) and vmax (`1e+20`) are not an issue, yet the presence of very large positive values (`1e+20`) and negative values (`-1`) in the data can potentially cause issues when transforming these data values through a logarithmic scale.

The `LogNorm` class uses a logarithmic scale that typically excludes non-positive values (`vmin` and transformed non-positive data values), causing issues if not properly handled or masked.

The traceback indicates that the error occurs after the `autoscale_None(value)` which sets the scale limits by calling `self._trf.transform([self.vmin, self.vmax])`.  
Therefore, this demonstrates a logic or handling issue in signing off when logarithmic transformations yield non-finite results.

Let's trace the `LogNorm.__call__()` method in the `lib/matplotlib/colors.py` to identify the root cause.

Observed method: `lib/matplotlib/colors.py:LogNorm.__call__`
==================================================
To address the issue with `test_huge_range_log`, we should focus on the `LogNorm.__call__()` method in `lib/matplotlib/colors.py`. This is where the error is triggered due to invalid `vmin` or `vmax`. Given that `NoNorm.__call__()` simply returns the input value without any processing or normalization, it is unlikely to be directly involved in the root cause of the issue.

The error arises when `LogNorm` encounters extreme values that cannot be processed correctly. The problematic line is where the logarithm transformation of `vmin` and `vmax` occurs, and this is where non-finite results can emerge if the input values include impossible-to-transform numbers (negative or zero).

Thus, I should trace deeper into the `LogNorm.__call__()` method to identify exactly where and why the logarithm transformation is failing. 

Observed scope: `lib/matplotlib/colors.py:1468-1480`

This will focus on capturing the specific lines of code involved in applying the transformation and checking the finiteness of `t_vmin` and `t_vmax`.
==================================================
The failure in the `test_huge_range_log` is due to the handling of extreme values by the `LogNorm` class, particularly in the `LogNorm.__call__()` method within `lib/matplotlib/colors.py`. The crucial part of the method is where transformations are applied to `vmin` and `vmax` using a logarithmic function, which can result in non-finite (infinite or NaN) values, triggering the `ValueError`.

Analyzing the snippet of `LogNorm.__call__()`, the lines of interest are:
- Line 1474: Transformation of input values, possibly containing extreme or non-positive numbers, into a logarithmic space using `self._trf.transform`.
- Line 1475: Specifically transforming `vmin` and `vmax`, which should be valid finite numbers but may not be if inappropriate values such as negative numbers or zeros are present.
- Line 1476: Check if the transformed `vmin` and `vmax` are finite; if not, an error is raised, revealing the root of the issue in improper preprocessing or handling before transformation.

The problematic behavior seems linked to inappropriate `vmin` or `vmax` values after logarithmic transformations. Overall, it's clear the transformation is failing when fed negative inputs or zeros due to the inherent behavior of logarithms.

Given this analysis, I suspect the issue mainly resides here, especially considering the test inputs contain `-1` and `1E20` values. However, I'll need to ensure that all these inputs are properly filtered or managed before applying `LogNorm`.

Before fixing, I must confirm if there's any existing handling of such problematic inputs before this transformation step within `LogNorm`. Therefore, letâ€™s trace any prior steps in this method that deal with data or parameters before engaging logarithmic transformations.

Observed method: `lib/matplotlib/colors.py:LogNorm.process_value`
==================================================
The `Normalize.process_value` method is designed to homogenize the input values for normalization by converting them into a masked array, which seems to be crucial for handling inputs that potentially contain very large or non-positive values (like the random values or `-1`). However, the `LogNorm.__call__` method where the error occurs doesn't seem to error-proof these extreme or non-positive values before applying the logarithmic transformation.

### Analysis of the `process_value` method:
- **Lines 1152-1154**: If the value is scalar, it is wrapped into a sequence.
- **Lines 1155-1158**: Ensures the datatype is appropriate for processing, especially converting integer and boolean types to float types, ensuring numerical precision.
- **Line 1161**: Extracts any mask applied to the values, indicating areas where the data should be treated as invalid or irrelevant.
- **Lines 1162-1163**: Constructs a masked array with a specific dtype that was determined earlier, preserving the input's shape and handling of masked elements.

The method produces a masked array from the input values, providing robustness against inappropriate or extreme values by implementing data type conversion and possible masking. This preprocessing is essential for managing numerical operations but does not address the possible non-positive values that can break the logarithmic transformation.

### Abnormal Behavior:
The transformation step in `LogNorm.__call__()` converts `vmin` and `vmax` to non-finite values when they include non-positive numbers or zeros from the test data, which happens when `process_value()` returns arrays containing elements that cannot be logarithmically transformed directly. Given the Value Error's triggers in `LogNorm`, the problem stems from not properly addressing non-positive or extreme values beforehand.

### Conclusion:
While `process_value` adequately prepares input for typical normalization processes, it doesn't preclude values or structural configurations leading to invalid log-transform operations. Hence, this confirms further corrective logic or masking is needed elsewhere to gracefully handle inputs containing adverse values like zeros or negatives before hitting transformation logic.

Since this method doesn't directly contain the bug, let's continue with the suspicious range affecting log transformations.

Observed scope: `lib/matplotlib/colors.py:1468-1480` 

Next, I should trace these lines within the `LogNorm.__call__()` for deeper insights into where improper handling might lead to non-finite transformation outcomes.

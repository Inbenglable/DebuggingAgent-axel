To resolve the issue in the Django project, we need to patch the `timesince` function in the relevant file. The issue description points to a specific location in the file `django/utils/timesince.py` between lines 93 and 100. To generate the patch, we need the source code of the `timesince` method located in this file.

Let's search for the `timesince` method in `django/utils/timesince.py`.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/utils/timesince.py", "timesince")
```

To generate a patch for this issue, I need to review the source code of the `method_decorator`, `_multi_decorate`, and possibly other relevant parts in `django/utils/decorators.py`. This will help ensure I understand how these components interact and where the attribute preservation can be improved. I need to retrieve the source code for these methods to proceed.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/utils/decorators.py", "method_decorator")
search_method_in_file("django/utils/decorators.py", "_multi_decorate")
```

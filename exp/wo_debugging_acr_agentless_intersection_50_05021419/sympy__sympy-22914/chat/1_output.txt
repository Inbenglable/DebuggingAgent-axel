To resolve this issue, I need to locate the `PythonCodePrinter` class in the sympy project to apply the patch. Specifically, I will look for the file where the `PythonCodePrinter` class is defined so I can add the `_print_Min` and `_print_Max` methods to it.

I'll start by searching for the `PythonCodePrinter` class in the codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("PythonCodePrinter")
```

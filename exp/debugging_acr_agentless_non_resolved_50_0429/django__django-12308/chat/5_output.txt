To create a fix for the issue, we need to modify the `display_for_field` function to handle `JSONField` differently when the field is read-only. We should inspect the `JSONField` type to determine the proper method of formatting the value. For this, let's retrieve the code for `prepare_value` method from `django/db/models/fields/json.py`, which can help us understand how JSON is typically prepared for display. This will allow us to potentially call this method within `display_for_field`.

Thus, I need to first get the source code of `prepare_value` to understand how to use it in formatting the JSON properly.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/fields/json.py", "prepare_value")
```

To resolve the issue, I need to fully understand the `unapply_migration` method and ensure that the squashed migration is marked as unapplied correctly. I have already obtained the source code for the `unapply_migration` method. Additionally, I need to look into how the squashed migrations are recorded and applied within the `MigrationExecutor`. This might require inspecting the `MigrationRecorder` class, which is responsible for recording migration statuses.

Let's retrieve the source code for the `MigrationRecorder` class.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("MigrationRecorder")
```

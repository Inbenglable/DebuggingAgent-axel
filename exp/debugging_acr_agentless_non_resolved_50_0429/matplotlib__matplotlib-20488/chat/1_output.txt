The failure in the test case `test_huge_range_log` is due to a `ValueError` indicating "Invalid vmin or vmax" in the `LogNorm.__call__()` method. This error typically arises when either `vmin` or `vmax` results in non-finite values after applying the logarithmic transformation.

Upon examining the test data and the usage of `LogNorm`, it's clear that the vmin (`100`) and vmax (`1e+20`) are not an issue, yet the presence of very large positive values (`1e+20`) and negative values (`-1`) in the data can potentially cause issues when transforming these data values through a logarithmic scale.

The `LogNorm` class uses a logarithmic scale that typically excludes non-positive values (`vmin` and transformed non-positive data values), causing issues if not properly handled or masked.

The traceback indicates that the error occurs after the `autoscale_None(value)` which sets the scale limits by calling `self._trf.transform([self.vmin, self.vmax])`.  
Therefore, this demonstrates a logic or handling issue in signing off when logarithmic transformations yield non-finite results.

Let's trace the `LogNorm.__call__()` method in the `lib/matplotlib/colors.py` to identify the root cause.

Observed method: `lib/matplotlib/colors.py:LogNorm.__call__`

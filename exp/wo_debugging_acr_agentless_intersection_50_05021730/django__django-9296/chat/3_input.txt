Now You need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Paginator just implement the __iter__ function
Description
	 
		(last modified by Alex Gaynor)
	 
Right now, when you want to iter into all the pages of a Paginator object you to use the page_range function. It would be more logical and naturel to use the normal python of doing that by implementing the iter function like that:
def __iter__(self):
	for page_num in self.page_range:
		yield self.page(page_num)

</ISSUE>


You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue, I need to assess the existing implementation of the `Paginator` class. Specifically, I need to locate the `Paginator` class in the codebase to access its current functionality. This will allow me to add the `__iter__` method as described in the issue. Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code for the `Paginator` class.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Paginator")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_class_in_codebase("Paginator")
RESULT:
#### django/core/paginator.py:Paginator
```python
class Paginator:

    def __init__(self, object_list, per_page, orphans=0,
        ...

    def validate_number(self, number):
        ...

    def get_page(self, number):
        ...

    def page(self, number):
        ...

    def _get_page(self, *args, **kwargs):
        ...

    @cached_property
    def count(self):
        ...

    @cached_property
    def num_pages(self):
        ...

    @property
    def page_range(self):
        ...

    def _check_object_list_is_ordered(self):
        ...
```


==================================================

Your Output:
I have identified the necessary class (`Paginator`) where the `__iter__` method needs to be added. I don't need to retrieve any additional source code to implement the new method as described in the issue. I am ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

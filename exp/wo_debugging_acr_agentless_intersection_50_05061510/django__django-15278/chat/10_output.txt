The provided patch modifies the `add_field` method in the `SQLiteSchemaEditor` within Django, specifically targeting the addition of `OneToOneField` with a unique constraint. The patch handles SQLite's limitation by remaking the table when a field is nullable, unique, or has a default value.

**Analysis of Test Output:**

1. **Original Test Output:**  
   The test output before applying the patch shows an `AttributeError` indicating that `migrations.OneToOneField` is not a valid attribute, suggesting a mistake in the test setup rather than verifying the actual issue.

2. **Patched Test Output:**   
   The test output after applying the patch remains unchanged, displaying the same `AttributeError`. This indicates that the test itself may not be correctly executed or set up to verify the bug fix because it uses an incorrect import (`migrations.OneToOneField` instead of `models.OneToOneField`).

Thus, the issue relating to adding a nullable `OneToOneField` with a unique constraint is not tested due to the error in the test code using `migrations.OneToOneField`. The test setup needs to be corrected to use `models.OneToOneField` to validate the patch effectively.

**Conclusion:**

Given the test output, it cannot be conclusively determined if the patch resolves the SQLite issue because the test does not properly execute due to incorrect attribute usage.

Issue resolved: `False`

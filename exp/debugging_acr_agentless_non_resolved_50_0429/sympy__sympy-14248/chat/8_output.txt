The analysis of the retrieved `_print_Add` method code indicates that it currently handles negative terms by checking if their string representation begins with a negative sign, and relies on insertion of `-` or `+` accordingly. To resolve the issue, we need to adjust this logic to recognize original subtraction operations more accurately for these matrix expressions. 

We are ready to generate the patch for `_print_Add`, incorporating logic to better handle subtraction forms when printing, such that negative terms are properly recognized as parts of subtractions and formatted accordingly, without highlighting the `(-1)` coefficient.

Ready generation: `True`

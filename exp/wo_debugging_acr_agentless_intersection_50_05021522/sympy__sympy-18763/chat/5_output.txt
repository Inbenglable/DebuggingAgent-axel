To address the issue of incorrect LaTeX parenthesization in the `Subs` object, we need to modify the `_print_Subs` method to enforce parentheses around the expression part. This will ensure that the output is correctly formatted even when the expression is complex or involves multiple terms.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* formatted patch:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/printing/latex.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        return r'\\left. %s \\right|_{\\substack{ %s }}' % (latex_expr,\n                                                           latex_subs)\n=======\n        return r'\\left. \\left(%s\\right) \\right|_{\\substack{ %s }}' % (latex_expr, latex_subs)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch adds parentheses around `latex_expr` in the return statement of the `_print_Subs` method, ensuring that the expression is correctly parenthesized in the LaTeX output.

To address the issue of dtype preservation, we might need to make modifications to how the `_wrap_in_pandas_container` handles input data. However, before making changes, it's useful to understand if there are any existing mechanisms for dtype preservation within `sklearn` that could be extended or used. 

I should also verify if any other methods within the same file or related files handle dtypes because these might be relevant for implementing the solution. Thus, a broader context on how data transformation and preservation is managed within scikit-learn would be beneficial.

Let's examine if there are any additional relevant methods or classes available that manage configuration or preservation settings.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/utils/_set_output.py", "_wrap_data_with_container")
search_method_in_file("sklearn/utils/_set_output.py", "_SetOutputMixin")
```

**Patch Review:**

The patch makes the following changes to the `IsolationForest` class in the `sklearn.ensemble.iforest` module:

1. **Addition of warm_start Parameter:**
   - The `warm_start` parameter is added to the `__init__` method of the `IsolationForest` class, with a default value of `False`.
   - This parameter is passed to the `super().__init__()` call to ensure that it is considered during the initialization.
   
2. **Documentation Update:**
   - The patch includes documentation for the `warm_start` parameter within the class docstring. This makes it clear to users what the parameter is used for and aligns its documentation format with other classes like `RandomForestClassifier`.

**Analysis of Test Output:**

- **Original Output:**
  - The test raised a `ValueError` because the `warm_start` parameter was not recognized as a valid parameter for the `IsolationForest` instance. Consequently, the test failed with an assertion error indicating that `warm_start` was not supported as expected.
  
- **Patched Output:**
  - The test output states that the issue is not present, implying that `warm_start` is now recognized and functional. No exceptions were raised, suggesting that the parameter is successfully utilized to fit additional trees to the model without starting a new ensemble each time.

**Conclusion:**

The patch effectively addresses the issue reported by:

- Exposing the `warm_start` parameter in the `IsolationForest` class.
- Ensuring the parameter is utilized in the initialization and subsequent method calls.
- Adding appropriate documentation for clarity and usability.

The updated test output confirms that the `warm_start` parameter works as intended, without raising errors.

**Issue resolved:** `True`

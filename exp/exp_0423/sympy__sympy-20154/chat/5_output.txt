To resolve the issue, I need to review the source code of the `partitions` method in the `sympy/utilities/iterables.py` file. This will allow me to understand how dictionaries are currently being reused and then implement a fix.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/utilities/iterables.py", "partitions")
```

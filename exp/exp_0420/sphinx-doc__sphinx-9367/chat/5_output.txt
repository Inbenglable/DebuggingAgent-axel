To address the issue, I need to inspect the `_UnparseVisitor.visit_Tuple` method's current implementation to ensure a comprehensive understanding of its logic and structure. Before proceeding with the patch, retrieving this specific method's source code is essential. 

Let's proceed with retrieving the source code for this method:

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/pycode/ast.py", "_UnparseVisitor.visit_Tuple")
```

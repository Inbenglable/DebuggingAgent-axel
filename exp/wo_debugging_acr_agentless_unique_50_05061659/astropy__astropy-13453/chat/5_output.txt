The patch has been applied to the `astropy/io/ascii/html.py` file, specifically modifying the `write` method in the HTML table writer. The patch ensures that the `formats` argument is utilized to apply the specified formatting functions to the corresponding columns before outputting the HTML content.

### Patch Review
The change made in the patch is straightforward:

- **Before Patch**: The column values are directly appended to `col_str_iters` without applying any formatting specified by the `formats` argument.
- **After Patch**: A check is added to see if a specific format is provided for a column through `self.data.formats`. If a format function is specified, it is applied using `map()` over the column values, ensuring that the values are formatted before being appended to `col_str_iters`.

### Test Output Analysis
- **Original Output**: The test fails, raising an `AssertionError` indicating that the `formats` argument is ignored for HTML output.
- **Patched Output**: The test passes without any errors, confirming that the formatting specified by the `formats` argument is now respected and applied to HTML output.

Based on the test outputs before and after applying the patch, it is clear that the issue of the `formats` argument being ignored for HTML output is resolved.

Issue resolved: `True`

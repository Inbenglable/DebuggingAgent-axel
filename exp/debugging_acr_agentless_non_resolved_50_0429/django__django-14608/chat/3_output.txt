The traced `formset_factory` method is responsible for creating formset classes with particular attributes. It doesn't deal directly with the validation or rendering logic of errors, which is where the issue lies. Specifically, the current observation suggests that there is missing functionality for adding the 'nonform' CSS class to non-form errors in a `FormSet` ErrorList.

The runtime error message "Non-form errors do not have the 'nonform' CSS class" indicates that the issue is not with how formsets are being created but rather with how errors are being processed and rendered in formsets after validation occurs.

Given that the creation of formsets seems to be executing as expected, we need to investigate deeper into the error-list processing in formsets. This logic is likely within a method associated with formset validation or error handling.

Therefore, observing details in the `BaseFormSet` class, especially around error processing, would be the logical next step. This is where formset error lists are typically manipulated.

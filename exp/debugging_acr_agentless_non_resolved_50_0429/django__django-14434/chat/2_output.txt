Based on the information provided, the issue stems from the `MockDatabaseWrapper.__init__` method, which calls `super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)` but does not provide the necessary `settings_dict` argument required by the `BaseDatabaseWrapper` class.

The `BaseDatabaseWrapper`'s constructor expects `settings_dict` to configure the required database settings, but this argument is missing from the call in the mock subclass.

Given that the issue is related to the incorrect initialization of `MockDatabaseWrapper`, and the traceback confirms it is due to the missing positional argument, the buggy method can be identified as follows:

Buggy method: `reproduce.py:MockDatabaseWrapper.__init__`

To fix the issue, you should ensure that when initializing `MockDatabaseWrapper`, a valid `settings_dict` is passed to the superclass constructor. This can typically be a mock or minimal configuration dictionary sufficient for the logic being tested.

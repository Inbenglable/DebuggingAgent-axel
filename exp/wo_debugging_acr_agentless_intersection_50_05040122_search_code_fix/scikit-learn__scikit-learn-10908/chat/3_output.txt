To address the issue, we need to update the `get_feature_names` method in the `CountVectorizer` class so it does not raise a `NotFittedError` when the vocabulary is provided but the vectorizer has not been explicitly fitted. The solution involves checking if the vocabulary was provided and initializing the `vocabulary_` attribute if it hasn't been done yet. This logic can be checked with the `fixed_vocabulary_` flag while calling `get_feature_names`.

Here are the necessary code modifications:

```pythony
### sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self._check_vocabulary()
=======
        if not hasattr(self, 'vocabulary_') and not self.fixed_vocabulary_:
            self._check_vocabulary()
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, I will provide the JSON representation of this edit:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        self._check_vocabulary()\n=======\n        if not hasattr(self, 'vocabulary_') and not self.fixed_vocabulary_:\n            self._check_vocabulary()\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

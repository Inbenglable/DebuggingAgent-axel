To generate the patch needed to resolve the issue, I have already retrieved the `to_python` and `validate` methods for the `ModelChoiceField` class. These methods include the validation logic that triggers the error message.

Based on this information, I now have all the necessary source code to proceed with generating the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

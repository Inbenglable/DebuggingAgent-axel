The observed issue is that the `tearDown` method of a `unittest.TestCase` is called even for skipped tests when running `pytest` with the `--pdb` option. Normally, when `unittest.skip` is used, the test should be entirely skipped, including the setup and teardown process.

The test with `--pdb` option erroneously executes `tearDown`, which leads to a `NameError` since the placeholder code `xxx` isn't defined. The problem lies in the way `pytest` interacts with `unittest` when the `--pdb` option is enabled.

To trace and locate the code that could potentially cause this behavior, I need to examine how `pytest` handles test execution, especially with `--pdb` and whether it correctly skips the setup and teardown when a test is marked with `unittest.skip()`.

Observed method: `src/_pytest/debugging.py:pytestPDB._enter_pdb`

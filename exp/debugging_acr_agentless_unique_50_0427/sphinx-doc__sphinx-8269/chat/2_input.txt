## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Linkcheck should report HTTP errors instead of Anchor not found
**Describe the bug**
The `linkcheck` command always reports that it was unable to find the anchor when [`linkcheck_anchors`](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#confval-linkcheck_workers) is `True`, even when the server replied with an error status code (e.g. 404, 500).

While it is indeed unable to find the anchor, the real issue is that the server encountered an error.

**To Reproduce**
```console
$ sphinx-quickstart --project proj --sep --author me --release 1.0 --language en
$ # https://google.com/test.txt does not exist, the server replies with a 404.
$ echo '\n`foo <https://google.com/test.txt#test>`_' >>source/index.rst
$ make linkcheck
```

**Expected behavior**
*Actual*
```
(line   22) broken    https://google.com/test.txt#test - Anchor 'test' not found
```

*Expected output*
Same as when `linkcheck_anchors=False`.
```
(line   22) broken    https://google.com/test.txt#test - 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://google.com/test.txt
``` 

**Environment info**
- OS: Linux 5.8.12.a-1-hardened
- Python version: 3.8.5
- Sphinx version: 3.2.1

</ISSUE>


A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
The issue here seems to be a `FileNotFoundError`, which indicates that the directory where the configuration file `conf.py` should be written does not exist. The script attempts to create and write to the `conf.py` file in the directory `/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/sphinx-doc__sphinx-8269/source`, but it encounters an error because the `source` directory has not been created beforehand.

To resolve this issue:

1. Ensure that the necessary directories are created before attempting to write files into them.
2. Verify the existence of the path where the file is to be created, and if it doesn't exist, create it.

Given the provided output and context, the error occurred at the point where the script tried to open `conf.py` for writing, but the directory did not exist. This suggests that the issue lies within the `setup_sphinx_app()` method.

Buggy method: `reproduce.py:setup_sphinx_app`
==================================================


Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

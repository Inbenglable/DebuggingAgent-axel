To resolve the issue where autodoc is ignoring an empty `__all__` attribute, I need to find the relevant code in the Sphinx project where autodoc handles the `__all__` attribute. Typically, autodoc is associated with modules or classes that handle documentation generation, such as classes or methods within `sphinx.ext.autodoc`.

I'll start by searching for methods related to `__all__` handling within the autodoc extension. Often, these are part of module or class methods that check module attributes.

To begin, I need to search for strings or methods involving `__all__` within the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` folder. Therefore, I will start with a search for potentially relevant methods in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("__all__")
search_class_in_codebase("autodoc")
```

To resolve this issue, I will need to examine how management commands are currently implemented in the Django project. Specifically, I need to look at how options are defined and processed within these commands in order to introduce the `--skip-checks` option. Typically, management commands are implemented extending Djangoâ€™s `BaseCommand` or with custom command classes.

First, I'll search for `BaseCommand` class, where options for management commands are usually defined and handled. 

```python
search_class_in_codebase("BaseCommand")
```

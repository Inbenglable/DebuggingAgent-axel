To resolve the issue mentioned, I need to review the code of the `_check_homomorphism` and `_image` functions to understand their current implementation and pinpoint where the handling of permutations, especially inverted generators, is going wrong. As these functions are part of the `homomorphisms.py` file in the `sympy` project, I need to retrieve the source code for these methods. 

I'll search for the `_check_homomorphism` method and try to gather the relevant code around the `_image` function.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py", "_check_homomorphism")
search_code_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py", "_image")
```

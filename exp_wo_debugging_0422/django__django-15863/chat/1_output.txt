To resolve the issue, I need to examine the source code of the `floatformat` template filter to understand how it handles the conversion between float and Decimal values. Since the description of the issue suggests that the problem lies in the `floatformat` template filter implementation, I will search for the `floatformat` method in the Django codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("floatformat")
```

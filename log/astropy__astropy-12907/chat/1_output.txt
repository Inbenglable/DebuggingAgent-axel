To generate a minimal debugging test, we need to focus on reproducing the issue with the nested compound models in a concise manner. The debugging test will aim to isolate the issue by specifically testing the separability_matrix function with nested models.

Here's how we can structure the debugging test:

```python
{
    "debugging_test": "from astropy.modeling import models as m\nfrom astropy.modeling.separable import separability_matrix\n\n# Minimal debugging test focusing on nested compound model issue\nnested_cm = m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & (m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5))\nprint(separability_matrix(nested_cm))"
}
```

This test specifically targets the scenario described in Test 3, where a nested compound model is used. By focusing on just this element, we can better analyze runtime information and monitor the behavior of the `separability_matrix` computation for nested compound models.

To resolve the issue, I need to locate and examine the source code related to the `quantity_input` decorator. Specifically, the error message points to an issue within the decorator implementation where it's assuming the return value supports unit conversion. Therefore, I'll need to analyze the code in the files mentioned in the error stack trace to understand the behavior around return type processing.

First, I'll search for the `quantity_input` decorator itself within the codebase. This should give insights into what the decorator is doing and where it might be incorrectly handling the return type.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("quantity_input")
search_code_in_codebase("return_.to(wrapped_signature.return_annotation)")
```

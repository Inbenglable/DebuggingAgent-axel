To address the issue of incorrect indexing with parentheses for properties, I will need to modify the `PyFunction.add_target_and_index` method. This will ensure that when the `:property:` option is utilized, no parentheses are added.

I have already obtained the current source code for this method. Thus, I am ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

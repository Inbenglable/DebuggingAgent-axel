To resolve the issue, I need to examine more closely how the `filter_members` method processes module members with respect to the `__all__` attribute. I suspect that the handling of empty `__all__` lists might be addressed within this method or nearby, particularly in relation to the `options.members` setting. 

To proceed, I will retrieve the source code of the `Documenter.filter_members` method.

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py", "Documenter.filter_members")
```

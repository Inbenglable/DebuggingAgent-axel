To determine whether the issue is resolved, let's break down the information given:

1. **Issue Description**:
   - The problem occurs when processing docstrings where the first line is not empty.
   - Error occurs due to the way indentation is calculated in the `trim_docstring` function.

2. **Reproduce Test**:
   - A test function has been provided which simulates the environment where the bug can be reproduced. Specifically, it checks if an exception is raised when processing a non-empty first line docstring.

3. **Original Test Output**:
   - The test outputs an `ImportError` for `simplify_exception`, indicating that the test setup is incorrect or incomplete, preventing us from seeing the intended error related to docstring processing.

4. **Patch**:
   - The proposed patch modifies the `trim_docstring` function by updating the indentation calculation logic to start from the second line (`lines[1:]`), thus addressing the mentioned issue.

5. **Patched Test Output**:
   - The test output remains the same after applying the patch, still showing an `ImportError`.

**Analysis**:
The key issue here is that both the original and patched outputs show an `ImportError` which prevents the test from running the code path related to the actual issue mentioned (docstring processing). This error needs to be resolved before a conclusion about the functionality of the patch can be made. The error pertains to an import, which suggests that either the test environment is not correctly set up or the module `simplify_exception` does not exist or is mis-specified.

However, the patch itself accurately reflects the solution proposed in the issue. But because the construction for testing is flawed (due to import error), it's currently impossible to conclusively verify that the patch resolves the intended issue within the existing testing setup. 

**Conclusion**:
The failure occurs at a point that isn't related to the initial bug issue regarding docstring processing. Therefore, while the patch might theoretically resolve the indentation issue itself, the test framework does not demonstrate this due to separate unrelated errors.

Issue resolved: `False` - due to inability to verify with the current test setup.

Based on the analysis and the observed behavior, we understand that the issue is arising because the `vocabulary_` attribute is not being set when the `vocabulary` parameter is provided during initialization of `CountVectorizer`. The `_check_vocabulary` method is called by `get_feature_names` and checks whether the `vocabulary_` attribute is set, which fails and raises a `NotFittedError`.

This indicates that the problem lies in the process of linking the `vocabulary` parameter to the `vocabulary_` attribute without requiring an explicit call like `transform`. The initialization or validation method should handle this linkage but currently does not.

Let's continue tracing by selecting the method that handles vocabulary validation or setting in the `CountVectorizer` class, which is `_validate_vocabulary`.

Observed method: `sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py:VectorizerMixin._validate_vocabulary`

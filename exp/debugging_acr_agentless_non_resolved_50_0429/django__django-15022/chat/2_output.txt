The error "Apps aren't loaded yet" occurs because the Django app registry has not been fully initialized before attempting to run the migration command with `call_command('migrate', verbosity=0)`. This initialization is typically managed by Django when using standard tools like the manage.py script, server, or tests.

Here is what we observe:

- The error occurs inside the `check_apps_ready` method of the `Apps` class located in `django/apps/registry.py`.
- The crucial point of failure is when `self.check_apps_ready()` gets called, and it determines that `self.apps_ready` is `False`, leading to an `AppRegistryNotReady` exception being raised.
  
This suggests that the Django application has not yet been fully initialized, and settings have not been properly configured or populated.

To address this, more groundwork is necessary to properly initialize the Django application before executing database operations, especially within the context of a script run outside the Django management tools.

The issue is not directly with this method but with how we have set up the testing environment. The missing initialization steps prior to the migration command need to be identified.

Given that analysis, I need to examine the section in the testing script where the Django environment and the settings configuration occur. Here is the primary scope to observe:

Observed scope: `django/core/management/__init__.py:65-105`

To fix the issue with `__in` not clearing selected fields on the RHS when `QuerySet.alias()` is used after `annotate()`, I should investigate the `_annotate` method within the `QuerySet` class. The methods `annotate` and `alias` both rely on `_annotate`, but with different `select` parameters, so it's crucial to understand how it handles the addition of these fields and why it doesn't properly prune after aliasing.

I will retrieve the source code of the `_annotate` method in the `QuerySet` class to analyze it and generate the necessary fix.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/query.py", "_annotate")
```

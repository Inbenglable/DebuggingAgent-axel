To resolve the issue, we need to understand how SymPy handles the comparison between symbolic representations, particularly `S.false`, `S(0)`, and `S(0.0)`. This likely involves the `__eq__` method within the classes that define these objects, possibly located in core or logic modules. 

Let's start by searching for the implementation details related to these symbolic representations. We'll start by gathering source code around these entities, particularly focusing on methods responsible for equality comparison.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("S.false.__eq__")
search_method_in_codebase("S.__eq__")
search_method_in_codebase("__eq__")
```

To create a patch that can resolve this issue, I should review the `Dagger` class implementation specifically for any overrides in multiplication operations that might involve the interaction with `IdentityOperator`.

The `Dagger` class likely needs to have a check when multiplied with `IdentityOperator` so that the result simplifies to `Dagger(Operator)`, similar to how an `Operator` simplifies when multiplied by `IdentityOperator`.

I need to search for methods in `Dagger` that may involve multiplication logic. This likely involves overriding the `__mul__` or `_eval_multiplication` method.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/physics/quantum/dagger.py", "Dagger.__mul__")
search_method_in_file("sympy/physics/quantum/dagger.py", "Dagger._eval_multiplication")
```

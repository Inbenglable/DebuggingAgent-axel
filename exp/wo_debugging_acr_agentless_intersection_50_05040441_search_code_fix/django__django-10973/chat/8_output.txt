To determine if the issue is resolved, let's analyze the situation:

### Original Issue
- The original code uses `subprocess.check_call` to run a subprocess for `psql`, which does not handle the `PGPASSWORD` environment variable to avoid exposing the password in the command line. This can lead to potential security risks and issues, especially with complex passwords containing special characters.

### Reproduce Test
- The test tries to execute the `runshell_db` method with connection parameters that include a complex password.
- The original test output indicates a `FileNotFoundError` for `psql`, suggesting that the command `psql` could not be found or executed on the environment.

### Patch Analysis
- The patch involves replacing `subprocess.check_call` with `subprocess.run` while adding `PGPASSWORD` directly to the environment variable of the subprocess, ensuring a more secure way of passing the password and simplifying the command execution.

### Patched Test Result
- After applying this patch, the test output remains the same with a `FileNotFoundError` for `psql`. This indicates that the issue is not with the handling of the password or subprocess management but possibly with the environment not having `psql` installed or accessible.

### Conclusion
- The reported problem related to securely passing the password seems to be addressed by the patch, as using an environment variable would effectively handle complex passwords without exposing them in command lines or other security pitfalls associated with temporary files.
- However, the `FileNotFoundError` indicates a separate issue with `psql` not being available, which was present before and remains after the patch. This is unrelated to the original issue concerning subprocess management and password handling.

Therefore, in terms of the original issue about using `subprocess.run` and handling passwords through environment variables, the patch correctly addresses the issue. However, for the test to succeed, the environment must have `psql` correctly installed and available.

Issue resolved: `True`

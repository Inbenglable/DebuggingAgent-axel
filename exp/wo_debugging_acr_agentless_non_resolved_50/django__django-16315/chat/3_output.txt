To address the issue of handling `db_column` names correctly in the `bulk_create` method, I need to understand how the `_insert` method is implemented, as it is responsible for constructing the SQL statements used in `bulk_create`, including the `ON CONFLICT` clause. This will likely provide insight into how column names are being used in constructing SQL which causes the issue mentioned.

Therefore, I will retrieve the `_insert` method source code.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/query.py", "_insert")
```

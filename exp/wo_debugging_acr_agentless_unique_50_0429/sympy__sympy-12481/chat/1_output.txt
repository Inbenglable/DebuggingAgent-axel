To resolve the issue with the `Permutation` constructor handling non-disjoint cycles in the SymPy project, I need to locate the constructor definition for `Permutation` to analyze how it processes the input cycles and why non-disjoint cycles lead to a `ValueError`. This will help me implement a fix to allow the constructor to handle non-disjoint cycles correctly.

Since I need the source code for the `Permutation` class and its constructor, I will search for the `Permutation` class to understand its implementation. I will only search for the class because it is likely that the constructor is defined within this class.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Permutation")
```

Based on the issue description, the problem is related to the `_image` function in the context of permutation groups in the `sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py` file. The results provided are from a different module within the `sympy/polys/agca/homomorphisms.py` file, which deals with module homomorphisms rather than permutation groups. Therefore, these results are likely not relevant to resolving the issue at hand.

Given the focus on permutation groups, the results about module homomorphisms are not related to the `_image` method that is causing the problem in the `sympy/combinatorics` package.

Hence, none of the API returned content appears to be the needed source for this specific issue with permutation groups.

No selections are made since the results are from an unrelated module. Further search narrowing down to the appropriate module, file, and context could be necessary.

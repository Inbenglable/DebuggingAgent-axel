To resolve the issue described, I need to analyze the source code related to the `linkcheck` functionality. Specifically, I should inspect the logic for checking anchors when `linkcheck_anchors` is set to `True` and how HTTP errors are handled.

First, I will locate the relevant method or class dealing with anchor checking during link validation in the Sphinx codebase. Since the issue pertains to link checking, I should start by looking for code related to that functionality.

I'll search for the method or class responsible for handling the linkcheck operation to examine how errors are reported.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("linkcheck")
search_class_in_codebase("LinkCheck")
search_method_in_codebase("check_anchor")
```

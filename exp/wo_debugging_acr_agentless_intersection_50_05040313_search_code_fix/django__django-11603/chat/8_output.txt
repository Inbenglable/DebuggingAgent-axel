To determine if the issue is resolved, let's break down the key elements of the test results and the patch.

1. **Test Analysis**:
   - The provided test aims to reproduce the issue pertaining to the addition of `DISTINCT` support for `Avg`, `Sum`, `Min`, and `Max` aggregates by triggering an `Exception` since using `distinct=True` should raise an exception in the context of Django version 3.0.
   - Both `ORIGINAL OUTPUT` and `PATCHED OUTPUT` show the same error message:
     ```
     django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet.
     ```
   - This error indicates that the test setup is misconfigured and does not run to completion due to Django applications not being ready. The problem lies with the test configuration rather than the patch effect.

2. **Patch Analysis**:
   - The patch involved adding `allow_distinct = True` to the classes of `Avg`, `Sum`, `Min`, and `Max` in `django/db/models/aggregates.py`.
   - This change logically supports the intended feature of allowing `DISTINCT` operations in these aggregates.

Given these considerations:

- The error present in both outputs (`original` and `patched`) is not directly related to the fix because the application setup is faulty before reaching aggregate logic execution.
- However, based purely on patch content, the change reflects the logical requirement needed for enabling `DISTINCT` support for the mentioned aggregates.

Therefore, due to the failure in executing the test case due to setup issues, we cannot unequivocally confirm whether the patch resolves the issue based on available output. The error needs to be addressed before determining the effectiveness of the patch.

Issue resolved: `False`

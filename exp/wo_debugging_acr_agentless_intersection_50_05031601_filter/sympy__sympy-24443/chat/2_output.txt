To address the issue related to the `_check_homomorphism` method in the **sympy** project as hinted in the context, I first need to obtain the source code related to the `_image()` function. This function seems to be an internal logic within the `sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py` file, possibly a part of the `_check_homomorphism` method or directly related to the handling of `PermutationGroup`. Let's begin by locating and retrieving the needed code.

Given the context, hereâ€™s how I'll proceed:
- First, I'll obtain the source code for the `_check_homomorphism` method (if it exists in the same file) to inspect the related logic.
- If needed, I'll locate the `_image()` function directly.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py", "_check_homomorphism")
search_code_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py", "def _image")
```

To address the issue with the autodoc extension of Sphinx, we need to verify how autodoc processes the `__all__` attribute within a module. Considering the description, it seems autodoc is not respecting an empty `__all__` list, which should exclude all functions from documentation. It is likely handled by specific methods or logic within the autodoc extension source code.

I will need to explore the autodoc extension source code in order to understand how the `__all__` attribute is currently processed. This typically involves looking at the module starting point in the autodoc extension where it defines its functionality. Additionally, to troubleshoot the issue, I'll search for the relevant code handling `__all__`.

Let's proceed with searching for the relevant source code in Sphinx's autodoc extension that deals with the `__all__` attribute processing.

```python
search_code_in_codebase("__all__")
```

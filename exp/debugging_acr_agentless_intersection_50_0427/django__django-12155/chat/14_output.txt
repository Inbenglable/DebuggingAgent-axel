To resolve the issue with the `trim_docstring` function in `django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py`, we need to modify how the indentation level is calculated. Specifically, we'll skip the first line when determining indentation, as suggested in the issue description.

Here's the patch in the required format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())\n=======\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch ensures that the first line is not considered when calculating the minimum indentation, thus preventing the error reported by `docutils` when rendering view docstrings.

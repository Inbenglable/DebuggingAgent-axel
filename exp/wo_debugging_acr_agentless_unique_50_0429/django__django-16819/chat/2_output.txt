To address the issue of optimizing migration operations related to `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex`, I'd first need to review the methods associated with creating and deleting indexes in these classes. Since we have identified the classes `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex` in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`, I need to examine their methods specifically responsible for performing index operations on the database, which are `database_forwards` and `database_backwards`. 

These methods would handle the actual addition or removal of database indexes and examining them could provide insight into potential optimizations or unnecessary operations. I will retrieve the source code for these methods.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/operations/models.py", "AddIndex.database_forwards")
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/operations/models.py", "AddIndex.database_backwards")
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/operations/models.py", "RemoveIndex.database_forwards")
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/operations/models.py", "RemoveIndex.database_backwards")
```

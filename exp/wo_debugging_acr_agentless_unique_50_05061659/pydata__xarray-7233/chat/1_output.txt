To address the issue, I need to examine the implementation of the `coarsen` method in xarray and specifically look into how it handles the construction of new datasets. It's important to identify if there's a step where the coordinate status of data variables is lost unintentionally during the `construct` operation. 

Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code related to the `coarsen` method in the xarray project, and particularly how the `construct` operation is implemented in this context.

I'll start by searching for the `coarsen` method in the codebase to understand its implementation and where `construct` might alter the coordinate properties. 

```python
search_method_in_codebase("coarsen")
```

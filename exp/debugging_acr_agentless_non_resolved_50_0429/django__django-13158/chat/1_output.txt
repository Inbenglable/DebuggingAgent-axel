To trace the abnormal program behavior and identify the root cause of the bug, we need to look into how the `union()` method affects the behavior of the form when no selections are made. The test produces an error due to missing tables, indicating issues with database initialization. Moreover, we need to focus on understanding why the union of querysets results in the addition of unexpected objects when no choices are selected in the form.

Given the abnormal behavior described, our first step is to observe the methods related to the query operations and form handling. The main focus should be understanding how Django handles the union query in a form submission context, particularly concerning the many-to-many field handling when data is not provided.

Considering this, the next method to observe is `models.query.QuerySet.union`, which is responsible for combining querysets.

Observed method: `django/db/models/query.py:QuerySet.union`

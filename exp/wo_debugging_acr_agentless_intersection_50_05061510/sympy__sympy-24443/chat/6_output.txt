To determine which of the retrieved contents are relevant for resolving the issue, I need to focus on the context surrounding permutation groups and the `_image` and `_check_homomorphism` functions in particular. Given the issue pertains to symmetry and permutation groups, these aspects are typically handled in the `sympy/combinatorics` module rather than `sympy/polys/agca`, which appears to be more related to algebraic geometry and beyond the scope of permutation group homomorphisms.

Thus, contents related to `_image` functions found in `sympy/polys/agca/homomorphisms.py` are likely irrelevant for the specific problem at hand. They are more associated with modules and algebra rather than combinatorics which includes permutation groups.

Therefore, I determine there is no needed content based on the source files provided:

This indicates that none of the current results are relevant for fixing the permutation group homomorphism issue. I may need to conduct an additional search specifically targeting the combinatorics/homomorphisms context or inspect directly the sympy's combinatorics module source code within `_image` and `_check_homomorphism` for permutation groups.

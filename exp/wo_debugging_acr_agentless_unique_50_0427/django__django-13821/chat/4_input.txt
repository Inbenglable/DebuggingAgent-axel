## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Drop support for SQLite < 3.9.0
Description
	 
		(last modified by Tim Graham)
	 
Indexes on expressions (see #26167) and the SQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1 compile-time option are supported on â€‹SQLite 3.9.0+.
Ubuntu Xenial ships with SQLite 3.11.0 (which will still by supported by Django) and will EOL in April 2021. Debian Jessie ships with 3.8.7 and was EOL June 30, 2020.
SQLite 3.9.0 was released in October 2015. SQLite version support seems like a similar situation as GEOS libraries which we generally support about 5 years after released.

In the previous round, you called search APIs to retrieve relevant source code that would help identify the root cause of the issue and generate a patch. However, the code you retrieved appears in multiple locations (maybe some are irrelevant but have same key). So now your task is to determine which of the retrieved contents are indeed you need, and filter out the irrelevant ones.
This is your API invocation round output:
To address the issue of dropping support for SQLite versions lower than 3.9.0 in the Django project, we need to identify the parts of the codebase where the SQLite version is checked or enforced. This often involves examining the database-backend code where connection settings are managed. We may also need to update documentation or error messages related to the supported SQLite versions.

First, I need to gather the source code involved in checking the SQLite version or configuration settings in Django. To achieve this, I'll begin by searching for relevant methods or classes related to the SQLite backend:

```python
search_class_in_codebase("DatabaseWrapper")
search_method_in_codebase("check_sqlite_version")
search_code_in_codebase("sqlite_version")
```

These searches will help identify where the SQLite version is checked or enforced within the Django codebase, as well as any related configuration settings or version checks. With this, I'll be equipped to modify the code to drop support for SQLite versions lower than 3.9.0.

And this is the corresponding API returned result (each content is started with #### FILE_PATH:NAME):
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_code_in_codebase("sqlite_version")

Among the API returned contents, there may be some irrelevant ones or not. So now you need to analyze each returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.
Now, please first analyze the API returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.

Then you need to choose you needed ones with the following format:
```
FILE_PATH_1:NAME_1
FILE_PATH_2:NAME_2
...
```

Note:
1. The value of FILE_PATH:NAME, must consistent with the API returned content (but remove the prefix ####).
2. You may select one or more contents, or even all of them if they are indeed you need.

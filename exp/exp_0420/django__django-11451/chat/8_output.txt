To proceed with generating the patch for the `authenticate` method in the `ModelBackend` class, it's essential to get the exact source code of the method. This will help in making the modifications to avoid unnecessary database queries when `username` is `None`.

Since the full path of the method is not provided, I will first search for the method in the codebase. Once located, I will proceed with retrieving its source code.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("ModelBackend.authenticate")
```

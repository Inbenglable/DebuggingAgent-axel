To resolve the issue related to the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass not working for properties, I need to review the source code of the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass. This will help me understand the current implementation, particularly the usage of `inspect.isfunction`, and identify how the code can be adjusted to accommodate properties.

I will proceed to locate and retrieve the source code for the `InheritDocstrings` class in the **astropy** project. Once I have enough information about the implementation, I can generate a patch.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("InheritDocstrings")
```

The provided source code for the `resolve_lookup_value` method demonstrates that the method currently coerces both lists and tuples into tuples. To fix the issue where lists should not be coerced into tuples and instead keep their original type, I need to modify the code to maintain the original input type (list or tuple).

I have enough information to generate the patch since the issue is isolated within the `resolve_lookup_value` method, and the required functionality is clear.

Ready generation: `True`

Let's review each piece of code from the API results and identify the relevant ones for resolving the issue with LaTeX printing of `Subs`:

1. **sympy/printing/latex.py:LatexPrinter._print_Subs**
   - This method is responsible for LaTeX printing of `Subs`. The issue we are addressing is incorrect parenthesizing, which is directly related to how LaTeX is rendered. Therefore, this method is essential for resolving the issue.

2. **sympy/printing/str.py:StrPrinter._print_Subs**
   - This method handles string representations of `Subs`. While it is relevant to how `Subs` expressions are printed as strings, it is not directly related to the LaTeX printing error we are focused on. Therefore, it is not needed for this particular issue.

3. **sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py:PrettyPrinter._print_Subs**
   - This method is related to pretty (formatted) printing of `Subs`. Although it deals with formatting and presentation, the issue pertains specifically to LaTeX rendering. Thus, while interesting, it is not directly needed for this LaTeX-specific issue.

Based on the analysis, the relevant code snippet corresponding to the LaTeX printing error in question is:

```
sympy/printing/latex.py:LatexPrinter._print_Subs
```

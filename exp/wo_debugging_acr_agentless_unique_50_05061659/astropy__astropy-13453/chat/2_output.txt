Upon analyzing the provided snippets, based on the nature of the issue regarding the `write` method and its behavior concerning HTML formatting:

1. **Notable Patterns**: Filter the `write` methods potentially related to ASCII table handling, especially those within the context of HTML or generic CSV or formats where formatting matters.

2. **Irrelevant Entries**: Exclude snippets strictly related to testing, unused write methods, or specific classes (e.g., Cosmology, Config, etc.) unless they directly reference or integrate with HTML or ASCII table output.

Thus, the following snippets appear relevant to the context, particularly focusing on HTML output or ASCII functions:

```
astropy/io/ascii/html.py:HTML.write
astropy/io/ascii/ui.py:write
astropy/io/ascii/fastbasic.py:FastBasic.write
``` 

These entries either directly reference HTML writing or are part of the ASCII writing framework. They may help pinpoint why `formats` is not respected in HTML output specifically.

To determine if the issue has been resolved, let's review the information provided:

### Original Issue
The `hist()` function was not respecting the `range` parameter when `density=True`. The expected outcome was for the bins to start at 0 and end at 1 when the range is specified as `(0, 1)`.

### Original Output
Before applying the patch, the bins output were:
```
[0.08971082 0.22754485 0.36537888 0.50321291 0.64104694 0.77888097]
```
This did not meet the expectation since the first and last values were not 0 and 1, respectively.

### Patch Review
The patch modifies the `hist()` function by:
1. Including the `range` parameter in the `hist_kwargs` if `density=True` and `bin_range` is not `None`.
2. Using `histogram_bin_edges` to respect the `range` for density computations when creating the bins.
These changes ensure that the `range` parameter is properly used in density calculations and bin edge determinations.

### Patched Output
After applying the patch, the bins output were:
```
[0.         0.16666667 0.33333333 0.5        0.66666667 0.83333333 1.        ]
```
This output correctly starts with 0 and ends with 1, as expected.

### Conclusion
The patch successfully addresses the issue by ensuring the `range` is respected when `density=True`, and the test output after applying the patch matches the expected outcome.

**Issue resolved: `True`**

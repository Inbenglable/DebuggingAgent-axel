In order to generate the patch to fix the bug in `test_huge_range_log` related to `LogNorm.__call__()`, I need to retrieve the source code for `LogNorm.__call__` from `lib/matplotlib/colors.py`. 

This will help confirm the exact lines where transformations cause issues and identify potential places for the bug fix that would better handle extreme values.

Thus, I need to invoke the search for the specific method.

```python
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/colors.py", "LogNorm.__call__")
```

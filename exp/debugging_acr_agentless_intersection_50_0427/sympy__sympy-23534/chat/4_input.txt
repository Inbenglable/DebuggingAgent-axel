## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Using symbols to create functions doesn't work if there is an extra layer of parentheses
Sympy version == 1.10.1

Using `symbols` to create symbol-like objects like instances of `Function` as shown in the [documentation](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/core.html?highlight=symbols#symbols) creates objects of class `Symbol` instead of `Function` if there is an extra layer of parentheses.

The extra layer of parentheses are necessary to deconstruct the output as separate tuples.

Running the code:
```
q, u = smp.symbols(('q:2', 'u:2'), cls=smp.Function)
print(type(q[0]))
```
#### Expected result:
<class 'sympy.core.function.UndefinedFunction'>

#### Actual result: 
<class 'sympy.core.symbol.Symbol'>

</ISSUE>


A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
To address the provided issue, we need to trace how the `symbols` function is handled in SymPy, especially when it involves multiple layers of parentheses and the `cls` argument specifying a different class than `Symbol`.

### Analysis:
- **Problem Overview**: The issue arises when `symbols` are created as instances of a class specified by the `cls` parameter with extra layers of parentheses. Instead of creating instances as specified (i.e., `Function`), the symbols are instead defaulting to instances of the `Symbol` class.

- **Behavior of `smp.symbols(...)`**:
  - In the provided test, `symbols(('q:2', 'u:2'), cls=smp.Function)` is expected to yield instances of `Function` instead of `Symbol` for each element in tuples returned.
  - However, the trace indicates that it returns tuples of `Symbol` objects. This suggests the `cls=Function` parameter's effect gets bypassed or improperly applied when tuple unpacking is involved.

### SymPy Code Analysis Context:
- From the trace, we see inside the function (`sympy.core.symbol.symbols`) that when `names` is not a string, it tries to process each element by calling `symbols(name, **args)` recursively and appending to a `result` list.
- The transformation `return type(names)(result)` suggests an attempt to convert results into a type resembling input shape (like tuples).
- When handling names such as `'q:2'`, SymPy attempts to break them into individual names (`q0`, `q1`, etc.).

### Observed Behavior:
- Instead of using `cls=smp.Function` to convert the symbols into functions, the actual type reverting remains `Symbol`.

### Next Steps:
To delve further into why the `cls` argument isn't effective when additional parentheses are involved, the next logical step would be to inspect processing within `symbols` for creating simple objects (i.e., leaves of the tree). This will provide insight into exactly how type/class creation defaults to `Symbol`.

Let's observe the `symbols` method where it could potentially handle symbol creation for each name and involve the `cls` argument. 

Observed method: `sympy/core/symbol.py:symbols`
==================================================
Based on the issue description and the behavior observed in the `symbols` function from the SymPy library, it seems that the function does not handle the `cls` argument correctly when dealing with multiple layers of parentheses for tuple unpacking.

### Key Points of Observed Code:
- The function `symbols` recursively calls itself when `names` is not a string. This is seen on line 794 when `names` is a tuple or list.
- It appears to apply the `cls` argument only to the innermost symbols when creating them. When this final processing occurs, the original `cls=Function` argument becomes ineffective in the presence of wrapping tuples.

### Steps Taken:
- We observed that an outer tuple (extra parentheses) triggers the recursive calling of `symbols`.
- The intended class (`Function`) is not applied to the correct scope.

### Hypothesis:
- The problem is likely in the loop or recursion segment that handles various object types coming from tuples, not correctly enforcing the desired class with `cls`.
  
### Next Step:
To further inspect how the recursion applies classes during object creation, I'm interested in analyzing the segment where recursive calls happen, which is in line `793`. Let's explore this segment further to ensure the class argument propagates correctly.

#### Downstream Code Scope for Further Observation:
Observed scope: `sympy/core/symbol.py:792-796`
==================================================
Upon analyzing the `symbols` method, we can break down the observed behavior as follows:

The core issue arises in the handling of the `cls` argument within the `symbols` function. Although the recursive call is correctly generating the names (like `'q0'`, `'q1'`, `'u0'`, `'u1'`), it is defaulting to creating `Symbol` instances instead of instances of the specified `cls` (i.e., `Function`). Here are the key points to consider:

1. **Parameters Initialization**:
    - The `symbols` function accepts a `cls` parameter which defaults to `Symbol` if not specified. In the debugging trace, we observe that while the outer call retains `cls=Function`, the recursive call appears to revert to the default `cls=Symbol`. This indicates that the recursive call does not honor the parent call's `cls` parameter.

2. **Recursive Call**:
    - In line 794, the call `symbols(name, **args)` inside the loop on line 793 passes the `name` and updated `args` but defaults to `cls=Symbol`. This behavior suggests that `cls` is not part of `args` at this stage. Therefore, when it recurses, it does not inadvertently carry along the desired class.

3. **Tuple Handling**:
    - After completion of the recursion, the result is being wrapped back into a tuple representing the nesting structure supplied as input. However, this does not affect whether the elements are of type `Symbol` or `Function`.

Considering these points, it is evident that the issue lies with the propagation of the `cls` argument during recursive calls within the `symbols` function. To fix this, the `cls` argument must be explicitly passed with each recursive `symbols` call to ensure that all created objects obey the desired class type of `Function`.

Therefore, the buggy method is identified as follows:

Buggy method: `sympy/core/symbol.py:symbols`
==================================================


Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

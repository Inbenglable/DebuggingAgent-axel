After analyzing the API returned content, we have the following:

The request was for the `fit_predict` method within the `GaussianMixture` class. The following contents appear relevant:

1. **sklearn/mixture/base.py:BaseMixture.fit_predict**
   - This method specifically pertains to mixture models (like GaussianMixture). It addresses how the model is fitted multiple times (`n_init` times) and discusses returning labels, making it directly relevant to the issue of differing results when `n_init > 1`.

The other contents returned by the API invocation appear to be methods from other classes and not directly related to `GaussianMixture`. These include implementations of `fit_predict` for processes such as pipelines, outlier detection, and different clustering models. They do not seem to have a bearing on the issue at hand or the `GaussianMixture` class.

Thus, the relevant content is:

```
sklearn/mixture/base.py:BaseMixture.fit_predict
```

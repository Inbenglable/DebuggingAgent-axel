To resolve the issue where `fit_predict` and `predict` return different results when `n_init > 1` for the `GaussianMixture` class, we need to inspect the implementation of these methods within the `GaussianMixture` class. Specifically, we should look at how these methods are performing the initialization and assignment of components when `n_init` is specified.

I will start by searching for the `GaussianMixture` class and its `fit_predict` and `predict` methods to gather more information.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("GaussianMixture")
search_method_in_codebase("GaussianMixture.fit_predict")
search_method_in_codebase("GaussianMixture.predict")
```

## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Callable storage on FileField fails to deconstruct when it returns default_storage
Description
	
If the storage argument on a FileField is set to a callable that returns default_storage, it is omitted from the deconstructed form of the field, rather than being included as a reference to the callable as expected.
For example, given a model definition:
from django.core.files.storage import FileSystemStorage, default_storage
from django.db import models
import random
other_storage = FileSystemStorage(location='/media/other')
def get_storage():
	return random.choice([default_storage, other_storage])
class MyModel(models.Model):
	my_file = models.FileField(storage=get_storage)
repeatedly running makemigrations will randomly generate a migration that alternately includes or omits storage=myapp.models.get_storage on the FileField definition.
This case was overlooked in the fix for #31941 - the deconstruct method tests if self.storage is not default_storage to determine whether to add the storage kwarg, but at this point self.storage is the evaluated version, so it wrongly returns false for a callable that returns default_storage.

This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
The error message in the output indicates an issue with the Django settings configuration. The error specifically mentions:

```
django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: Requested setting INSTALLED_APPS, but settings are not configured. You must either define the environment variable DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE or call settings.configure() before accessing settings.
```

This error is typically seen when working with Django outside the context of a fully configured Django project. In the provided test script, the line that sets up a minimal Django environment is:
```python
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'test_settings')
django.setup()
```

For the `django.setup()` to work correctly, a `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` must refer to a valid settings module, which usually includes `INSTALLED_APPS`. From the error message, it seems that the `test_settings` module is not properly configured, or perhaps it does not exist or is not accessible in the current environment.

To proceed, we need to focus on the method responsible for causing the improper configuration exception. The traceback points to:
```
File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-16493/django/conf/__init__.py", line 64, in _setup
```

Let's analyze the `_setup` method in the `django/conf/__init__.py` file, which is responsible for raising the `ImproperlyConfigured` exception when the settings are not correctly set up.

Observed method: `django/conf/__init__.py:_setup`
==================================================
Based on the issue description and the trace analysis:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem arises when the storage parameter on a `FileField` is defined using a callable that returns either `default_storage` or another storage option. When `makemigrations` is run, the storage parameter is sometimes omitted from the migration, leading to inconsistent behavior.

2. **Runtime Error**: The specific error observed in the trace is an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception due to Django settings not being properly set up, pointing out that it's attempting to access the `STORAGES` setting.

3. **Abnormal Behavior**: The abnormal behavior indicates an issue with the storage configuration when `default_storage` is involved. The cause of this error trace may not be directly related to the callable issue but rather a misconfiguration in the test settings or environment setup.

4. **LazySettings and _setup Method**: The `_setup` method in `LazySettings` is responsible for loading and validating the configuration pointed to by `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`. The error is triggered because the settings module is missing or incorrect.

Given the above information, the immediate issue appears to be configuration-related rather than a direct bug in the application's code logic for storage deconstruction. The test setup lacks the necessary configuration, which needs to be corrected.

To continue resolving the original migration storage issue:
- We should focus on the `FileField` deconstruct method where it decides whether to include the `storage` parameter.
- We would want to look into how `FileField` deconstructs itself when a callable is used for storage.

Let's continue by observing the relevant scope in the `FileField` logic, or correct the configuration to enable continuation of this investigation to a more specific location later.

Observed scope: `django/db/models/fields/files.py:240-260`
==================================================
To resolve this issue, let's analyze the current situation:

### Analysis

1. **Problem Context**:
    - The reported issue is related to the `FileField` in Django models, where a callable that returns `default_storage` or another storage causes inconsistency during migration file generation.
    - The testing setup is currently failing due to configuration errors related to Django settings, specifically `INSTALLED_APPS` not being properly set.

2. **Runtime Error**:
    - The error traceback indicates a misconfiguration with `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`, preventing proper initialization of Django settings necessary to run the model's migration logic.

3. **Code Analysis**:
    - The `FileField.__init__` method, where we hold a reference to the callable (`self._storage_callable`) for further deconstruction, highlights the critical part of this bug.
    - The runtime issue is indirectly related because the test script does not have a proper Django environment, leading to the `ImproperlyConfigured` error rather than truly testing the `FileField` deconstruction logic.

4. **Next Focus**:
    - The focus should be on ensuring the `FileField` correctly serializes the callable (i.e., including `storage=myapp.models.get_storage`) during deconstruction even if the default storage is returned.
    - The current trace was not directly influential to this, as the configuration led to disruptions in the test execution, not reaching the potential logic flaw in serialization within `FileField`.

### Next Steps

Since the analysis highlights the initialization (`__init__`) of `FileField` and the deconstruction as potentially not handling callable references correctly, our next step should be observing closely how a `FileField` uses this callable during the `deconstruct` method.

Observed method: `django/db/models/fields/files.py:FileField.deconstruct`
==================================================
### Analysis

From the information provided:

1. **Problem Context**:
   - The primary issue revolves around the `deconstruct` method in the `FileField` class, where the code fails to correctly serialize the `storage` parameter when it's a callable returning `default_storage`.
   - This results in inconsistent migration behavior when `makemigrations` is executed multiple times.

2. **Runtime Errors**:
   - The configuration-related error regarding `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` has been highlighted as an initial blockage for proper test execution. It indicates missing or improper settings, especially concerning the storage backend configuration.

3. **Current Observations**:
   - The `deconstruct` method conditionally includes the `storage` parameter based on whether `self.storage` is not `default_storage` (line 298).
   - However, when `storage` is a callable that might return `default_storage`, this comparison fails to capture the callable's identity correctly, leading to an improper omission of the `storage` parameter in the serialized output.

I suspect the logical flaw is how `self.storage` is being directly compared to `default_storage`, which doesn't account for cases where it is returned by a callable.

### Next Steps

Based on this understanding, the focus should be on modifying the deconstruction logic to appropriately handle cases where `storage` is a callable that might return `default_storage`. To confirm this, further analysis of the logic around the callable and the evaluation of `self.storage` should be conducted.

Let’s inspect the initialization of `storage` in `FileField` to see how the evaluation of a callable is set up.

### Trace Forward

Let's go back and trace how `storage` is initialized in `FileField.__init__` before it is used in `deconstruct`. This might help us locate where the expectation mismatch is happening.

Observed scope: `django/db/models/fields/files.py:235-255`
==================================================


Now you choose FileField.deconstruct's code snippet 
   235	    def __init__(
   236	        self, verbose_name=None, name=None, upload_to="", storage=None, **kwargs
   237	    ):
   238	        self._primary_key_set_explicitly = "primary_key" in kwargs
   239	
   240	        self.storage = storage or default_storage
   241	        if callable(self.storage):
   242	            # Hold a reference to the callable for deconstruct().
   243	            self._storage_callable = self.storage
   244	            self.storage = self.storage()
   245	            if not isinstance(self.storage, Storage):
   246	                raise TypeError(
   247	                    "%s.storage must be a subclass/instance of %s.%s"
   248	                    % (
   249	                        self.__class__.__qualname__,
   250	                        Storage.__module__,
   251	                        Storage.__qualname__,
   252	                    )
   253	                )
   254	        self.upload_to = upload_to
   255	

for further observation, tracing the abnormal program behavior.

This is the runtime information of the code snippet you choose to observed in FileField.deconstruct:

To address the issue of using `subprocess.run` with `PGPASSWORD` in the PostgreSQL backend for Django, I need to identify the relevant method within the `django.db.backends.postgresql.client` to understand how subprocesses are currently being handled.

The previous search didn't yield relevant results, so I'll perform a more targeted search to locate the appropriate code responsible for invoking subprocesses in the PostgreSQL client backend.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("runshell")
search_code_in_codebase("django.db.backends.postgresql")
```

I need to retrieve the full implementation details of the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` class, specifically focusing on the `__init__` method, to generate the patch. Since the initial retrieval only provided a placeholder, I will attempt to retrieve additional information about this class, particularly the `__init__` method, to proceed with the modification.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/contrib/auth/forms.py", "ReadOnlyPasswordHashField")
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/auth/forms.py", "ReadOnlyPasswordHashField.__init__")
```

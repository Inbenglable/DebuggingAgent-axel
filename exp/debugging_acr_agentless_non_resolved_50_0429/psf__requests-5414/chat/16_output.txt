To resolve the issue, the `send` method in the `requests/adapters.py` file needs to be modified to catch the `LocationParseError` exception thrown by `urllib3` and raise a `InvalidURL` exception instead.

Here's the patch to implement the fixes:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### requests/adapters.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        except LocationValueError as e:\n=======\n        except (LocationValueError, LocationParseError) as e:\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### requests/adapters.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            raise InvalidURL(e, request=request)\n=======\n            raise InvalidURL(\"URL has an invalid label.\", request=request)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch modifies how exceptions are caught by including `LocationParseError` along with `LocationValueError`, and it raises the appropriate `InvalidURL` exception message to conform to the expected behavior detailed in the issue report.

To address the issue of the 1-element tuple being incorrectly rendered, I need to inspect the `unparse` method in the specified file to understand how it handles tuples and to implement the necessary adjustments for correct rendering. I will retrieve the code for the `unparse` method in the `sphinx/pycode/ast.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/pycode/ast.py", "unparse")
```

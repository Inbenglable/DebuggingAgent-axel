To resolve the issue, I need to locate and review the `only_relation_agnostic_fields` method from the `MigrationAutodetector` class in the Django codebase, as the error traceback indicates the KeyError occurs in that part of the code. I will search for the method in the specified file containing migration autodetector logic.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("MigrationAutodetector.only_relation_agnostic_fields")
```

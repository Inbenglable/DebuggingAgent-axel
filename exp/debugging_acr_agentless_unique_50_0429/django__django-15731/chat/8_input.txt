## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
inspect.signature() returns incorrect signature on manager methods.
Description
	 
		(last modified by Shiva Kumar)
	 
inspect.signature returns incorrect signature information when used on queryset methods
import inspect
from django.db import models
class Person(models.Model):
	name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
print(inspect.signature(Person.objects.bulk_create))
# actual: (*args, **kwargs)
# expected: (objs, batch_size=None, ignore_conflicts=False)
ipython and jupyter seem to internally use inspect.signature to show documentation when using the <obj>? command and they too show incorrect signature information:
 
The issue is due to the code at â€‹https://github.com/django/django/blob/fe2e1478464846638082219c933a4302e5cf3037/django/db/models/manager.py#L84
Although we are ensuring the decorated method has the right name and docstring on lines 87 and 88, complete metadata is not copied.
The fix is to use functools.wraps instead of manually assigning name and docstring. wraps will take care of all the metadata and inspect.signature will return the expected output.
If the bug is acknowledged please assign the ticket to me, I would like to raise a PR for this.

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
The error message indicates that the Django settings have not been properly configured before attempting to use models, leading to the `django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured` exception. The specific issue occurs when trying to create the `Person` model, and the Django settings have not been set up at this point.

Here's a breakdown of the code execution leading to the error:

1. The `setup_django()` function is defined, which is supposed to configure the Django settings including `INSTALLED_APPS` and `DATABASES`.

2. The `main()` function attempts to inspect the signature of `Person.objects.bulk_create`, but this relies on the `Person` model being instantiated successfully.

3. The error occurs because the settings have not been configured before the declaration of the `Person` model class, and the Django model system checks the app configuration during the creation of model classes.

4. The stack trace shows that the error emerges when it tries to access settings through `self.check_apps_ready()`, indicating that the Django apps configuration hasn't been completed.

To resolve this error within the test script, you need to ensure `setup_django()` is called before any Django model class is defined or instantiated. This way, Django settings will be configured properly before the model tries to access them.

Before locating the buggy method related to the original issue in the Django manager code, we need to fix the test script setup first.

Observed method: `reproduce.py:setup_django`
==================================================
Looking at the current information, the issue arises from the `setup_django` function not being called before the definition of the `Person` model class. This is important because the Django settings need to be initialized before any model is defined. The error message clearly shows that the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting has not been configured at the time of accessing the model during module loading.

To address this issue in the test setup:

1. Call `setup_django` before defining any models or importing any modules that depend on settings.

2. Ensure that `setup_django` initializes settings early in the script execution to prevent any `ImproperlyConfigured` exceptions.

Given that the runtime error relates directly to the order of operations in setting up Django settings and defining models, the program behavior needs to be adjusted in script ordering:

Let's investigate further into how `setup_django()` sets up the environment by observing its execution closer up to the point where it sets the environment variable and configures Django settings.

Observed scope: `reproduce.py:19-35`
==================================================
The observed code snippet from the `setup_django` function shows the configuration process for Django settings. However, it seems like the settings are not being configured in time because the call to `setup_django()` occurs after the `Person` model class is defined. This results in the `ImproperlyConfigured` exception when the Django settings are accessed.

To address this issue, the `setup_django()` function needs to be called before any models are defined. This ensures that the settings, including `INSTALLED_APPS` and the database configuration, are initialized properly.

### Observations:
- The `setup_django()` function is designed to configure the environment, including `INSTALLED_APPS` and other necessary settings.
- The error occurs because the `Person` model is defined before `setup_django()` is called.
  
### Resolution Plan:
1. Move the call to `setup_django()` before the definition of the `Person` model class in the script.
2. Ensure that any Django-related setup logic (models, connections, etc.) occurs only after the settings have been configured.

Since this is a setup-related issue in the test script rather than a problem with the original Django methods, I'll focus on the root cause of the issue in the test setup first. Let's correct the execution order in the script and once the setup error is fixed, proceed to trace the original problem in the Django manager's code.

Here's the revised approach for setup:
- Invoke `setup_django()` immediately after importing modules and before defining any model or calling Django-specific functions.

Now, moving forward, let's continue tracing to locate the buggy method in the Django manager's code for the original issue with `inspect.signature`.

Observed method: `django/db/models/manager.py:get_queryset`
==================================================
Given the context, the issue revolves around the use of `inspect.signature()` returning an incorrect signature for manager methods due to incomplete metadata copying. This happens in the `django/db/models/manager.py` file.

The previously suggested fix was to use `functools.wraps` instead of manually assigning the name and docstring, which would ensure all metadata, including the function signature, is copied. We need to continue tracing within this file to locate the exact point where manager methods like `bulk_create` are being wrapped or decorated.

Let's focus on the specific lines in the `django/db/models/manager.py` file where method wrapping or decoration occurs. Proceeding to the relevant scope will help us identify where to apply the use of `functools.wraps`.

I'll trace the scope where this wrapping might be implemented, likely where decorators or wrappers are applied to the manager methods. This should be around line 84 of the specified file in your initial mention.

Let's observe the code around these lines to pinpoint the transformation affecting method signatures:

```plaintext
Observed scope: django/db/models/manager.py:80-100
```
==================================================
Based on the analysis conducted so far, the relevant section of code where the issue arises is related to the method wrapping using decorators. Here, we observed the method `_get_queryset_methods` which creates manager methods dynamically. The signature not being displayed correctly is due to incomplete metadata assignment during the creation of these methods.

To ensure full metadata, including function signature is preserved, `functools.wraps` should be utilized, replacing the manual assignment of the `__name__` and `__doc__`. This fixes the issue with `inspect.signature` by preserving the wrapped function's attributes.

Let's proceed by focusing more closely on this logic, in particular the creation of `manager_method` and how it is handled to facilitate the needed improvements with `functools.wraps`.

Upon following through the `BaseManager._get_queryset_methods`, it's now clear to move towards an actionable fix. Here is the pinpointed location:

Buggy method: `django/db/models/manager.py:BaseManager._get_queryset_methods`

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

To resolve the issue, I need to understand how the `Requests` library's `Session` class handles its headers, particularly in the context of setting a header value to `None`. I must examine the implementation of the `Session` class and its handling of headers to make the necessary modifications.

First, I'll need to find and retrieve the code for the `Session` class. Here's how I'll proceed:

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Session")
```

The issue occurs because the variable `kern` is being used in the assignment `hit = kern in s`, but `kern` is only conditionally assigned a value inside an `if` block. If the condition `' ' in s` evaluates to false, `kern` will not be assigned a value before it is used. This will lead to the `UnboundLocalError` when `kern` is referenced before its assignment.

To resolve the issue, we need to ensure `kern` is either initialized before it is used or handle the condition where `' ' in s` can be false. Since I have obtained the `kernS` function's source code and identified the issue, I am ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

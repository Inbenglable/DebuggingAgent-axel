To resolve this issue, I need to examine the code of the `IsolationForest` class to expose the `warm_start` parameter and ensure that it functions similarly to other forests like `RandomForestClassifier`. This involves examining how `IsolationForest` is currently set up, confirming its inheritance from `BaseBagging`, and implementing changes to accept `warm_start` in the initializer method.

Since this involves modifying the class, I'll first need to retrieve the source code of the `IsolationForest` class.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("IsolationForest")
```

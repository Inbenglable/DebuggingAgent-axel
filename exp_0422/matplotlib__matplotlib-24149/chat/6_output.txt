The `_safe_first_finite` function tries to find the first finite value in an input iterable. When passed `[np.nan]`, it raises a `StopIteration`, as there are no finite values in the input. This leads to the exception observed when calling `ax.bar([np.nan], [np.nan])`.

In this context, the faulty behavior results from using `_safe_first_finite`, which does not handle the case when no finite values are found, leading to a `StopIteration` that isn't caught.

### Analysis:
1. The issue starts when `_safe_first_finite` is used to find the first finite value in the input `x0`, which is `[np.nan]`.
2. If no finite values are found, `next()` raises a `StopIteration`, which isn't caught, causing the exception and breaking execution.

### Conclusion:
The bug is likely within the `_safe_first_finite` function. We need to modify this function to handle cases where there are no finite values in the input without raising a `StopIteration`. 

Thus, we have identified the problematic method:

Buggy method: `lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py:_safe_first_finite`

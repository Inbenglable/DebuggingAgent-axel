To address the issue, I need to locate and modify the method responsible for running the PostgreSQL client command within the `django.db.backends.postgres` backend. Since the previous search did not yield the relevant method, I need to search the codebase for the method that handles the client command in the PostgreSQL backend.

I'll proceed with searching for the `client` method specifically within the Django PostgreSQL backend code.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("client")
```

I have identified the file `sympy/printing/pycode.py`, which contains the `PythonCodePrinter` class. Since the methods related to printing functions like `_print_sign`, `_print_Not`, etc., are already present in this file, I have sufficient context to generate the patch. 

I'm ready to add the methods `_print_Min` and `_print_Max` to handle the conversion of `Min` and `Max` sympy functions to Python's `min` and `max` functions.

Ready generation: `True`

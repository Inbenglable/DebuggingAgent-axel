To create a minimal debugging test, I'll focus on the nested compound model scenario that is exhibiting the issue. Since the problem seems to be related to the incorrect separability matrix for nested compound models, the test should specifically address this condition.

Here's the specific code in JSON format for the debugging test:

```json
{
  "debugging_test": "from astropy.modeling import models as m\nfrom astropy.modeling.separable import separability_matrix\n\n# Debugging Test: Nested compound model\nnested_cm = m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & (m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5))\nprint(separability_matrix(nested_cm))"
}
```

This test is designed to specifically reproduce the issue with the nested compound model configuration, allowing us to focus on the problematic case during the debugging process.

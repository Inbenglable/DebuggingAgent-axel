To ensure the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass also works for properties, we need to modify its `__init__` method to account for properties by checking `inspect.isdatadescriptor`. Here is the patch that handles this change:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### astropy/utils/misc.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            if (inspect.isfunction(val) and\n                is_public_member(key) and\n                val.__doc__ is None):\n=======\n            if ((inspect.isfunction(val) or inspect.isdatadescriptor(val)) and\n                is_public_member(key) and\n                val.__doc__ is None):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch adjusts the docstring inheritance logic to accommodate both functions and properties by utilizing `inspect.isdatadescriptor`, which is appropriate for properties and other data descriptors.

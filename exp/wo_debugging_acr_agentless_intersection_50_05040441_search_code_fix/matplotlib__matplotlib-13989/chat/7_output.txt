To determine whether the issue is fixed, let's analyze the provided information:

### Original Issue
The `hist()` function in `matplotlib` was not respecting the `range` parameter when `density=True`. The bins were not starting at 0 and ending at 1 as expected when `density=True`.

### Original Output
Before applying the patch, the output of the test was:
```
[0.10855861 0.28565337 0.46274813 0.63984289 0.81693765 0.99403241]
```
The output does not start at 0 and does not end at 1, indicating that the `range` parameter was not respected.

### Patch Explanation
The patch modifies the `Axes.hist` method to ensure that the `range` parameter is included in the histogram calculation even when `density=True`. This is achieved by altering the `hist_kwargs` dictionary to include `range=bin_range`.

### Patched Output
After applying the patch, the output of the test was:
```
[0.         0.16666667 0.33333333 0.5        0.66666667 0.83333333
 1.        ]
```
With this output, the bins now start at 0 and end at 1, which is the expected behavior and indicates that the `range` parameter is now respected when `density=True`.

### Conclusion
The patch seems to have successfully resolved the issue by ensuring the `range` parameter is applied when `density=True`. Given that the patched output matches the expected outcome as described in the issue, it is reasonable to conclude that the problem has been fixed.

Issue resolved: `True`

To address the issue, I need to locate the line causing the `RuntimeWarning` and understand its context. Since the issue provides a file path and line reference, I should retrieve the surrounding code in `sklearn/metrics/cluster/supervised.py`. Let's search for the specific line mentioned in the issue.

```python
search_code_in_file("sklearn/metrics/cluster/supervised.py", "return tk / np.sqrt(pk * qk) if tk != 0. else 0.")
```

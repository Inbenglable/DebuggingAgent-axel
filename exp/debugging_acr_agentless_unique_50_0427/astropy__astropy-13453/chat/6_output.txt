The current method being observed, `astropy/io/registry/interface.py:UnifiedReadWriteMethod.__get__`, is simply a getter method that retrieves the associated unified read/write method for a given instance. It doesn't perform any operations related to table formatting or writing, but it's tied to the registration of I/O operations in Astropy.

Given the description of the issue, the problem likely lies in the handling or processing of format parameters when writing tables to HTML using Astropy's table interface. The observed method is not directly related to the processing of formats in the context of writing tables.

To delve deeper into where the issue might actually reside, we should consider examining the sections of the code that handle the writing of tables to HTML and apply formatting. This would typically involve methods in the `write` function chain dealing with HTML-specific formats.

Let's observe deeper into the code that handles the HTML writing operation. We'll need to look at the scope where the `formats` dictionary gets processed for HTML output:

Observed scope: `astropy/io/ascii/ui.py:write_table-xxx`, where `xxx` should be the lines of code performing the HTML table writing. Please provide this scope for me.

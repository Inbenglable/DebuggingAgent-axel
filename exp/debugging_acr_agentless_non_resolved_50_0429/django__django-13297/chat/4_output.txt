The current issue arises from improper configuration of the Django environment before attempting to interact with Django models and settings. The provided script attempts to configure settings using `settings.configure()`, but it doesn't ensure that Django's app registry is correctly initialized before accessing the models. The error originates from the attempt to define the `Account` model, which triggers the `__new__` method of the model's metaclass before the app registry is ready.

I've reviewed the runtime information of `LazySettings._setup` which confirms the error occurs due to the absence of an environment variable `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` or because `settings.configure()` was not successfully recognized due to misconfiguration of the app registry.

Given the issue description and the traceback, the source of the problem seems to be related to how Django's settings are initialized in the script and the order in which apps are registered and initialized. Before accessing models, Django expects the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting to be correctly configured and for the app registry to be ready.

To further trace the abnormal behavior and pinpoint the root cause in the code, we need to observe the initial setup of Django settings and how the script attempts to interact with models. We'll focus on the early stages in the script where `settings.configure()` is called and is supposed to ensure the environment is correctly prepared.

Observed scope: `django/conf/__init__.py:55-68`

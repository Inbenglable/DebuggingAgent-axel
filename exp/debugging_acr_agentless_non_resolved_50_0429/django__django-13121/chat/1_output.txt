The issue arises when trying to annotate a Django queryset with a duration field added to a `datetime.timedelta`, specifically on SQLite and MySQL databases. The error traceback shows a `decimal.InvalidOperation` due to an unsupported type for the timedelta microseconds component being a string. This suggests there might be an incorrect assumption about the type of values involved in the computation or conversion.

The problematic part seems related to how duration expressions are handled, particularly in the `annotate` part, which involves combining `DurationField` with a `timedelta`.

From the traceback, the initial error appears during the execution of the `_fetch_all()` call in `django/db/models/query.py`. So, to identify the exact cause, we should observe the `QuerySet._fetch_all` method, as it handles query execution and retrieval of database results.

Observed method: `django/db/models/query.py:QuerySet._fetch_all`

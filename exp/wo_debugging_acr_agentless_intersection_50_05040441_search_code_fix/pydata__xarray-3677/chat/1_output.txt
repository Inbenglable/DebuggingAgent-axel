To resolve the issue, the first step is to locate and review the `Dataset.merge` method's source code, which is where the error originates. This will involve searching within the xarray codebase to find the relevant implementation. Since we already know there is an `AttributeError` due to the `DataArray` object lacking an `items` method, reviewing the `merge` method's implementation should provide insights into why this occurs and how to address it.

I'll use the `search_method_in_file` API to find the `merge` method in the `Dataset` class, which we presume to be defined in `xarray/core/dataset.py` based on the traceback provided.

```python
search_method_in_file("xarray/core/dataset.py", "Dataset.merge")
```

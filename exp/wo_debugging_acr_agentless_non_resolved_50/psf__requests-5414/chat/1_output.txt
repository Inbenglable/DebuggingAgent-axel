To address the issue, we need to examine the part of the code responsible for handling URLs and the specific part that should raise an `InvalidUrl` exception instead of allowing a `UnicodeError` to propagate. The issue description points to a specific line in `requests/models.py`, which suggests that might be our starting point. Let's retrieve the source code for the relevant method(s) around that area to identify where the `UnicodeError` occurs and ensure it is properly handled.

```python
search_method_in_file("requests/models.py", "prepare_url")
```

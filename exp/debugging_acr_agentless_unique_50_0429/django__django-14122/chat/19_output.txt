Upon reviewing the provided information, it appears that the patch did not successfully resolve the issue, for the following reasons:

1. **Patch Review**: 
   - The patch aims to prevent fields specified in `Meta.ordering` from being included in the `GROUP BY` clause by checking if `expr.get_group_by_cols()` is empty. If so, it skips adding those fields to the `GROUP BY` clause.
   - This logic seems sensible for the reported issue; if the implementation correctly identifies expressions that should be excluded, it should prevent inappropriate inclusions in `GROUP BY`.

2. **Test Output Analysis**:
   - **Original Test Output**: Indicates a `RuntimeError` related to the order in which `setup_test_environment()` and `teardown_test_environment()` are called. The error is unrelated to the bullet point issue but reflective of a test setup error.
   - **Patched Test Output**: Shows the exact same `RuntimeError`, which implies that the patch did not alter the outcome of the test execution.

3. **Underlying Issue**:
   - Given that both the original and patched test outputs are identical and show an error related to test setup (not `GROUP BY` logic itself), the actual issue regarding `Meta.ordering` fields in `GROUP BY` was not effectively tested by the provided test script.
   - There is no indication from the output that the original issue (i.e., `Meta.ordering` affecting `GROUP BY`) was addressed.

Based on the identical nature of the test output before and after the patch–both showing a `RuntimeError` unrelated to the original issue–it's clear that the actual problem wasn't resolved by this patch.

**Issue resolved: `False`**

To resolve the issue, I need to modify the `_check_list_display_item` method as described in the problem statement. However, before generating the patch, I need to retrieve its source code. To do this, I'll search for the `_check_list_display_item` method within the Django project's codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("_check_list_display_item")
```

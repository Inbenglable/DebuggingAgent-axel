To create a minimal debugging test, we aim to isolate the specific condition from the bug report that is causing the unexpected behavior. The focus will be on reproducing the nested compound model behavior. Here's a trimmed-down version:

```json
{
"debugging_test": "
from astropy.modeling import models as m
from astropy.modeling.separable import separability_matrix

# Test for nested compound model
cm_simple = m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)
cm_nested = m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm_simple

# Output the separability matrix for nested compound model
print(separability_matrix(cm_nested))
"
}
```

This code snippet explicitly constructs the nested compound model, directly addressing the condition in question. It simplifies the test case by including only the necessary components. Running this will help us closely monitor and identify the problem within the `separability_matrix` function's handling of nested compound models.

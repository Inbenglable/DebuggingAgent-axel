To address the issue with the `units.quantity_input` decorator, I need to obtain the source code of the `quantity_input` method to analyze how it processes return annotations. This will help me understand where the failure occurs.

I will proceed to search for the `quantity_input` method in the Astropy codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("quantity_input")
```

To resolve the issue, I need to inspect the full source code of the `__init__` method of the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass, located in the `astropy/utils/misc.py` file. This will allow me to understand the current logic and implement the changes needed to also inherit docstrings for properties. 

I will retrieve the source code using the API.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/utils/misc.py", "InheritDocstrings.__init__")
```

To determine if the issue is resolved, we need to go through the steps and analyze both the patch and the test output:

1. **Patch Review:**
   - Two conditions in `fu.py` were modified to add a check for `rv.exp.is_number`, ensuring comparison only performed when `rv.exp` is not complex.
   - This is a logical way to avoid the `TypeError` when complex numbers are involved in comparison operations.

2. **Test Output Analysis:**
   - **Original Output:** The test failed with a `NameError` because `I` was not imported from SymPy, leading to a secondary error indicating the presence of the initial issue.
   - **Patched Output:** The test output is identical to the original output, indicating the patch changes did not directly affect the outcome due to the missing import of `I`. We see the same `NameError` followed by a failure message about the original issue still being present.

Since the issue was not addressed within the provided test environment (due to the missing import of `I`), the patched code could not be properly executed to confirm the resolution of the original problem.

Thus, the presence of the original issue remains unchanged by the given patch, because the test execution cannot reach a state where the effects of the patch are observable.

Issue resolved: `False`

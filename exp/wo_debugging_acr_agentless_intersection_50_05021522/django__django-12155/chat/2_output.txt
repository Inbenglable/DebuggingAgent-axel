The source code for the `trim_docstring` function has been retrieved. The issue and proposed solution are clear: the current code that calculates the indentation includes the first line, which may cause problems if the first line starts with the docstring content. The suggested fix is to modify the code to exclude the first line when calculating the minimum indentation.

I have gathered enough code to proceed with generating the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

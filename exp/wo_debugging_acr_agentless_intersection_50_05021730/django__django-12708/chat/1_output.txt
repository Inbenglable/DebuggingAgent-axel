To address this issue, I need to retrieve the source code of the method `_delete_composed_index` located in the file `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`. This will help me analyze the current implementation and provide a patch. 

I'll proceed with the search API to obtain the code for this method.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "_delete_composed_index")
```

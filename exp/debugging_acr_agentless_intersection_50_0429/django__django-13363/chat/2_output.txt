To address the observed issue, we need to trace and understand why the `tzinfo` parameter passed to `TruncDate` is not being utilized as expected and how the code currently defaults to using the global timezone settings. The traceback provided points to a setup issue, which is unrelated to the deeper Django implementation that we're interested in.

The focus should instead be on the handling of the `tzinfo` parameter in `TruncDate` within the `datetime.py` file. We have identified the `Trunc.__init__()` constructor as a relevant method, but analyzing this method alone does not pinpoint the actual failure related to ignoring the `tzinfo` parameter. 

The pertinent area to examine is around line 295 of `datetime.py` where the incorrect assignment or handling of the timezone might be observed, as suggested in the issue description.

Therefore, I will continue my tracing by examining the code around this specific line to see how the `tzinfo` parameter is processed.

Observed scope: `django/db/models/functions/datetime.py:290-300`

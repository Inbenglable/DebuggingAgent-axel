To resolve the issue where Django fields from different models, derived from the same abstract model, incorrectly compare as equal, I will modify the `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods of the `Field` class to take their model into account. This will ensure that fields from distinct models are not seen as equal just because they share the same `creation_counter`.

Here are the changes necessary to address this:

1. Modify `Field.__eq__` to include the model in its comparison.
2. Adjust `Field.__hash__` to account for the model.
3. Update `Field.__lt__` to consider the model when comparing less than.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if isinstance(other, Field):\n            return self.creation_counter == other.creation_counter\n=======\n        if isinstance(other, Field):\n            return (self.creation_counter, self.model) == (other.creation_counter, other.model)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        return hash(self.creation_counter)\n=======\n        return hash((self.creation_counter, self.model))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if isinstance(other, Field):\n            return self.creation_counter < other.creation_counter\n=======\n        if isinstance(other, Field):\n            return (self.creation_counter, self.model) < (other.creation_counter, other.model)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

In these changes:
- We modify the `__eq__` method by comparing a tuple of `(self.creation_counter, self.model)` to the equivalent tuple for `other`. This ensures equality is only true if both the creation counter and models match.
- Similarly, we change the `__hash__` method to hash on the tuple `(self.creation_counter, self.model)`.
- The `__lt__` method is updated to perform tuple comparison which naturally accounts for the model as a secondary comparison criterion after `creation_counter`. 

These changes maintain the existing logic for ordering and equality while adding additional specificity to account for the model as part of the comparison, addressing the reported issue.

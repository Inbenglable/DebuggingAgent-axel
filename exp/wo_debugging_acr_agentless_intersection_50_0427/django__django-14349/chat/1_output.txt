In order to address the issue where `URLValidator` tests are failing due to the behavior change introduced by Python bpo-43882, we need to make changes to how the `URLValidator` handles characters like LF, CR, and tabs. To implement this fix, the first step is to inspect the current implementation of `URLValidator` in Django. Specifically, I need to obtain the source code of the `URLValidator` to understand where and how URL splitting and validation are being performed.

Before proceeding with generating a patch, I will search for `URLValidator` in the Django codebase to locate its source code. This will allow me to devise a precise fix for this issue.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("URLValidator")
```

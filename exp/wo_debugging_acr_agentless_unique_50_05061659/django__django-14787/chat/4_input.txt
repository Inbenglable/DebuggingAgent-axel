## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
method_decorator() should preserve wrapper assignments
Description
	
the function that is passed to the decorator is a partial object and does not have any of the attributes expected from a function i.e. __name__, __module__ etc...
consider the following case
def logger(func):
	@wraps(func)
	def inner(*args, **kwargs):
		try:
			result = func(*args, **kwargs)
		except Exception as e:
			result = str(e)
		finally:
			logger.debug(f"{func.__name__} called with args: {args} and kwargs: {kwargs} resulting: {result}")
	return inner
class Test:
	@method_decorator(logger)
	def hello_world(self):
		return "hello"
Test().test_method()
This results in the following exception
AttributeError: 'functools.partial' object has no attribute '__name__'

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
The issue you encountered is likely related to how the `method_decorator` from Django is wrapping functions, specifically `functools.partial` objects, without correctly preserving their attributes like `__name__` and `__module__`. To address this, I need to review the implementation of `method_decorator` in the Django codebase to see how it can be modified to preserve these attributes.

I will proceed to search for the `method_decorator` in the Django codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("method_decorator")
```

    # of the method that will be decorated.

    # meaningless.
    if not hasattr(decorator, '__iter__'):
        update_wrapper(_dec, decorator)
    # Change the name to aid debugging.

```


==================================================

Your Output:
The issue is that functools.partial objects do not have certain attributes like `__name__`, which are usually preserved using the `wraps` function from the `functools` module when creating decorators. The current implementation of `method_decorator` does not ensure that these attributes are preserved when the decorator is applied to a method that is a `partial` object.

In the current code of `method_decorator`, we can see that it uses a helper function `_multi_decorate` presumably to apply multiple decorators and possibly handling the partial objects incorrectly without ensuring the preservation of function attributes.

To address this, I need to look into the `_multi_decorate` function within the same file or check what adjustments need to be made to ensure that `wraps` operates correctly on partial objects.

I will proceed to search for `_multi_decorate` in the `django/utils/decorators.py` file to understand how method attributes can be preserved.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/utils/decorators.py", "_multi_decorate")
```

    def _wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # bound_method has the signature that 'decorator' expects i.e. no
        # 'self' argument, but it's a closure over self so it can call
        # 'func'. Also, wrap method.__get__() in a function because new
        # attributes can't be set on bound method objects, only on functions.
        bound_method = partial(method.__get__(self, type(self)))

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

To resolve the issue of adding DISTINCT support for Avg and Sum aggregates in the Django project, I need to gather more information about the classes or methods responsible for Avg, Sum, Min, and Max aggregates to verify how these aggregates are implemented and how DISTINCT can be incorporated. This means I need to retrieve the source code for these aggregates.

Therefore, I will start by searching for the corresponding classes or methods related to these aggregates in the Django codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Avg")
search_class_in_codebase("Sum")
search_class_in_codebase("Min")
search_class_in_codebase("Max")
```

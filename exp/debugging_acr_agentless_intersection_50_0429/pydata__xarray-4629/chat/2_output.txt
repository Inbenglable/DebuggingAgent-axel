Analyzing the runtime information, we've observed that the issue stems from how attributes are handled during the merging process in the `xarray` library. Specifically, `merge_core` function utilizes the `merge_attrs` function at line 616 to handle attributes, and the abnormal behavior seems to be linked to this part of the function.

The code block that we suspect contains the problematic behavior is involved in combining attributes from multiple datasets. The issue noted in the original problem mentions that changing the merged dataset's attributes affects one of the source datasets due to reference linking rather than copying. Given this, the root of the issue is likely in how attributes are merged when `combine_attrs='override'`.

Thus, the probable buggy method is within the scope where the `merge_attrs` function is called and processed with the datasets. To identify the exact line of code responsible for the referenced merge instead of copy behavior, we need to review `merge_attrs`.

Let's examine this scope to pinpoint the flawed logic:
```python
Observed scope: xarray/core/merge.py:616-623
```

I have identified that I need to modify the `_print_Function` method of the `MCodePrinter` class in `sympy/printing/mathematica.py` to properly handle the `Max` function. Before generating the patch, I should retrieve the full code for the `known_functions` setup to understand how to modify it for `Max`. However, the API results indicate repetitive code retrieval for `_print_Function`.

To properly handle `Max` function conversion into valid Mathematica code, I need to explore more about the dictionary `known_functions` if it wasn't fully captured.

```python
search_code_in_file("sympy/printing/mathematica.py", "known_functions =")
```

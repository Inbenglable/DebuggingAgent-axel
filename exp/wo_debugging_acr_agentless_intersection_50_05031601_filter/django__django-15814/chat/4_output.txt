To address the issue found at line 748 in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, I need to know the context of the method where the snippet `opts = cur_model._meta` is located, enabling me to correctly identify where and how to replace `opts = cur_model._meta` with `opts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta`. Since the specific method containing this snippet hasn't been identified yet, I need to look for the method within `django/db/models/sql/query.py`.

```python
search_code_in_file("django/db/models/sql/query.py", "def ")
```

Here's the patch for correcting the missing import issue that arises in the `TypeSerializer.serialize` method. The objective is to ensure that `models.Model` includes the necessary import statement in the generated migration files.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/migrations/serializer.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            (models.Model, \"models.Model\", []),\n=======\n            (models.Model, \"models.Model\", [\"from django.db import models\"]),\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch modifies the special case handling for `models.Model` within `TypeSerializer.serialize` to correctly include `"from django.db import models"` in its import list, thereby addressing the `NameError` resulting from the missing import statement in generated migration files.

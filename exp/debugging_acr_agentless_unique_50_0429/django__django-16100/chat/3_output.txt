Analyzing the provided information, the main issue is an improper configuration of Django settings. The exception `django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured` indicates that Django settings are not set up correctly. Specifically, the error message "Requested setting INSTALLED_APPS, but settings are not configured" points out that the environment variable `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` has not been defined, or the settings have not been configured before accessing models, resulting in issues when importing Django modules.

The root cause lies in the setup of the Django environment in the test script. The setup is performed in the following lines of the script:

```python
# Set up Django environment
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'myproject.settings')  # Adjust the settings module according to your project
import django
django.setup()
```

The error indicates that either the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is not correctly set to the appropriate settings for the Django project or the settings module does not exist.

To trace further within the Django configuration, the method where the exception is thrown involves accessing apps that rely on the `INSTALLED_APPS` listâ€”this functionality is encapsulated within the Django app registry.

Observed method: `django/apps/registry.py:check_apps_ready`

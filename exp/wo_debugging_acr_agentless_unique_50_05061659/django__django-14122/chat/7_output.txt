Based on the gathered information, I have a sufficient understanding of the `SQLCompiler.get_group_by` and `SQLCompiler.get_order_by` methods, which are key to addressing the issue with `Meta.ordering` fields being incorrectly included in the `GROUP BY` clause. 

The next step involves adjusting how `order_by` is processed in the `get_group_by` method to ensure `Meta.ordering` does not unconsciously affect `GROUP BY` clauses.

Ready generation: `True`

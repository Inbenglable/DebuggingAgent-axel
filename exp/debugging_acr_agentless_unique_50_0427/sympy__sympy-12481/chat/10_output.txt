To determine whether the issue is resolved, let's assess the provided information.

### Patch Review

The patch is intended to address the handling of non-disjoint cycles in the `Permutation` constructor by removing a `ValueError` that gets raised for such cycles. Instead, it attempts to apply cycles in sequence by appending elements from each cycle into a list, allowing non-disjoint cycles to be processed correctly.

However, the output of the patched code indicates an `IndentationError`:

```plaintext
File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/sympy__sympy-12481/sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py", line 900
    temp = []
    ^
IndentationError: expected an indented block
```

This error suggests that the patch introduces a syntax mistake with incorrect indentation, causing Python to misinterpret the structure of the code.

### Analysis of Test Output

- **Original Output:**
  - The test fails as expected due to a `ValueError` because the `Permutation` constructor cannot handle non-disjoint cycles.

- **Patched Output:**
  - The patched output does not reach the point of testing the logic change because it encounters an `IndentationError`.

### Conclusion

The patched version does not fix the issue since the introduced syntax error prevents the code from executing properly. Consequently, the behavior of the `Permutation` class when handling non-disjoint cycles remains unverified, and the original problem persists.

Issue resolved: `False`

Expose warm_start in Isolation forest
It seems to me that `sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest` supports incremental addition of new trees with the `warm_start` parameter of its parent class, `sklearn.ensemble.BaseBagging`.

Even though this parameter is not exposed in `__init__()` , it gets inherited from `BaseBagging` and one can use it by changing it to `True` after initialization. To make it work, you have to also increment `n_estimators` on every iteration. 

It took me a while to notice that it actually works, and I had to inspect the source code of both `IsolationForest` and `BaseBagging`. Also, it looks to me that the behavior is in-line with `sklearn.ensemble.BaseForest` that is behind e.g. `sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`.

To make it more easier to use, I'd suggest to:
* expose `warm_start` in `IsolationForest.__init__()`, default `False`;
* document it in the same way as it is documented for `RandomForestClassifier`, i.e. say:
```py
    warm_start : bool, optional (default=False)
        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit
        and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole
        new forest. See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.
```
* add a test to make sure it works properly;
* possibly also mention in the "IsolationForest example" documentation entry;

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve this issue, I need to examine the code of the `IsolationForest` class to expose the `warm_start` parameter and ensure that it functions similarly to other forests like `RandomForestClassifier`. This involves examining how `IsolationForest` is currently set up, confirming its inheritance from `BaseBagging`, and implementing changes to accept `warm_start` in the initializer method.

Since this involves modifying the class, I'll first need to retrieve the source code of the `IsolationForest` class.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("IsolationForest")

#### sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py:IsolationForest
```python
class IsolationForest(BaseBagging, OutlierMixin):
    """Isolation Forest Algorithm

    Return the anomaly score of each sample using the IsolationForest algorithm

    The IsolationForest 'isolates' observations by randomly selecting a feature
    and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum
    values of the selected feature.

    Since recursive partitioning can be represented by a tree structure, the
    number of splittings required to isolate a sample is equivalent to the path
    length from the root node to the terminating node.

    This path length, averaged over a forest of such random trees, is a
    measure of normality and our decision function.

    Random partitioning produces noticeably shorter paths for anomalies.
    Hence, when a forest of random trees collectively produce shorter path
    lengths for particular samples, they are highly likely to be anomalies.

    .. versionadded:: 0.18

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_estimators : int, optional (default=100)
        The number of base estimators in the ensemble.

    max_samples : int or float, optional (default="auto")
        The number of samples to draw from X to train each base estimator.
            - If int, then draw `max_samples` samples.
            - If float, then draw `max_samples * X.shape[0]` samples.
            - If "auto", then `max_samples=min(256, n_samples)`.

        If max_samples is larger than the number of samples provided,
        all samples will be used for all trees (no sampling).

    contamination : float in (0., 0.5), optional (default=0.1)
        The amount of contamination of the data set, i.e. the proportion
        of outliers in the data set. Used when fitting to define the threshold
        on the decision function. If 'auto', the decision function threshold is
        determined as in the original paper.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.20
           The default value of ``contamination`` will change from 0.1 in 0.20
           to ``'auto'`` in 0.22.

    max_features : int or float, optional (default=1.0)
        The number of features to draw from X to train each base estimator.

            - If int, then draw `max_features` features.
            - If float, then draw `max_features * X.shape[1]` features.

    bootstrap : boolean, optional (default=False)
        If True, individual trees are fit on random subsets of the training
        data sampled with replacement. If False, sampling without replacement
        is performed.

    n_jobs : int or None, optional (default=None)
        The number of jobs to run in parallel for both `fit` and `predict`.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    behaviour : str, default='old'
        Behaviour of the ``decision_function`` which can be either 'old' or
        'new'. Passing ``behaviour='new'`` makes the ``decision_function``
        change to match other anomaly detection algorithm API which will be
        the default behaviour in the future. As explained in details in the
        ``offset_`` attribute documentation, the ``decision_function`` becomes
        dependent on the contamination parameter, in such a way that 0 becomes
        its natural threshold to detect outliers.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20
           ``behaviour`` is added in 0.20 for back-compatibility purpose.

        .. deprecated:: 0.20
           ``behaviour='old'`` is deprecated in 0.20 and will not be possible
           in 0.22.

        .. deprecated:: 0.22
           ``behaviour`` parameter will be deprecated in 0.22 and removed in
           0.24.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default=None)
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`.

    verbose : int, optional (default=0)
        Controls the verbosity of the tree building process.


    Attributes
    ----------
    estimators_ : list of DecisionTreeClassifier
        The collection of fitted sub-estimators.

    estimators_samples_ : list of arrays
        The subset of drawn samples (i.e., the in-bag samples) for each base
        estimator.

    max_samples_ : integer
        The actual number of samples

    offset_ : float
        Offset used to define the decision function from the raw scores.
        We have the relation: ``decision_function = score_samples - offset_``.
        Assuming behaviour == 'new', ``offset_`` is defined as follows.
        When the contamination parameter is set to "auto", the offset is equal
        to -0.5 as the scores of inliers are close to 0 and the scores of
        outliers are close to -1. When a contamination parameter different
        than "auto" is provided, the offset is defined in such a way we obtain
        the expected number of outliers (samples with decision function < 0)
        in training.
        Assuming the behaviour parameter is set to 'old', we always have
        ``offset_ = -0.5``, making the decision function independent from the
        contamination parameter.

    Notes
    -----
    The implementation is based on an ensemble of ExtraTreeRegressor. The
    maximum depth of each tree is set to ``ceil(log_2(n))`` where
    :math:`n` is the number of samples used to build the tree
    (see (Liu et al., 2008) for more details).

==================================================

Your Output:
To address the issue of exposing the `warm_start` parameter in the `IsolationForest` class, I need to:

1. Modify the `IsolationForest` class to include `warm_start` in its `__init__()` method.
2. Update the documentation to describe the `warm_start` functionality similarly to its description in `RandomForestClassifier`.
3. Implement a test to validate the warm start behavior in `IsolationForest`.

Given the code for the `IsolationForest` class, the next step is to inspect its `__init__` method to correctly integrate and document the `warm_start` parameter. Thus, I will retrieve the `__init__` method from `sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py`.

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}

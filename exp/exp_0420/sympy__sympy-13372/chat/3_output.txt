To proceed with the patch generation, I'll first need to retrieve the full source code of the `evalf` and `evalf_mul` methods from the `sympy/core/evalf.py` file to understand the context and pinpoint the exact location of the bug. This will allow me to see how `reprec` and `imprec` are being handled within the function and make the appropriate adjustment to address the UnboundLocalError.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/core/evalf.py", "evalf")
search_method_in_file("sympy/core/evalf.py", "evalf_mul")
```

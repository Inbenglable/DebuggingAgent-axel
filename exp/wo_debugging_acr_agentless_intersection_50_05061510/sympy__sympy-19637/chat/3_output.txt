Based on the analysis of the `kernS` function from the `sympy/core/sympify.py` module, the issue arises from the reference to the variable `kern` before it has been assigned when `quoted` is `True`. To solve this, the `kern` initialization needs to occur before any reference, ensuring it is accessible regardless of the code branch. Here's how the patch should be implemented:

```pythony
### sympy/core/sympify.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
hit = False
=======
hit = False
kern = '_'
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

In this patch, `kern` is initialized with `'_'` before any reference, ensuring it is available throughout the function. This modification resolves the error without affecting the logic where `kern` is assigned a unique value when necessary.

Let's provide the patch in JSON format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/core/sympify.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nhit = False\n=======\nhit = False\nkern = '_'\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

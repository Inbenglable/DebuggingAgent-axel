## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Add DISTINCT support for Avg and Sum aggregates.
Description
	
As an extension of #28658, aggregates should be supported for other general aggregates such as Avg and Sum. Before 2.2, these aggregations just ignored the parameter, but now throw an exception.
This change would just involve setting these classes as allowing DISTINCT, and could also be applied to Min and Max (although pointless).

</ISSUE>


You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To address this issue, it is essential to comprehend how the `Avg` and `Sum` aggregate classes are structured in Django, particularly regarding their handling of the `DISTINCT` keyword. Therefore, I need to locate and examine these classes within the Django codebase to understand where modifications need to be made.

I'll start by searching for the `Avg` and `Sum` classes in the Django project codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Avg")
search_class_in_codebase("Sum")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_class_in_codebase("Avg")
RESULT:
#### django/db/models/aggregates.py:Avg
```python
class Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):
    function = 'AVG'
    name = 'Avg'
```


### API INVOKE: search_class_in_codebase("Sum")
RESULT:
#### django/db/models/aggregates.py:Sum
```python
class Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):
    function = 'SUM'
    name = 'Sum'
```


==================================================

Your Output:
To make modifications to support `DISTINCT` for `Avg` and `Sum` aggregates, I need to review their implementation within the file `django/db/models/aggregates.py`. Specifically, the implementation details of these classes should include how they handle parameters and the relevant changes to allow `DISTINCT`.

Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code of these classes to analyze if they already incorporate this functionality or if I need to implement it.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Avg")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Sum")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Avg")
RESULT:
#### django/db/models/aggregates.py:Avg
```python
class Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):
    function = 'AVG'
    name = 'Avg'
```


### API INVOKE: search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Sum")
RESULT:
#### django/db/models/aggregates.py:Sum
```python
class Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):
    function = 'SUM'
    name = 'Sum'
```


==================================================

Your Output:
To resolve the issue of adding `DISTINCT` support for `Avg` and `Sum` aggregates, I may need to check if there is existing handling or any methods related to parameters processing that need alteration to facilitate the handling of `DISTINCT`. 

Therefore, I'll search for any methods within the `Aggregate` class that may relate to parameter handling, as both `Avg` and `Sum` inherit from it.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Aggregate")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Aggregate")
RESULT:
#### django/db/models/aggregates.py:Aggregate
```python
class Aggregate(Func):
    template = '%(function)s(%(distinct)s%(expressions)s)'
    contains_aggregate = True
    name = None
    filter_template = '%s FILTER (WHERE %%(filter)s)'
    window_compatible = True
    allow_distinct = False

    def __init__(self, *expressions, distinct=False, filter=None, **extra):
        ...

    def get_source_fields(self):
        ...

    def get_source_expressions(self):
        ...

    def set_source_expressions(self, exprs):
        ...

    def resolve_expression(self, query=None, allow_joins=True, reuse=None, summarize=False, for_save=False):
        ...

    @property
    def default_alias(self):
        ...

    def get_group_by_cols(self, alias=None):
        ...

    def as_sql(self, compiler, connection, **extra_context):
        ...

    def _get_repr_options(self):
        ...
```


==================================================

Your Output:
To resolve the issue, modifications should be made within the `Aggregate` class, which has a parameter `allow_distinct` set to `False`. To enable `DISTINCT` support, we need to change this to `True` for the `Avg` and `Sum` classes. 

I need to confirm the presence of the `as_sql` method as part of the `Aggregate` class to understand its function and see how the changes can integrate. Let's retrieve the source code for this particular method.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Aggregate.as_sql")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Aggregate.as_sql")
RESULT:
#### django/db/models/aggregates.py:Aggregate.as_sql
```python
    def as_sql(self, compiler, connection, **extra_context):
        extra_context['distinct'] = 'DISTINCT ' if self.distinct else ''
        if self.filter:
            if connection.features.supports_aggregate_filter_clause:
                filter_sql, filter_params = self.filter.as_sql(compiler, connection)
                template = self.filter_template % extra_context.get('template', self.template)
                sql, params = super().as_sql(
                    compiler, connection, template=template, filter=filter_sql,
                    **extra_context
                )
                return sql, params + filter_params
            else:
                copy = self.copy()
                copy.filter = None
                source_expressions = copy.get_source_expressions()
                condition = When(self.filter, then=source_expressions[0])
                copy.set_source_expressions([Case(condition)] + source_expressions[1:])
                return super(Aggregate, copy).as_sql(compiler, connection, **extra_context)
        return super().as_sql(compiler, connection, **extra_context)

```


==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

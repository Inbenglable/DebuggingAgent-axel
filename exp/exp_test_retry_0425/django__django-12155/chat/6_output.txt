The patch provided modifies the `trim_docstring` function in `django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py` as per the suggested fix in the issue description. The change involves calculating the indentation starting from the second line of the docstring instead of the first line, thereby addressing the concern of an initial non-empty line causing a failure.

However, when examining the test outputs both before and after the patch was applied, they are identical. Both outputs show an `ImportError` for `simplify_exception` from `django.contrib.admindocs.views`. This indicates that the test does not successfully run to completion or reach the point where the patch could be evaluated due to the import error. The output does not reach the point of processing docstrings, unaffected by changes in the docstring logic.

The testing framework reports can't provide a valid indication of the patch's effectiveness given the `ImportError`. This suggests that the error lies elsewhere, unrelated to the docstring indentation and not influenced by the proposed changes to `trim_docstring`.

Issue resolved: `False`

In order to resolve this issue, I need to examine the code responsible for version comparison within the Sphinx project, specifically the `needs_extensions` check. I will start by searching for the relevant part of the code in the codebase, possibly related to version comparison.

Given the symptom described, there is likely a function that handles this version comparison as part of the extension verification. I need to find this function to understand its implementation.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("needs_extensions")
```

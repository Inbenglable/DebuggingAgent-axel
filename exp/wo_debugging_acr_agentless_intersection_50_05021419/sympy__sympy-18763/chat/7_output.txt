To address the issue with incorrect parenthesizing in the LaTeX printing of `Subs` in Sympy, we need to focus on how the LaTeX string for `Subs` is generated. The API results have returned several `_print_Subs` methods from different parts of the Sympy codebase. These methods handle different types of printing for the `Subs` class.

Let's analyze each result:

1. **sympy/printing/latex.py:LatexPrinter._print_Subs** - This method is clearly responsible for the LaTeX representation of the `Subs` class. It constructs the LaTeX string that includes the expression and its substitution values. This is directly relevant to the issue.

2. **sympy/printing/str.py:StrPrinter._print_Subs** - This method deals with string representation (`str`) of the `Subs` class. It is not related to LaTeX printing, so this is not directly relevant to the issue.

3. **sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py:PrettyPrinter._print_Subs** - This method handles pretty printing, which is a form of structured, aesthetically pleasing text representation. It does not handle LaTeX printing, so this is not relevant to our issue.

Based on this analysis, the content we need to focus on for resolving the LaTeX printing issue is:

```
sympy/printing/latex.py:LatexPrinter._print_Subs
```

To resolve this issue, I need to retrieve the source code of the `IsolationForest.__init__` method from the `sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py` file. This code will be necessary to understand how to introduce the `warm_start` parameter.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py", "IsolationForest.__init__")
```

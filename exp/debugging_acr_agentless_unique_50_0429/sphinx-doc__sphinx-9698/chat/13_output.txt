To address the issue and generate a patch, I need to examine the current implementation of the `PyFunction.add_target_and_index` method within the `sphinx/domains/python.py` file. This will allow me to understand how it formats index entries, especially for cases where properties or methods marked with `:property:` are incorrectly registered with parentheses.

Thus, I will proceed with retrieving the source code for the method.

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/domains/python.py", "PyFunction.add_target_and_index")
```

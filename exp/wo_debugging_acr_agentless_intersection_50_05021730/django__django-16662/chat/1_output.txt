To address the issue of import ordering in Django migration files, I need to inspect the code responsible for generating these migration files. Specifically, I want to locate the code that generates or handles the import statements within Django migration files.

Before generating a patch, I need to identify and examine the source code that manages migration file generation and how it handles imports. There might be a specific method or function that handles this, likely in a part of the Django codebase that deals with migrations.

I'll begin by looking for the migration generation logic to understand where and how imports are organized.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("write_migration_files")
search_code_in_codebase("import datetime")
search_code_in_codebase("from django.db import migrations")
```

These searches may lead me to the specific code section handling import statements in generated migration files. Once I understand the source code, I'll be ready to formulate a patch.

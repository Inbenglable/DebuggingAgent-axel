To address the issue, we need to examine the implementation of the `format` method specifically within the `django/utils/numberformat.py` file, as this is where small decimals are being formatted potentially in exponential notation. We are not concerned with the `format` method in `django/utils/dateformat.py` because it deals with date formatting, which is irrelevant to our issue related to number formatting.

Based on the API result analysis, I will choose the following necessary content:

```
django/utils/numberformat.py:format
```

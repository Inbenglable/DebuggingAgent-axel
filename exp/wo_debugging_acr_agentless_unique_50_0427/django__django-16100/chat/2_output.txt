To address the issue of adding transaction handling to `changelist_view`, I need to determine which of the returned search results are relevant:

1. **tests/admin_views/admin.py:CustomArticleAdmin.changelist_view**
   - This snippet shows a custom implementation of the `changelist_view` method, extending from another class. This is likely a test or customization and does not give the complete implementation of the method that directly modifies or interacts with the database states. Therefore, it is not relevant for adding transaction handling to the main changelist functionality.

2. **django/contrib/admin/options.py:ModelAdmin.changelist_view**
   - This is the main implementation of the `changelist_view` method in the Django admin, which handles the "change list" view for models. This is the core functionality where data changes in the database could occur and, thus, is the relevant location where transaction handling should be implemented.

Considering the above analysis, the relevant content required for adding transaction handling is:

```
django/contrib/admin/options.py:ModelAdmin.changelist_view
```

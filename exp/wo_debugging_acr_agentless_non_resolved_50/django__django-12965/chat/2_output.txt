To analyze and potentially modify how the `delete()` SQL query is generated for `Model.objects.all().delete()`, it would be beneficial to first examine the `Collector` class and its `delete` method, which is referred to in the `QuerySet.delete()` method. This is likely where the actual SQL generation logic resides that has led to changes in the SQL query structure.

I'll proceed to retrieve the code for the `Collector` class and its `delete` method.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Collector")
search_method_in_codebase("Collector.delete")
```

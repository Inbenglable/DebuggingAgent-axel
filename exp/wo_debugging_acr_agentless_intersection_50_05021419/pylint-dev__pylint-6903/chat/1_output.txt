To implement a patch for the issue described, I need to review the implementation of the `_query_cpu` function in the `pylint/lint/run.py` file, as this is where the calculation that sometimes results in zero occurs. 

I'll retrieve the source code for the `_query_cpu` method to understand its current implementation and to figure out how best to handle cases where the calculated number of CPUs is zero.

```python
search_method_in_file("pylint/lint/run.py", "_query_cpu")
```

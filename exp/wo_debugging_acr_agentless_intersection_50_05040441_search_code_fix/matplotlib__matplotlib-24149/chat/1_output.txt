To address the reported issue with the `ax.bar` function in the matplotlib library when handling all-NaN data points, I need to examine the implementation of the `bar` method within the `Axes` class, which was referenced in the traceback. The `_convert_dx` and `_safe_first_finite` methods might also be useful to understand their roles in this scenario, as they are mentioned in the traceback and appear to be directly involved in the error.

Therefore, I will follow these steps:
1. Retrieve the `Axes.bar` method to understand how NaN values are handled.
2. Retrieve the `Axes._convert_dx` method to understand why it may be causing issues with NaN input.
3. Retrieve the `_safe_first_finite` method from the `cbook` module to understand how it interacts with NaN data.

Through retrieving the source code, I can better diagnose the fault and consider how it may be patched. Let's proceed with retrieving these methods:

```python
search_method_in_codebase("Axes.bar")
search_method_in_codebase("Axes._convert_dx")
search_method_in_codebase("_safe_first_finite")
```

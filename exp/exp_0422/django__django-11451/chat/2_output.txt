The issue mentioned seems to be a bug related to the `ModelBackend.authenticate` method in Django. The problem arises when either the `username` or `password` is `None`, leading to unnecessary database queries and password hasher operations.

From the output you provided, there is also an error in the testing script: `TypeError: run() missing 1 required positional argument: 'self'`. This indicates a misuse of the `run` method from the `TestCase` class in the script, which is unrelated to the original issue you're aiming to resolve.

Based on the initial description and your commentary, the adjustment you suggest is to return early from the `authenticate` function if `username` is `None` or `password` is `None`, thus avoiding unnecessary processing.

Due to the nature of the issue and the apparent location mentioned in the description, the method to examine and update does not appear in the call stack or the debugging output you provided.

Letâ€™s identify the potential method concerning this behavior in Django:

Buggy method: `django/contrib/auth/backends.py:ModelBackend.authenticate`

The error in the output indicates a problem when trying to import the `Window` function from the `django.db.models.functions` module. This suggests that the import statement in the test script is incorrect because `Window` is not located in `django.db.models.functions`, which is causing the `ImportError`.

In Django, the `Window` function is part of the `django.db.models` module rather than `django.db.models.functions`. The import line for `Window` should be corrected.

Let's trace this issue step by step to confirm this understanding:

The import statement in the test script is:
```python
from django.db.models.functions import Coalesce, Window
```

The error message is:
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'Window' from 'django.db.models.functions'
```

This error indicates the program's behavior is indeed due to the incorrect location from which `Window` is being imported. Here, `Window` should actually be imported as follows:
```python
from django.db.models import Window
```

Given this analysis, I can already locate the buggy method:

Buggy method: `reproduce.py:<module>`

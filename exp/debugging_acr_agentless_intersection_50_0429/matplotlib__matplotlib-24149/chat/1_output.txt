Analyzing the traceback and the execution error, the issue arises when executing `ax.bar([np.nan], [np.nan])`, which calls `Axes.bar` in the `_axes.py` file. Within this method, it attempts to use `self._convert_dx(width, x0, x, self.convert_xunits)`. This line then invokes the `_convert_dx` method, which calls `cbook._safe_first_finite(x0)`. 

The `StopIteration` exception originates from the `_safe_first_finite` function in `matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py`, which is attempting to find the first finite value from an iterable that only contains `np.nan`.

The error suggests that there is no check or handling for iterables consisting solely of `np.nan` values, causing `next` to run into a `StopIteration` when it can't find a finite number.

To trace the function that's directly causing the observed abnormal behavior, we should take a look at the `_safe_first_finite` function, as it appears to be handling the input incorrectly in the context of this bug.

Observed method: `lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py:_safe_first_finite`

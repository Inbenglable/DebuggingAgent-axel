The issue is with the Django application setup in the provided test script. 

The error `django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: Requested setting INSTALLED_APPS, but settings are not configured...` indicates that Django settings are not fully initialized before accessing them.

In the script, settings are attempted to be configured inline, but it seems the initialization order is causing the `INSTALLED_APPS` to not be properly set before request processing starts. This is reflected by the error encountered in the model definition:

```
File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-13297/django/db/models/base.py", line 108, in __new__
app_config = apps.get_containing_app_config(module)
```

This file path `/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-13297/reproduce.py` corresponds to the script where the issue occurs. Within this script, upon trying to create the `Account` model class, Django attempts to access settings leading to the error.

To resolve this, ensure that the Django settings configuration is fully completed and any required Django app infrastructure (like models or migrations) should be initialized only after settings are properly configured.

Before performing a fix or configuring settings, let's narrow it down to the exact initialization method that's failing here. Since the issue is thrown during model initialization, let's start tracing from there.

Observed method: `django.db.models.base:ModelBase.__new__`

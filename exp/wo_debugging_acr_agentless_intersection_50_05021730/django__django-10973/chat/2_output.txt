To resolve the issue, I need to locate the file where the client method for the PostgreSQL backend is implemented in Django. Since the initial search didn't yield a direct result for the PostgreSQL client method, I'll perform a broader search to try identifying the correct method within Django's codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("PostgreSQLClient")
search_method_in_codebase("run_psql")
```

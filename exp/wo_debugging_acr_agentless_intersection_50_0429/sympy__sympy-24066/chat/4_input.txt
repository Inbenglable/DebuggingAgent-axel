Now You need to reolve the following issue in the **sympy** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
SI._collect_factor_and_dimension() cannot properly detect that exponent is dimensionless
How to reproduce:

```python
from sympy import exp
from sympy.physics import units
from sympy.physics.units.systems.si import SI

expr = units.second / (units.ohm * units.farad)
dim = SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(expr)[1]

assert SI.get_dimension_system().is_dimensionless(dim)

buggy_expr = 100 + exp(expr)
SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(buggy_expr)

# results in ValueError: Dimension of "exp(second/(farad*ohm))" is Dimension(time/(capacitance*impedance)), but it should be Dimension(1)
```

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue, we need to review the source code of the `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension()` method. This method is in charge of returning the dimension, and it seems not correctly identifying the dimensionless aspect of certain expressions. I need to retrieve this method's source code first.

Additionally, since the issue mentions the dimension handling of expressions involving `exp`, reviewing how dimensions are handled in general in the `SI` class might be necessary. Therefore, I will first search for the method `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension()` and check its implementation.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("SI._collect_factor_and_dimension")

==================================================

Your Output:
The source code for the `UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension()` method has been retrieved. The issue arises when the code processes exponentials where the exponent is dimensionless, but this is not properly handled, resulting in incorrect dimension calculations.

After reviewing the existing code, an adjustment needs to be made in the `Function` handling part of the method. We need to ensure that when functions like `exp()` are processed, the argument passed to them is checked explicitly for dimensionlessness and recalculated accordingly to have a dimension of 1.

Here is the plan to resolve the issue:
- Modify the part of the implementation dealing with `expr` being of type `Function`.
- Check each argument of the function to ensure if its dimension is dimensionless and enforce dimension 1 where applicable.

I am ready to make these adjustments, so no further source code retrieval is necessary.

Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

After reviewing the patch, it is evident that the intention was to improve the version comparison by using the `packaging.version` module, which can correctly interpret version strings semantically rather than lexicographically.

However, the patched output is identical to the original output. The AssertionError is still raised, indicating that the string comparison still occurs incorrectly, and the extension version 0.10.0 is not recognized as greater than the required version 0.6.0. This means that the problem with string-based comparison persists, and the patch did not rectify the issue in the test environment.

Therefore, the issue has not been resolved. 

Issue resolved: `False`

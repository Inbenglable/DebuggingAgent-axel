To review the patch and evaluate whether the issue is fixed or not, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Understanding the Issue**:
   - The issue occurs due to a `ValueError: 'id' is not in list` when using `QuerySet.only()` after `select_related()` on proxy models.

2. **Patch Context**:
   - The patch updates two lines in the `django/db/models/query.py` file.
   - It involves changes in how field names (`attname`) are gathered using the `concrete_model` of `klass_info["model"]` and `model_cls` instead of directly accessing the `_meta` attributes.

3. **Original and Patched Output**:
   - In both original and patched outputs, the test script fails with a `ModuleNotFoundError` related to `'your_project'`, which indicates that the Django project settings are not configured.
   - This error is unrelated to the issue with proxy models and is due to the environment setup in the testing script.

4. **Implication of the Patch**:
   - The patch appropriately addresses the need to access the `concrete_model` when resolving fields and primary keys in proxy models, aligning with the explanation given for the issue and proposed manual solution (`opts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta`).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Although the testing script's failure is due to configuration issues and does not directly verify the fix, the logical changes in the patch are aimed at addressing the described problem with proxy models.

Based on this analysis, the patch aligns well with the intended fix for the bug as described. However, the test cannot confirm this because it fails for unrelated reasons (project configuration error).

**Issue resolved: `True`**

Note: The testing setup needs correction for proper verification, but the patch itself logically addresses the problem stated in the issue.

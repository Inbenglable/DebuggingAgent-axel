To address the issue effectively, I should retrieve the exact implementation of the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` in the `django/contrib/auth/forms.py` file. Once I have the source code, I can proceed to implement the default `disabled=True` feature for this field.

Let's retrieve the source code for `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField`:

```python
search_class_in_file("django/contrib/auth/forms.py", "ReadOnlyPasswordHashField")
```

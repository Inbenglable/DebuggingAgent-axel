To address the issue of merging a `DataArray` into a `Dataset` using the `ds.merge()` method, let's analyze the stack trace and the call sequence leading to the error.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the observed behavior:

1. **The Operation:**
   - The example Python script involves calling `ds.merge(da)` where `ds` is a `Dataset` and `da` is a `DataArray`.
   - The `xr.merge([ds, da])` works as expected, but `ds.merge(da)` causes an error.

2. **The Error:**
   - The error traceback identifies that an `AttributeError` is raised with the message `'DataArray' object has no attribute 'items'`.
   - The error occurs in the `xarray/core/merge.py` file, specifically within the `coerce_pandas_values` function.

3. **Key Points in Trace:**
   - The `ds.merge()` method is invoked, leading to the `dataset_merge_method` function.
   - The `merge_core` method is then used, which calls `coerce_pandas_values`.
   - Within `coerce_pandas_values`, there is an attempt to iterate over `obj.items()`, assuming `obj` is a dictionary-like object, but it fails because `obj` is a `DataArray`.

This indicates that the `ds.merge()` method inappropriately attempts to handle the `DataArray` directly as if it were a dictionary-like object, which is not the correct way to treat a `DataArray`.

Given this analysis, it is evident that the problem lies in handling how `DataArray` objects are processed when mixed with `Dataset` objects during the `merge` operation.

Thus, I have identified that the potential issue may arise from how objects are processed in the `dataset_merge_method`.

I will trace the `dataset_merge_method` more closely to pinpoint how it can correctly handle a `DataArray`.

Observed method: `xarray/core/merge.py:dataset_merge_method`

### Analysis of Current Observed Code and Abnormal Program Behavior

From the initial analysis and the observed test case, the following actions have been identified:

1. **Test Case Operations**: The input test case carries out three `AlterField` operations on the same field of the model, sequentially refining the field definition.

2. **Optimization Issue**: The optimizer is expected to reduce multiple `AlterField` operations on the same field to the last relevant state of the field. However, it currently does not reduce all intermediate `AlterField` operations as expected when the initial `AddField` is missing.

3. **Current Program Behavior**:
   - **Expected**: The optimizer should reduce all intermediate `AlterField` operations into a single `AlterField` reflecting the final state.
   - **Observed**: The optimizer reduces the first alteration and skips further reductions, retaining multiple operations instead of compacting them into a single operation.

### Observing the Current Implementation

The given code already directs attention to the critical parts where behavior is potentially deviating from the expected results. The `MigrationOptimizer.optimize` method is responsible for iterating and calling the `optimize_inner` method. The problem is more likely located in either `AlterField.reduce` or how `optimize_inner` processes these reduce operations.

### Conclusion Before Debugging Step

Given the observations, the most relevant piece of code to inspect next is the `AlterField.reduce` method. This is critical since this method should determine when successive `AlterField` operations apply reductions.

### Next Step

We'll analyze the behavior inside the `AlterField.reduce` method within the `AlterField` class, which appears to be the core logic determining reductions of operations.

### Selected Method for Further Observation

**Observed Method:**
`ALTER_FIELD_METHOD: /django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py:AlterField.reduce`

Let's delve into the reduction method to gain better insight into its execution and determine where the issue lies exactly.

```python
Observed method: django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py:AlterField.reduce
```

To determine whether the issue is fixed, let's go through the provided information step by step.

### Issue Description:
- The main problem is that `call_command` fails with a `CommandError` when a required argument of a mutually exclusive group is passed as a keyword argument (`kwargs`).
- Specifically, the command should recognize and correctly handle arguments that are part of a mutually exclusive group when they are passed via `kwargs`.

### Test Scenario:
Before applying the patch, calling `call_command('command', shop_id=1)` results in:
- `django.core.management.base.CommandError: Unknown command: 'command'`
This indicates that the command is not recognized, likely due to an issue with how arguments are parsed or added.

### Patch Description:
- The patch modifies the parsing logic to correctly consider mutually exclusive groups.
- It ensures that arguments within satisfied mutually exclusive groups are considered collectively required, addressing the issue of recognizing them when passed as keyword arguments.

### Test Output:
- **Original Output** and **Patched Output** are identical, indicating that both result in the same error: `CommandError: Unknown command: 'command'`.
- Both the test before and after applying the patch fail to run the specified command due to a `KeyError` arising from the command not being found in the list of available commands.

### Conclusion:
Despite the applied patch, the command still fails due to the same reason, which is not directly related to the handling of mutually exclusive groups, but rather an issue with recognizing the command itself.

Therefore, the underlying problem described in the issue has not been resolved by the patch.

Issue resolved: `False`

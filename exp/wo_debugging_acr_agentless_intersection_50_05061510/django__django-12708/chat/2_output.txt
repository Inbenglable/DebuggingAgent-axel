To address the issue, I need to gather additional context around how constraints are named and managed. This will help ensure that the fix satisfies both cases: when index_together and unique_together are declared on the same fields, and the migration logic for index deletion. 

I will retrieve the code for `_delete_constraint_sql`, since this is directly invoked within `_delete_composed_index`, as well as the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor._constraint_names` method, which generates the constraint names.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "_delete_constraint_sql")
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor._constraint_names")
```

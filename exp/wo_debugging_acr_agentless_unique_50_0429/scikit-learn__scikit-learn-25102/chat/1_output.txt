To address the issue of preserving dtypes in the transformed DataFrame, we need to examine how the `set_output` functionality and related methods work in the scikit-learn codebase, particularly focusing on `_SetOutputMixin`, `_wrap_in_pandas_container`, and related data handling methods. Since the problem involves altering a potential dtype handling mechanism within the transformation process, the starting point is to search for these methods/classes.

Let's proceed with retrieving the source code for the relevant parts:

```python
search_class_in_codebase("_SetOutputMixin")
search_method_in_codebase("_wrap_in_pandas_container")
```

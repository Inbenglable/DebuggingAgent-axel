Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))

project = 'Test'
copyright = '2023'
author = 'Test'

extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc']


This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
Based on the issue description, it seems that the problem lies in how the `autodoc` processes the `__all__` attribute in a module. Specifically, the `autodoc` plugin should respect the `__all__` attribute when generating documentation, excluding members not listed in `__all__`, even if `__all__` is empty.

The reproduction test suggests that the source code does not respect an empty `__all__` attribute when generating documentation, as functions `foo`, `bar`, and `baz` are shown in the documentation despite `__all__` being empty.

Here is how we might trace the abnormal program behavior:

1. **Current behavior**: All module-level functions are documented by `autodoc`, despite the module's `__all__` being empty.
2. **Expected behavior**: If `__all__` is empty, no module-level functions should be documented.

The buggy method is likely responsible for gathering and filtering members of a module based on the `__all__` attribute within the `autodoc` extension. The next step involves identifying the part of the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` extension that processes the `__all__` attribute.

Proceeding with tracing, the next step involves finding the method responsible for determining which members of a module are documented. This is likely within the `autodoc` extension implementation.

Therefore, the next method to observe would be the one within the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` extension responsible for handling the logic related to member selection based on the `__all__` attribute.

Observed method: `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:Documenter.get_module_members`
==================================================
Analyzing the code in the `ModuleDocumenter.get_module_members` method, this function's task is to gather the members of a module by iterating over its attributes and collecting them into a dictionary. This dictionary, `members`, holds names of module-level functions.

Here's a breakdown of the method:

- The method iterates over the object's attributes using `dir(self.object)` (line 1054).
- For each attribute name, it attempts to retrieve the value using `safe_getattr` and then stores it along with its documentation in a dictionary `members` (lines 1055-1058).
- There is a second iteration that collects annotation-only members via `inspect.getannotations`. These members are added to `members` (lines 1064-1068).

Current behavior: This method gathers all members of the module, irrespective of the `__all__` attribute's content. The observed module-level members are collected as long as they exist.

The expected behavior: Ideally, the method should check if `__all__` is defined and, if it is empty, exclude the members from documentation generation.

The specific logic that needs adjustment involves filtering based on `__all__`. Therefore, the next task is verifying how `__all__` is handled, as it must be respected to guide member inclusion/exclusion.

Since there's no explicit handling of `__all__` visible here, the issue likely resides in either this method or the context that invokes it or processes its results. However, to confirm the responsibilities, tracing further into the handling process or the invocation context is necessary.

The scope of interest that might be missing `__all__` logic or is influencing its processing is lines 1054-1072, where members are gathered without regard to `__all__`.

Observed scope: `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:1054-1072`
==================================================
The observed code in the `ModuleDocumenter.get_module_members` method shows that it gathers the members of a module by iterating over its attributes using `dir(self.object)` and stores them into a dictionary `members`. There is no explicit check or handling of the `__all__` attribute in this snippet. Hereâ€™s a closer look at the steps:

- The method attempts to retrieve each attribute value and associated documentation from `attr_docs`, then stores it in the `members` dictionary (lines 1054-1058).
- Annotation-only members are similarly collected and added to `members` (lines 1063-1068).

The key issue here is the lack of any filtering based on the `__all__` attribute. For Sphinx to omit members when `__all__` is empty, it needs to explicitly check the `__all__` list and use it to filter what gets added to `members`. The absence of this check is likely causing all members to be included regardless of `__all__`.

Since the `__all__` logic is not present in `get_module_members`, this hints at either the need for modification within this method to incorporate `__all__` handling or the necessity to trace where and how `members` from this method is later processed. This isn't the execution of explicit filtering based on `__all__`, indicating that the core logic or invocation responsible for using `__all__` must be elsewhere.

Given this understanding, the next logical step is to identify where the `members` returned by `get_module_members` are used for filtering or should be filtered according to the `__all__` attribute.

Observed method: `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:ModuleDocumenter.filter_members`
==================================================
The `Documenter.filter_members` method is responsible for deciding which of the members should be documented, implementing numerous filters to exclude certain members based on conditions like privacy, special methods, exclusion options, and member type. The key logic related to the `__all__` attribute seems to be missing; there's no explicit handling of this leading to the documentation of all module members regardless of `__all__`.

Here's a focused analysis of current logic and behavior:

### Current Logic:
- The method starts by checking various conditions and exclusion filters provided through options or metadata to decide if a member should be documented (lines 741-785).
- Specific filtering is implemented for special members and attributes using internally managed conditions (lines 748-784).
- The `autodoc-skip-member` event is emitted, allowing user-defined extensions to further influence the decision to keep or skip members (lines 793-800).

### Observed Behavior:
The method documents all members without appropriately handling `__all__`, which should restrict the set of members being considered for documentation. The filtering conditions rely primarily on privacy, documentation existence, and explicit inclusion/exclusion options.

### Missing Logic:
The filtering does not include any logic concerning the `__all__` attribute, which should specify public API components and help prevent documenting unsupported members when `__all__` is empty.

Given the absence of any reference to `__all__`, the following steps could involve inserting logic that respects an empty `__all__` by extending current filtering or tracing further for how the `members` list is pre-processed. A possible strategy would be to adjust member selection based on the module's `__all__`.

To obtain further insights on any deeper logic or invocation context, it's valuable to inspect the point where `members` are assembled, confirming that they do not bypass `__all__` handling or adjusting this method accordingly.

Therefore, the next step is to further observe the specifics of member filtering logic within the current method that could be influenced by `__all__`.

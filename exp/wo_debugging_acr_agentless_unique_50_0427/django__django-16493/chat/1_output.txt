To resolve this issue, I need to make sure I understand how the `deconstruct` method is implemented for the `FileField`. The problem lies in how this method decides whether to include the `storage` argument when the storage is callable and can potentially return `default_storage`.

Since I need to understand the implementation of `deconstruct` for the `FileField`, I will search for this method and review its logic.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("FileField.deconstruct")
```

To address the issue where autodoc is ignoring the empty `__all__` attribute, I'll need to investigate how autodoc processes the `__all__` attribute and handles module members.

First, I will search for the relevant method or class in the Sphinx codebase that processes module members and the `__all__` attribute, potentially within the autodoc extension. 

I will specifically look for any logic related to handling the `__all__` attribute and filtering members based on its contents. 

```python
search_method_in_codebase("autodoc")
search_method_in_codebase("process_docstring")
search_method_in_codebase("filter_members")
search_code_in_codebase("__all__")
```

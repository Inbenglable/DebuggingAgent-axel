To determine whether the issue is fixed, let's break down the provided information:

### Patch Analysis
The patch modifies the behavior of how indices are prepended during the simplification process in the `kahane_simplify` function. Specifically, it stops reversing the `prepend_indices` before combining them with `resulting_indices`.

### Test Output Analysis
#### Original Output
- The test originally printed:
  ```
  4*GammaMatrix(rho)*GammaMatrix(sigma)
  4*GammaMatrix(sigma)*GammaMatrix(rho)
  ```
- It raised an `AssertionError` because the order of `GammaMatrix(sigma)` and `GammaMatrix(rho)` was flipped in the second case.

#### Patched Output
- Even after the patch, it prints:
  ```
  4*GammaMatrix(rho)*GammaMatrix(sigma)
  4*GammaMatrix(sigma)*GammaMatrix(rho)
  ```
- The test still raises an `AssertionError`, indicating the order of gamma matrices remains incorrect in the second test case.

### Conclusion
The output indicates that the problem with the order of leading gamma matrices not being preserved is still present. The patch did not resolve the issue, as evidenced by the unchanged output and the continued assertion failure.

Issue resolved: `False`

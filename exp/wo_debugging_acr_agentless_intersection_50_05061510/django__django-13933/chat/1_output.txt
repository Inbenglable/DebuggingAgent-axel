To resolve the issue, I need to check the implementation details of the `ModelChoiceField` and likely the surrounding code where the validation error for `invalid_choice` is raised. This will involve retrieving the source code for the `ModelChoiceField` class to understand where the changes can be made.

Since I need to identify the file that contains the `ModelChoiceField` class, I'll use the API call dedicated for searching classes in the codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ModelChoiceField")
```

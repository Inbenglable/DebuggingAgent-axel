I have enough information to address the problem and generate a patch. The main issue is caused by incorrect handling of whitespace when appending suffixes for columns in SQL statements. The `Columns.__str__` method should be adjusted to manage whitespace appropriately when forming the column and suffix combination.

Given the provided `_create_index_sql` method implementations and the `Columns.__str__` method, I will proceed with generating a patch to correct the whitespace issue. 

Ready generation: `True`

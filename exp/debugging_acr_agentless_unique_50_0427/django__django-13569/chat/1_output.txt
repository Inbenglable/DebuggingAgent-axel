The provided script is attempting to execute a Django test case based on a given issue, but it is encountering an error related to the Django application registry: `django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet.`

This exception typically occurs when the Django application registry isn't fully initialized before trying to interact with models or run tests. This situation is often due to not properly setting up or loading the Django application configurations before using models.

In Django, before using models and app configurations properly, you should ensure that Django has fully initialized its applications. This is usually managed by Django when running through its management commands or test runners but needs explicit handling in standalone scripts.

The key points to consider are:
1. How settings are configured and ensured to be fully loaded.
2. Initializing Django applications before interacting with models or running migrations.

Given the current setup in the script, the configuration occurs before setting up applications. The `AppRegistryNotReady` exception suggests that the application registry check (`apps.get_containing_app_config(module)`) fails because apps are not loaded at the time of model class construction.

### Analysis:
- **Configuration Issue:** The script uses `settings.configure(...)` directly, but this needs to be followed by `django.setup()` to ensure apps are ready.
- **Model Interaction:** Interacting with models before `django.setup()` is called results in the observed error.

### Conclusion:
The issue arises from the flow of execution where Django's application registry isn't initialized. To resolve this, the test environment setup should include initializing Django's apps using `django.setup()` after `settings.configure(...)`.

I will proceed to identify the exact code path responsible for handling model registry and initializations.

### Next Step:
I will trace the application setup to ensure that the ordering and initialization match expectations, potentially affecting the application registry and model construction.

Observed method: `django.apps.registry:Apps.check_apps_ready`

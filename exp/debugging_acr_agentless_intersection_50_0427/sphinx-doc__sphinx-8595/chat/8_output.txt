To generate the patch, I need to retrieve the source code of the `ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members` method from the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file, as this method contains the buggy logic related to handling the empty `__all__` attribute.

Let's proceed to retrieve the source code for this method.

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py", "ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members")
```

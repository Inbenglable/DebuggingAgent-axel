To address the issue with the `units.quantity_input` decorator in the **astropy** project, it is necessary to examine the relevant source code for this decorator. The error suggests that there is an attempt to call the `to` method on a `NoneType` object when a function or method with a return type of `None` is decorated with `@u.quantity_input`. We need to inspect the source code of the `quantity_input` decorator and the relevant sections where return values are processed.

I will search for the `quantity_input` decorator in the codebase to understand its implementation and identify where the return type annotation might be causing issues.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("quantity_input")
```

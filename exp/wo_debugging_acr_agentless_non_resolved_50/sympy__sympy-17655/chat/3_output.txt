To resolve the issue, the main concern is with the `__add__` method of the `Point` class, which raises an exception when handling multiplication with a `Point` and a scalar in different order. The `__mul__` method only handles multiplication, but does not affect how addition is handled in `__add__`.

To ensure consistent behavior regardless of order, we may need to modify the `__add__` method to handle cases where the `other` operand is a `Mul` object containing a scalar and a `Point`.

I have already retrieved the necessary source code for the methods in question: `Point.__add__` and `Point.__mul__`. This information is sufficient to generate a patch to fix the described issue. 

Ready generation: `True`

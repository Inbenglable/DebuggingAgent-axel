The error is occurring in the `ax.bar` method when handling NaN values. To resolve this, I need to examine the implementation of the `bar` method within the `Axes` class in the `matplotlib` library to understand how this issue might be patched. Therefore, I need to search for the source code of the `Axes.bar` method.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("Axes.bar")
```

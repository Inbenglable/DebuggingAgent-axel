To resolve the issue of `timesince()` raising a `TypeError` due to a mix of naive and aware datetime objects when `USE_TZ=True`, we need to ensure that the timezone information is handled correctly when creating the pivot datetime object. This involves adjusting the code in `timesince.py` where the pivot datetime is created.

I'll generate the necessary patch using the following steps:

1. Modify the pivot datetime creation code to include the timezone information (`tzinfo`) from the original datetime object `d`.

Here is the required search/replace edit to fix the issue:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/utils/timesince.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        )\n=======\n            tzinfo=d.tzinfo,\n        )\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This edit ensures that the pivot datetime retains the timezone information from the original datetime object `d`, thus preventing the `TypeError` caused by subtracting offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes. The functionality of the code remains unchanged except for correcting the timezone issue.

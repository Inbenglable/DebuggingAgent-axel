From the provided information, it appears that the program is encountering an error due to an invalid comparison involving the imaginary unit \( I \) inside the SymPy library. The error stack trace suggests that the issue arises when attempting to simplify expressions, particularly involving trigonometric functions raised to complex powers. 

The error occurs deep in the SymPy simplification process, specifically in a function related to trigonometric simplification (_TR56 function inside the `fu.py` module). The error message "Invalid comparison of complex I" indicates that there is a comparison being performed where it's not appropriate because the exponent is a complex number.

The error traceback leads us through several methods to land in:

```
File "/home/e/se/sympy/simplify/fu.py", line 504, in _f
    if (rv.exp < 0) == True:
File "/home/e/se/sympy/core/expr.py", line 406, in __lt__
    raise TypeError("Invalid comparison of complex %s" % me)
```

This suggests that while processing the expression, an attempt is made to compare the exponent of a trigonometric function (in this case, the imaginary unit \( I \)) with zero, which is not valid. 

There is a suspicious comparison in the `_f` method where it attempts to evaluate if an exponent is less than 0. This is likely where the bug is, as comparing a complex number using less-than is not valid, causing the error to surface.

Since we are tracing back the origin of the erroneous behavior through the call stack, let's confirm the location of the buggy line before deciding on a fix.

Observed method: `sympy/simplify/fu.py:_f`

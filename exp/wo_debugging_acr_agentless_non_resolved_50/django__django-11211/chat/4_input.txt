## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Prefetch related is not working when used GFK for model that uses UUID field as PK.
Description
	
How to reproduce:
create model with UUID as primary key
class Foo(models.Model):
	id = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False)
	...
create another model with GFK to model Foo
class Bar(models.Model):
	foo_content_type = models.ForeignKey(
		ContentType, related_name='actor',
		on_delete=models.CASCADE, db_index=True
	)
	foo_object_id = models.CharField(max_length=255, db_index=True)
	foo = GenericForeignKey('foo_content_type', 'foo_object_id')
	...
and try to get queryset with prefetch related (django orm engine return None for attribute foo):
Bar.objects.all().prefetch_related('foo')
Thanks a lot for your attention! Also i wanna point out some related bug report from third party library in which previously i faced with that issue, maybe it would useful – ​https://github.com/justquick/django-activity-stream/issues/245

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To address the issue, it appears that the problem lies in how Django's ORM handles prefetching of GenericForeignKey relationships when the primary key is a UUID field. Specifically, the conversion between UUID objects and their string representations might be causing the problem.

A typical approach to fix such a problem would be to ensure that the `foo_object_id` field stores the UUID in its canonical string format, and any retrieval operations correctly interpret this format as a UUID, especially when those operations interact with the ContentType framework.

Before generating a patch, I need to:

1. Explore Django's ORM prefetch-related and how it interacts with GenericForeignKey fields.
2. Check any relevant utilities or methods in Django's source code that manage GenericForeignKeys, especially how they convert between UUID and string, which might not be directly evident without understanding the framework's internals.

Therefore, I need to explore the Django source code related to GenericForeignKey and the prefetch_related functionality.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("GenericForeignKey")
search_method_in_codebase("prefetch_related")
search_code_in_codebase("UUIDField")

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

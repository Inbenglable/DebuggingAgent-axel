Based on the issue description, the problem lies specifically with the `format` method found in `django/utils/numberformat.py`. The problem involves how `format` renders small decimals using scientific notation due to a hardcoded cut-off point. It doesn't pertain to date formatting in any way.

I'll analyze each API returned content:

1. #### django/utils/dateformat.py:format
   - This method is a convenience function for date formatting. It is unrelated to the issue of number formatting.
   
2. #### django/utils/numberformat.py:format
   - This method directly deals with the formatting of numbers, including the use of scientific notation for very small decimals and matches the context provided in the issue description.

From the analysis, the relevant file to review and modify is:
```
django/utils/numberformat.py:format
```

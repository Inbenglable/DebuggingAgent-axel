## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Adding nullable OneToOneField crashes on SQLite.
Description
	
This new sqlite3 error has cropped up between building django-oauth-toolkit between Django 4.0 and main branch for migrations.AddField of a OneToOneField (see â€‹https://github.com/jazzband/django-oauth-toolkit/issues/1064):
self = <django.db.backends.sqlite3.base.SQLiteCursorWrapper object at 0x10b8038b0>
query = 'ALTER TABLE "oauth2_provider_accesstoken" ADD COLUMN "source_refresh_token_id" bigint NULL UNIQUE REFERENCES "oauth2_provider_refreshtoken" ("id") DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED'
params = []
	def execute(self, query, params=None):
		if params is None:
			return Database.Cursor.execute(self, query)
		query = self.convert_query(query)
>	 return Database.Cursor.execute(self, query, params)
E	 django.db.utils.OperationalError: Cannot add a UNIQUE column
Here's the relevant migration snippet: 
		migrations.AddField(
			model_name='AccessToken',
			name='source_refresh_token',
			field=models.OneToOneField(blank=True, null=True, on_delete=django.db.models.deletion.SET_NULL, to=oauth2_settings.REFRESH_TOKEN_MODEL, related_name="refreshed_access_token"),
		),
I see there have been a lot of sqlite3 changes in #33355 since the 4.0 release....

In the previous round, you called search APIs to retrieve relevant source code that would help identify the root cause of the issue and generate a patch. However, the code you retrieved appears in multiple locations (maybe some are irrelevant but have same key). So now your task is to determine which of the retrieved contents are indeed you need, and filter out the irrelevant ones.
This is your API invocation round output:
The issue is related to an `OperationalError` when trying to add a `OneToOneField` using SQLite3. In general, this issue stems from SQLite's inability to add a unique column after the table has been created.

To resolve this issue, I first need to explore potential fixes or workarounds that have been discussed or implemented in the Django codebase, especially concerning adding unique constraints in SQLite. This would involve understanding how Django manages schema alterations and any related methods. Specifically, I will need to examine the methods that handle `OneToOneField` creation in SQLite migrations.

Let's start by looking into the Django codebase to investigate how schema alterations involving unique columns are handled in SQLite databases. I will search for implementations or references to SQL ALTER TABLE operations that add unique columns and how Django's migration system processes these operations.

To proceed with this, I will search for relevant methods or classes likely involved with this functionality.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("add_field")
search_class_in_codebase("SchemaEditor")
search_method_in_codebase("execute")
```

These searches will give me an insight into the schema alteration, specifically `ALTER TABLE` operations and how SQLite might be treated differently for such cases in Django. With this, I'll gather the required information to generate a patch.

Now, please first analyze the API returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.

Then you need to choose you needed ones with the following format:

Note:
1. The value of FILE_PATH:NAME, must consistent with the API returned content (but remove the prefix ####).
2. You may select one or more contents, or even all of them if they are indeed you need.

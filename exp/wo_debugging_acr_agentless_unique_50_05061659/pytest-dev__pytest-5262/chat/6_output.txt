To determine whether the issue is resolved, let's evaluate both the patch and the test outputs.

### Patch Review:
The patch modifies the `__getattr__` method in the file `src/_pytest/capture.py`. Specifically, it adds a conditional statement to check if the `name` attribute is `mode`. If it is, it replaces `b` with an empty string in the mode string (e.g., changing `rb+` to `r+`).

```python
def __getattr__(self, name):
    attr = getattr(object.__getattribute__(self, "buffer"), name)
    if name == 'mode':
        return attr.replace('b', '')
    return attr
```

This patch is directly related to the issue because the error arose when `youtube-dl` was attempting to write bytes to a stream that advertised a binary mode due to the `b` character in its mode.

### Test Output Before and After Patch:
Both before and after applying the patch, the output:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'youtube_dl'
```

The output indicates that the module `youtube_dl` is not found during test execution, suggesting that the test environment does not have `youtube_dl` installed. The reproduced test is failing before it can even evaluate whether the patch fixes the initial issue, because it cannot import `youtube_dl`.

### Conclusion:
The patch itself seems to be a correct attempt to fix the issue by altering how the `mode` attribute is reported by `_pytest.capture.EncodedFile` objects. However, the reproducible test fails to run due to a missing dependency, which is unrelated to whether the patch works.

Therefore, we cannot conclusively determine if the issue is resolved from the test outputs provided because the testing environment setup is incorrect.

Issue resolved: `False`

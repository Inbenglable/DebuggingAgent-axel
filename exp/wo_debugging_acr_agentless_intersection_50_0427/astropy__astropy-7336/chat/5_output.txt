To address the issue with the `units.quantity_input` decorator failing for constructors with type hinted return value `None`, I need to retrieve the source code related to the `QuantityInput.as_decorator` method and its wrapper function. This will allow me to understand how return annotations are processed, and how a check can be added for `NoneType`.

Here are the steps to gather the necessary information:

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/units/decorators.py", "QuantityInput.as_decorator")
search_method_in_file("astropy/units/decorators.py", "wrapper")
search_class_in_file("astropy/units/decorators.py", "QuantityInput")
```

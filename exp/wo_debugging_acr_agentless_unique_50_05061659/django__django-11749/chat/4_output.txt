The original issue describes a problem where `call_command` does not handle mutually exclusive groups properly when arguments are passed in via keyword arguments (kwargs), but handles them correctly when passed as command-line arguments.

### Review of the Patch

**Patch Logic:**
- The patch changes how `call_command` constructs the list of arguments to pass to the parser.
- It checks if the action is part of a mutually exclusive group and if the group is required, correctly handling the passing of keyword arguments when at least one argument in the required group is present.

### Analysis of the Test Output

**Original Output:**
- The original output shows a `CommandError` indicating "Unknown command: 'command'." This suggests there was an issue with how the custom command was registered or called in the test setup.

**Patched Output:**
- The patched output is identical to the original output, with the same `CommandError` and `AssertionError`.
- This indicates that the patch did not resolve the issue, as the error related to mutually exclusive groups is still present.

### Conclusion

The patch logic appears to address the problem described in the issue, but the test results show no change in behavior after applying the patch. This suggests that the underlying issue might lie elsewhere, such as in how the test is constructed or a different part of the command registration mechanism.

Therefore, based on the unchanged test output, the issue is not yet resolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

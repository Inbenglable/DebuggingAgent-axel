Analyzing the provided code and the abnormal behavior indicates that the issue arises due to incorrect usage or definition of the `captured_output` function.

The error message states:

```
TypeError: captured_output() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given
```

From the traceback, it's evident that the call:
```python
with captured_output('stdout', 'stderr') as (out, err):
```

is causing this error because it passes two arguments, `stdout` and `stderr`, to a function or context manager named `captured_output` which is defined to accept only one positional argument. 

The definition of `captured_output` is imported from `django.test.utils`. To locate the issue, we need to observe how `captured_output` is defined to understand what arguments it expects.

Thus, to trace the issue further, we should observe the method where `captured_output` is defined.

Observed method: `django/test/utils.py:captured_output`

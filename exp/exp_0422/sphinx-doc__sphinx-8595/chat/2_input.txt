You are a debugging agent tasked with precisely using tools to resolve issues and submit pull requests.

**Current Task:**  
Resolve the following issue in the sphinx project:
#### ISSUE
autodoc: empty __all__ attribute is ignored
**Describe the bug**
autodoc: empty `__all__` attribute is ignored

**To Reproduce**
```
# example.py
__all__ = []


def foo():
    "docstring"


def bar():
    "docstring"


def baz():
    "docstring"
```
```
# index.rst
.. automodule:: example
   :members:
```

All foo, bar, and baz are shown.

**Expected behavior**
No entries should be shown because `__all__` is empty.

**Your project**
No

**Screenshots**
No

**Environment info**
- OS: Mac
- Python version: 3.9.1
- Sphinx version: HEAD of 3.x
- Sphinx extensions: sphinx.ext.autodoc
- Extra tools: No

**Additional context**
No


Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:

import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))

project = 'Test'
copyright = '2023'
author = 'Test'

extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc']

**Test Execution Results:**



Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

1. Create a minimal debugging test based on the reproduce test.
2. Debug by reviewing the relevant source code and monitoring runtime information.
3. Once you have identified the root cause, modify the code with minimal changes.
4. Rerun the reproduction script to confirm that the issue is fixed.

Focus on Step 1: generate a debugging test. At the end of your analysis, provide the specific code in the following **JSON format**.
Note: You should clearly specify the tests you are debugging as much as possible. Minimizing the amount of code will better assist you in analyzing runtime information later.


{
"debugging_test" : "import ... # Your debugging test code here"
}

The issue described involves ensuring that the "Save as new" functionality in the Django admin only appears when the user has the necessary add permissions. The expected behavior is that "Save as new" should only be shown when a user has both add and change permissions.

Let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Original Test Output**:
   - The "Save as new" button was incorrectly shown even when the user did not have the add permission.
   - This indicates a clear failure to check for the add permission, which is consistent with the reported issue.

2. **Patch Analysis**:
   - The patch added a check for `has_add_permission` to the context variable `show_save_as_new` in `django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py`.
   - This change directly addresses the issue by ensuring that "Save as new" is only shown when the user has the `add` permission.

3. **Patched Test Output**:
   - After applying the patch, the test output shows that all test cases pass:
     - The button is not shown when the add permission is missing.
     - The button is shown when both change and add permissions are present.
     - The button is hidden when `save_as` is False, independent of user permissions.

The patched test output matches the expected behavior of having the "Save as new" button appear only when appropriate permissions are granted.

Considering these points, the patch successfully resolves the issue as described. Therefore:

Issue resolved: `True`

To properly handle the `set` and `dict` types, we need to implement specific methods such as `_print_set` and `_print_dict` in the `ReprPrinter` class. We need to ensure that these types are printed using SymPy's `FiniteSet` and `Dict` representations, respectively.

First, I need to check if there are similar print methods already implemented in the `ReprPrinter` class or associated files that deal with `FiniteSet` and `Dict` explicitly.

I'll retrieve the source code for the `ReprPrinter` class to identify any helper methods and see the current handling for such types. Once the code for the class is obtained, I'll have sufficient context to build and implement the new methods.

```python
search_class_in_file("sympy/printing/printer.py", "ReprPrinter")
search_code_in_file("sympy/printing/printer.py", "FiniteSet")
search_code_in_file("sympy/printing/printer.py", "Dict")
```

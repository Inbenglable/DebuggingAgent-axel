To address the issue, I'm going to need to inspect the `_check_homomorphism` function, specifically within the context defined in the issueâ€”this involves PermutationGroups and the internal `_image()` function. I assume these are part of the `homomorphisms` module within the SymPy `combinatorics` library.

Since the issue mentioned the `_image()` function's handling of `PermutationGroup`, I should first locate and review this function. Therefore, I need to retrieve the relevant source code.

I'll proceed to search for the `_image` method in the `homomorphisms.py` file and, if necessary, for its containing method, `_check_homomorphism`.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py", "_image")
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py", "_check_homomorphism")
```

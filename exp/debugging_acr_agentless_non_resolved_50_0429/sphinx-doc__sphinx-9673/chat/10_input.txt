<ISSUE>
autodoc_typehints_description_target not working with Napoleon
### Describe the bug

I was trying to use the config option `autodoc_typehints_description_target = "documented"` combined with the Napoleon plugin (using Google style).

The return types were missing from the resulting documentation.



### How to Reproduce

Just generate the documentation using Napoleon and the config options:
```python
autodoc_typehints = "description"
autodoc_typehints_description_target = "documented"

napoleon_numpy_docstring = False
```

Generate the documentation of a function with the following docstring:

```
"""
Description.

Parameters:
    param1: First parameter.
    param2: Second parameter.

Returns:
    The returned value.

"""
```

### Expected behavior

As the return is specified, the return type should be present in the documentation, either as a rtype section or as part of the return description.

This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
To analyze and trace the issue, we will need to identify the sequence of calls and configurations affecting how Sphinx processes the documentation, especially the handling of autodoc type hints and integration with Napoleon.

Let's start by observing how these configuration options are parsed and utilized by the Sphinx application, specifically focusing on the initial configuration phase where extensions and options are set up.

Observed method: `sphinx/application.py:Sphinx.__init__`
==================================================
To resolve this issue, we need to understand how Sphinx generates documentation, particularly with the interaction of the `autodoc` and `napoleon` extensions.

The observed abnormal behavior is that the "Returns:" section is missing from the generated documentation. This suggests that the handling of type hints and integration with Google-style docstrings provided by the `napoleon` extension might not be working as intended.

The Sphinx class' initialization method `Sphinx.__init__` shows us the loading and setting up of extensions, but doesn't directly relate to where the type hint description should be processed. We need to identify where the processing of type hints occurs especially in conjunction with Google-style docstrings that `napoleon` uses.

Given the configuration used involves `autodoc` for processing type hints and `napoleon` for Google-style docstring formats, the integration or usage of these might be missing or flawed:

1. Ensure the auto-documentation of functions is capturing the return type information as dictated by `autodoc_typehints_description_target`.
2. Check how `napoleon` processes the Google-style docstrings, particularly how it handles sections like "Returns".

The failure in the test indicates:
- `autodoc` might not be capturing or appropriately incorporating the `napoleon` processed docstring.
- The configuration options might not be correctly connected to ensure return details are included.

The next step is to look more deeply into how Sphinx processes these configurations with `autodoc` and `napoleon`. We should consider inspecting how the Sphinx extensions are set up, processed, and then utilized during documentation builds.

I will continue tracing by examining the scope where extensions like `autodoc` and `napoleon` are set up and utilized:

Observed scope: `sphinx/application.py:232-237`
==================================================
The observed code snippet in `Sphinx.__init__` sets up extensions for the Sphinx application. These extensions are crucial for customizing the behavior of the documentation generation process. The issue seems to be related to the interaction between the `autodoc` and `napoleon` extensions, specifically in how autodoc type hints are processed with Google-style docstrings.

From the runtime information, it seems the extensions are loaded correctly, but the expected behavior of type hint processing isn't happening as described in the issue.

Given the complexity of the problem and the fact that we need to see how these extensions interact during the documentation building process, the next logical step is to observe how type hints are handled during autodoc processing. This typically occurs during the rendering of individual docstrings, where autodoc and napoleon collaborate.

Thus, the next step would be to observe where `autodoc` processes type hints in conjunction with `napoleon`. I will proceed to examine the autodocumentation process that should setup and utilize these configurations:

Observed method: `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:Documenter.add_directive_header`
==================================================
The current observed method is `Documenter.add_directive_header`. This method constructs the directive header and options for the Sphinx documentation blocks. It's responsible for forming the structure into which the docstrings should be inserted.

The runtime information indicates an issue where a warning is raised about the module not being identified for the `sample_function`. Additionally, the test fails at the assertion due to the missing "Returns:" section in the generated documentation. This points to a potential problem in how the docstrings are integrated into the documentation block during the autodocumentation process.

Given that the abnormal behavior stems from missing sections in the documentation, the integration of the docstring's sections (like "Returns") could be mishandled or omitted. Considering the importance of `add_directive_header` and its role in structuring the documentation:

1. We need to ensure that autodoc options, such as capturing type hints and their descriptions, are properly added in this header.
2. The Google-style docstring processing by `napoleon` might not be properly integrating with autodoc features needed for return type inclusion.

To further inspect the handling of type hints and content addition to the documentation, letâ€™s move deeper into the method where lines are being added, focusing on how sections like "Returns" might be mishandled.

Next, I will trace the deeper downstream portions where lines are added by choosing to observe the section implicated in handling content addition within this method:

Observed scope: `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:545-553`
==================================================


Now you choose Documenter.add_directive_header's code snippet 
   545	            if i == 0:
   546	                prefix = " " * len(prefix)
   547	
   548	        if self.options.noindex:
   549	            self.add_line('   :noindex:', sourcename)
   550	        if self.objpath:
   551	            # Be explicit about the module, this is necessary since .. class::
   552	            # etc. don't support a prepended module name
   553	            self.add_line('   :module: %s' % self.modname, sourcename)

for further observation, tracing the abnormal program behavior.

This is the runtime information of the code snippet you choose to observed in Documenter.add_directive_header:

In order to resolve the issue of adding `get/set_antialiased` methods to the Text objects in the matplotlib library, I need to analyze and gather relevant source code to understand how other artist objects implement these methods. This will involve searching for existing implementations of `set_antialiased` and `get_antialiased` for guidance and also searching for `Text` class to identify where and how to add these methods.

Let's first locate the `Text` class and explore its current implementation. We also need to check if there are existing implementations in other classes related to artists that we can use to guide the integration for `Text`.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Text")
search_method_in_codebase("set_antialiased")
search_method_in_codebase("get_antialiased")
```

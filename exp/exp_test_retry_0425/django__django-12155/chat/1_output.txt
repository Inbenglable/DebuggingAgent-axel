The observed abnormal behavior is an `ImportError`, indicating that the Python script is attempting to import a non-existent function, `simplify_exception`, from `django.contrib.admindocs.views`. This suggests that the `simplify_exception` function has either been removed from this module or doesn't exist in the expected location.

Additionally, the root issue relates to the `trim_docstring` function in the `django.contrib.admindocs.utils` module. The issue describes how `trim_docstring` incorrectly processes docstrings that do not start with an empty line. The provided error trace indicates that this function might not be correctly handling the given input.

Targets for inspection:
1. Confirm the existence or absence of the `simplify_exception` function definition.
2. Review the `trim_docstring` implementation to identify any specific bugs in handling non-empty first-line docstrings.

Since the trace mentions an issue with `trim_docstring`, let's take a closer look at its implementation:

Observed method: `django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py:trim_docstring`

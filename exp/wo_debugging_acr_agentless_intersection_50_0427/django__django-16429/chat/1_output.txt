To address the issue, I need to modify the part of the code in the `timesince.py` file where the pivot is instantiated, taking into consideration the `tzinfo` of the datetime object. To make these changes, I should retrieve the source code of the relevant portion within the `timesince` function or the relevant part of the codebase related to the issue. Let's search for the `timesince` method in the `django/utils/timesince.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/utils/timesince.py", "timesince")
```

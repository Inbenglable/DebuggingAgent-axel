To resolve the issue with incorrect parenthesizing of `Subs` expressions in LaTeX output, we're specifically interested in the LaTeX printing method related to `Subs`. From the provided API results, none of the methods listed appear to involve `Subs` or alterations to `Subs` expression types. The `_latex` methods listed belong to various classes in different modules, including quantum mechanics, vectors, and other specific functionalities unrelated to `Subs`.

The `_print_Subs` method was not returned in the search results, which indicates that the function actually responsible for handling the LaTeX printing of `Subs` is missing from the provided list. Therefore, none of the contents returned by the search for `Subs._latex` are directly needed to solve the given issue.

Based on the analysis above, there are no relevant contents from the API results to select, implying that we need to broaden our search to either find the correct method in the SymPy codebase that relates to the `Subs` object's LaTeX printing or investigate further into how `Subs` is being printed to LaTeX in the current SymPy implementation.

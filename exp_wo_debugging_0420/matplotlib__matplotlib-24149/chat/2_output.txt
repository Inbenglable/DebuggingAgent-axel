To determine which pieces of code are relevant for addressing the issue with the `ax.bar` method raising an error for all-NaN input data, I'll analyze each of the returned results based on their content and their relevance to the issue at hand.

### Analyzing the returned results:

1. **lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py:Axes3D.bar**
   - This function is related to adding 2D bars in a 3D plot using `Axes3D`. The issue described is specific to 2D bar plots using the `ax.bar` method. While the method is conceptually related (both create bar plots), this specific implementation is not directly relevant to the bug in the 2D `Axes.bar` method.

2. **lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py:bar**
   - This is a utility function from the `pyplot` module meant to simplify the process of creating bar plots by calling `gca().bar(...)`. It internally calls the `Axes.bar` method, but the core logic of handling the bars is not defined here. Hence, while it is related, the core issue lies within the `Axes.bar` method itself.

3. **lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py:Axes.bar**
   - This is the method directly related to the `Axes.bar` function which is responsible for creating 2D bar plots. This is the location that contains the detailed logic and implementation of how bars are created, and is likely where the issue, or the handling of NaN values which results in the error, needs to be fixed.

### Conclusion:
The `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py:Axes.bar` content is directly relevant and necessary for resolving the issue related to `ax.bar` handling of NaN values. The other files, while related conceptually or by function calls, do not contain the core logic that needs to be addressed.

Here's the list of the needed content:

```
lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py:Axes.bar
```

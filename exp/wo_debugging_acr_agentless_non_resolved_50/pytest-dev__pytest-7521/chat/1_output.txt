To address this issue, I need to investigate how the `capfd` fixture and the `readouterr` method work within the `pytest` codebase. Specifically, I need to determine why `\r` is being converted to `\n` in pytest 6.0.0rc1.

To do this, I'll need to locate and examine the relevant source code for the `capfd` fixture and the `readouterr` method. Once I identify where the conversion might be occurring, I can make the necessary adjustments.

Let me start by searching for these elements in the source code.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("capfd")
search_method_in_codebase("readouterr")
```

To resolve the issue, I'll need to modify the code snippet retrieved to prevent the `to` method call when the return annotation is `None`. The small code segment involved indicates that the problematic line lies within a context manager, which is intended for handling unit equivalencies. Since no further analysis is needed for the surrounding implementation, I can proceed with generating the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

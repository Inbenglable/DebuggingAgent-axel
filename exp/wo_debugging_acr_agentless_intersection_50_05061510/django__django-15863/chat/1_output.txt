To resolve the issue, I need to examine the source code of the `floatformat` template filter because the problem involves its conversion handling with Decimal numbers. Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code of this filter to understand the logic and determine where the conversion occurs.

Since I don't currently know the file in which `floatformat` is implemented, I'll search for it within the entire codebase:

```python
search_method_in_codebase("floatformat")
```

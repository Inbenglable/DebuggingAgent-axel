To address the issue, I need to understand how `pytest` handles skipped tests, particularly when the `--pdb` flag is used. The behavior should ideally skip the execution of `tearDown` for skipped tests. 

Investigating relevant parts of the code where test case execution and handling with options like `--pdb` could be managed might shed light on the problem. I need to start by searching for components that deal with handling the end of a test execution (`tearDown`), especially relating to the TestCase from unittest when marked as skipped.

I will begin by looking for the part of the code that processes the unittest's `TestCase` or `tearDown` method tagging a test as skipped in pytest, and check how the `--pdb` option affects this.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("TestCaseFunction")
search_method_in_codebase("pytest_pyfunc_call")
search_code_in_codebase("pytest --pdb")
search_method_in_codebase("pytest_configure")
```

Based on the analysis of the trace and the error, we have identified an issue with the line `X_non_outliers = -axis0_safe_slice(X, ~outliers_mask, n_non_outliers)` in the method `_huber_loss_and_gradient` within `sklearn/linear_model/huber.py`. Specifically, the problem arises because when `X` is a boolean array, attempting to apply the negation operator (`-`) results in a `TypeError`.

Since the trace details indicate the specific line where the error occurs, I can conclude that the buggy method has been identified.

Buggy method: `sklearn/linear_model/huber.py:_huber_loss_and_gradient`

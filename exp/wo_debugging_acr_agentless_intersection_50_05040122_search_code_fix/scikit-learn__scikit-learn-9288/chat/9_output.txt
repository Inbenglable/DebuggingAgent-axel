Upon reviewing the patch and analyzing the test outputs before and after applying the patch, it's clear that the output remains unchanged. The test still fails with an `AssertionError`, indicating a mismatch between the inertia values for `n_jobs=1` and `n_jobs=2`. 

The patch was intended to set a consistent random seed for both parallel and single-threaded runs to ensure reproducibility of results. However, the test results indicate that the inconsistency between the inertia values persists, suggesting that the issue has not been resolved.

Therefore, the issue is not fixed.

Issue resolved: `False`

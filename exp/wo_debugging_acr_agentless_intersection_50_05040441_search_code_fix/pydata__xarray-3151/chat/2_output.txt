Based on the information provided, the issue is related to the `combine_by_coords` function in the `xarray/core/combine.py` file. The problem arises when identical coordinates that are non-monotonic raise a `ValueError`. The current implementation checks if the indexes of the concatenated datasets are monotonically increasing or decreasing and raises an error if they aren't.

To address this issue, we need to modify the part of the code that checks for monotonicity to skip the check for coordinate dimensions that do not vary between the datasets.

We already have the source code for the `combine_by_coords` function. So, I'm ready to generate the patch to fix the issue.

Ready generation: `True`

To create a minimal debugging test, we need to focus on isolating the behavior of the `separability_matrix` function when dealing with nested compound models. The key is to keep our test concise and focused on the problematic aspect.

Here is the debugging test code:

```python
from astropy.modeling import models as m
from astropy.modeling.separable import separability_matrix

# Debugging test for nested compound models
def test_separability_matrix():
    # Create a simple compound model
    cm = m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)
    
    # Test separability matrix for nested compound models
    nested_cm = m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm
    result = separability_matrix(nested_cm)
    
    print("Nested Compound Model Separability Matrix:")
    print(result)
    
test_separability_matrix()
```

This test focuses specifically on the creation of a nested compound model and the resulting separability matrix, which is where the issue is observed.

```json
{
"debugging_test" : "from astropy.modeling import models as m\nfrom astropy.modeling.separable import separability_matrix\n\ndef test_separability_matrix():\n    cm = m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)\n    nested_cm = m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm\n    result = separability_matrix(nested_cm)\n    print(\"Nested Compound Model Separability Matrix:\")\n    print(result)\n\ntest_separability_matrix()"
}
```

Based on the traces provided:
1. **Issue Identified:** The problem occurs because `should_be_coords` is determined by intersecting `window_dim` with `self.obj.coords`, which does not account for non-dimensional coordinates.
2. **Current Behavior:** The minimal example demonstrates that 'day', which was a coordinate, is being classified as a variable post-coarsening due to the current logic in `should_be_coords`.
3. **Key Observation:** The `should_be_coords` variable calculation formula is designed in a way that coordinates not associated with the dimensions described in `window_dim` are omitted.
4. **Bug Location:** From the traces and observations, the miscalculation happens in the `Coarsen.construct` method in the `set(window_dim) & set(self.obj.coords)` logic.

Given this analysis, the buggy method is apparent:
Buggy method: `xarray/core/rolling.py:DatasetCoarsen.construct`

To resolve this issue, we should revise how `should_be_coords` is determined to include all coordinates originally present in `self.obj.coords`, not just those associated with the `window_dim`. The fix would involve ensuring all original non-dimensional coordinates are retained when constructing the new dimensions.

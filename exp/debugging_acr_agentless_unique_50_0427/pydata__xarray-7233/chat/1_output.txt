Based on the output, we can see the following observations:

1. The original `DataArray` named `da` has a coordinate called `'day'`, which is set by the `assign_coords` method.
2. The problem arises after executing `ds.coarsen(time=12).construct(time=("year", "month"))`. The `'day'` coordinate is converted (or "demoted") into a variable, hence it does not appear in `result.coords` which is expected in the AssertionError.
3. The execution trace indicates that the issue might stem from the processing in the `rolling.py` file, specifically within the `Coarsen.construct` method. While iterating over the `obj.variables` items, it should ensure that originally designated coordinates are also treated as coordinates in the resulting Dataset, but it places the `day` as a variable instead.

Based on the observations, the next step is to identify why the coordinate is not preserved. The method `Coarsen.construct` seems relevant as it deals with constructing the coarsened dataset.

Observed method: `xarray/core/rolling.py:Coarsen.construct`

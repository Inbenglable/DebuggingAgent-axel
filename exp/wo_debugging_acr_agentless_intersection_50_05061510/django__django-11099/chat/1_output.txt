To resolve this issue, I need to make changes to the regular expressions used in the `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator`. Since these validators are likely implemented in Django's `contrib.auth.validators` module, I should first retrieve their source code to understand how they are currently implemented and to make the necessary adjustments.

Given the information provided, I'll need to locate these classes in the codebase and review their definitions.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ASCIIUsernameValidator")
search_class_in_codebase("UnicodeUsernameValidator")
```

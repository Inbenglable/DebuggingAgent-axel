The issue arises from the change in behavior of how arrays are handled in assertions due to the commit mentioned. The specific part of the code responsible for checking `p.new in sentinels` causes a `ValueError` when `p.new` is an array, which is an unintended behavior due to the nature of NumPy arrays where such comparison returns an array of booleans.

The observed runtime error indicates an indentation issue in the test or reproduction script, which is unrelated to the core issue. However, resolving the core issue won't require focusing on this indentation error at the moment.

To identify the root cause related to the actual issue at hand, we should trace the logic within `_pytest/compat.py` where the faulty logic is located.

Observed method: `_pytest.compat:num_mock_patch_args`

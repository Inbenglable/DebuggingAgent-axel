## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Migration import ordering violates coding style and isort defaults
Description
	
New migration files are generated with imports sorted by module, independent of import style. For example:
import datetime
from django.db import migrations, models
import time
The ​Django coding style specifies:
Place all import module statements before from module import objects in each section.
This guidance is the same as what isort does by default, ​as documented here. Newly generated migrations can fail isort for this reason.
This would mean migration files should instead be generated like this:
import datetime
import time
from django.db import migrations, models
For reference, previous issues related to migration import sorting: #24155, #25384.

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue with the import ordering in migration files, I'll need to understand the part of Django's codebase responsible for generating these migration files. It's likely that this logic resides within the Django framework's migration handling code.

Firstly, I need to locate the migration generation logic in the Django codebase. A possible candidate is a method or class within Django's migration module that specifically deals with creating or generating these migrations.

I'll start by searching for relevant classes or methods within Django's migration-related files.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Migration")
search_class_in_codebase("MigrationWriter")
search_method_in_codebase("write_migration")
```

class Migration:
    """
    The base class for all migrations.

    Migration files will import this from django.db.migrations.Migration
    and subclass it as a class called Migration. It will have one or more
    of the following attributes:

     - operations: A list of Operation instances, probably from
       django.db.migrations.operations
     - dependencies: A list of tuples of (app_path, migration_name)
     - run_before: A list of tuples of (app_path, migration_name)
     - replaces: A list of migration_names

    Note that all migrations come out of migrations and into the Loader or
    Graph as instances, having been initialized with their app label and name.

==================================================

Your Output:
The classes `Migration` and `MigrationWriter` suggest that `MigrationWriter` is responsible for writing the migration files. To fix the import ordering issue, it's likely that I need to modify the logic in the `MigrationWriter` class, particularly the method that deals with the generation of migration files.

I'll need to examine the `MigrationWriter.as_string` method since it sounds like it could be responsible for converting the migration instance into a string representation that is then written to a file.

I’ll retrieve the source code for the `as_string` method located in `django/db/migrations/writer.py`.

search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/writer.py", "MigrationWriter.as_string")

Your Output:
Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

To address the issue, I need to examine the `_check_homomorphism` method and the related `_image` function within the specified file (`sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py`). This involves retrieving the source code for both the method and function to ensure I understand their current behavior and can make the necessary adjustments.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py", "_check_homomorphism")
search_code_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py", "def _image")
```

To generate a patch to fix the issue, I need to inspect the source code of the `Mul.flatten` method in the `sympy/core/mul.py` file. This method is responsible for handling expressions' multiplication, and adjustments are needed to ensure correct handling of operations involving `Poly`.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/core/mul.py", "flatten")
```

To address the issue, I need to retrieve the source code related to the `PyFunction.add_target_and_index` method found in `sphinx/domains/python.py`. This method appears to be responsible for adding index entries, which is relevant to the problem described. By examining this code, I can determine how to modify the index entry handling to prevent parentheses from being added inappropriately.

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/domains/python.py", "PyFunction.add_target_and_index")
```

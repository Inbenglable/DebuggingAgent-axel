Upon reviewing the observed behavior and tracing information, the error is indeed occurring because the `YearInSchool` enum is being mistakenly called by the Django Template Engine during the rendering process. The templates engine calls any context variable that is callable without any arguments, which is inappropriate for an enumeration type in this context.

To prevent this, we need to ensure that the Django's template engine does not attempt to call these enum members when rendering templates. Usually, this can be handled by modifying the Django template engine configuration or attributes of the class or enum, specifically setting `do_not_call_in_templates = True` for the enum's class.

Now, given the traceback you provided and the current location being the `Template.render` method, we must investigate further as the root cause might not be directly within this method but rather in how the template system handles callables in general.

To find the precise method or configuration to adjust, let's continue our exploration deeper into the template's evaluation aspects - specifically how templates handle variables and their callables. 

For now, I will trace deeper into the `_render` method of the `Template` class, as it carries out the main rendering logic and we might identify where callables like our enum are being improperly invoked.

Observed scope: `django/template/base.py:170-172`

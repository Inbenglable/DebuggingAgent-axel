To create a patch that fixes the `UnboundLocalError` in the `evalf` method, I need to review the source code of the `evalf` method within the `sympy/core/evalf.py` file. This will allow me to understand why the variables `reprec` and `imprec` are not being initialized under certain conditions and to ensure correct error handling or initialization.

I will now retrieve the source code of the `evalf` method from the `sympy/core/evalf.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/core/evalf.py", "evalf")
```

The patch addresses the problem of fitting `HuberRegressor` with boolean predictors by converting the boolean array `X` into a float array before proceeding with further operations. Specifically, a line is added to convert `X` using `np.asarray(X, dtype=float)`. This ensures that boolean inputs are properly transformed, thus preventing the `TypeError` previously encountered.

Let's analyze the test outputs before and after applying the patch:

### Original Output (Before Applying Patch)
The test fails with a `TypeError` indicating that usage of the `-` operator is invalid for numpy boolean arrays. This is consistent with the issue described, where boolean predictors led to errors during the execution of the algorithm.

### Patched Output (After Applying Patch)
The test passes successfully with the message "Issue is fixed." indicating that the `HuberRegressor` now handles boolean predictors correctly without raising an error. There is no Tracebacks or assertions failing in the patched output.

### Conclusion
The modification ensures that the boolean arrays are converted to float arrays before proceeding with the model fitting, thereby preventing the `TypeError` initially encountered. The change in the output post-patch confirms that the `HuberRegressor` correctly fits boolean arrays.

Issue resolved: `True`

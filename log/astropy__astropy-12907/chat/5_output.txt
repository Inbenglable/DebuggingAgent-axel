To address the issue with the `_cstack` function, it appears that the function does not correctly handle the separability of nested compound models, leading to an incorrect separability matrix. The goal is to adjust `_cstack` to correctly compute separability for nested compound models.

To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the combination logic correctly handles nested matrix structures, so that the separability matrix reflects the expected independence of components.

Here is the modification needed:

```python
### astropy/modeling/separable.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = 1
=======
cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = right
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the right matrix `cright` is filled with the appropriate `right` sub-matrix of its separability description, rather than filling it with 1s, which incorrectly suggests interdependencies.

After making this change, let's express the search/replace operation as indicated:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### astropy/modeling/separable.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ncright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = 1\n=======\ncright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = right\n>>>>>>> REPLACE"
  ]
}
``` 

By implementing this patch, the separability matrix should now correctly reflect the independent separability of nested compound models.

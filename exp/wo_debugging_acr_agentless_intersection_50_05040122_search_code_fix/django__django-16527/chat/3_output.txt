To determine whether the issue is fixed, let's break down the patch and test results:

### Patch Analysis:
1. **Original Code**:
   ```python
   "show_save_as_new": not is_popup
       and has_change_permission
       and change
       and save_as,
   ```
   The original code only checks for `has_change_permission`, `change`, and `save_as` when determining whether to show the "Save as new" option. It does not check for `has_add_permission`.

2. **Updated Code (Patched)**:
   ```python
   "show_save_as_new": not is_popup
       and has_add_permission  # This line was added
       and has_change_permission
       and change
       and save_as,
   ```
   The patched code now includes an additional check for `has_add_permission`. This ensures that the "Save as new" option is only shown if the user has both add and change permissions, addressing the issue raised.

### Test Output Analysis:
- **Original Output**:
  - "FAIL: 'Save as new' is shown even without add permission" indicates the original code was not hiding the "Save as new" button when the user lacked add permission, which is incorrect behavior as per the issue description.
  
- **Patched Output**:
  - All tests pass:
    - "PASS: 'Save as new' is correctly hidden when user lacks add permission" confirms the "Save as new" option is now hidden when the user doesn't have add permission, as desired.
    - Other tests verify the correct behavior when the required permissions are available and when the `save_as` feature is disabled.

Given the changes in the patch and the new test results, the test now passes in scenarios where it previously failed due to the missing permission check. Thus, the patch addresses the issue by correctly incorporating the `has_add_permission` check.

### Conclusion:
Issue resolved: `True`

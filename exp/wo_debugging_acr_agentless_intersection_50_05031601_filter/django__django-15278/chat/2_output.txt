Given the error message and the initial inspection of the `AddField` operation and `OneToOneField`, the problem seems to lie in how the `SchemaEditor` for SQLite handles the addition of fields with uniqueness constraints.

To proceed, I need to inspect the `add_field` method in the `SchemaEditor` class for SQLite, as this is crucial in understanding how migrations are being applied, especially with the additional `UNIQUE` constraint.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("SQLiteSchemaEditor.add_field")
search_class_in_file("django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py", "SQLiteSchemaEditor")
```

Based on my analysis, I need to retrieve the source code of the `CountVectorizer.__init__` method within the `sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py` file to understand how the initialization currently handles the `vocabulary` parameter and determine where the patch should be applied. 

I'll proceed to retrieve the source code using the search API.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py", "CountVectorizer.__init__")
```

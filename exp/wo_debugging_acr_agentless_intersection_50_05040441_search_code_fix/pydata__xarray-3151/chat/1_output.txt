In order to address the issue mentioned with the `xr.combine_by_coords` function in the xarray project, we need to review the implementation of this function to understand how it's handling non-monotonic coordinates. This can help us to determine the cause of the error and potentially how to modify the code to handle non-monotonic, identical coordinates without raising an error.

To proceed, I need to locate the source code for the `combine_by_coords` function in the xarray project.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("combine_by_coords")
```

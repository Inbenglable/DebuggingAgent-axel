Here's the patch to resolve the issue with the `caplog` fixture not restoring log levels after a test:

}
``` 

This patch ensures that both logger and handler levels are restored to their original states after each test by incorporating the storage and restoration of the original handler level into the `set_level` and `_finalize` methods, respectively.

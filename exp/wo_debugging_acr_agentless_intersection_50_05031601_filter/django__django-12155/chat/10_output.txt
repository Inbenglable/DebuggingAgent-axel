Let's review the process:

### Patch Review
The patch modifies the code in `django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py` by changing the logic for determining the indentation in order to skip the first line of the docstring when calculating the minimum indentation:

- **Original code:**
  ```python
  indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())
  ```

- **Patched code:**
  ```python
  indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())
  ```

The patch correctly adjusts the code to skip the first line, matching the suggestion provided in the issue description. This is intended to resolve the problem with indentation when the first line of a docstring is not empty.

### Test Output Analysis
#### Original Output
The error was an `ImportError` indicating that `simplify_exception` could not be imported from `django.contrib.admindocs.views`.

#### Patched Output
The output after the patch remains the same:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-12155/reproduce.py", line 4, in <module>
    from django.contrib.admindocs.views import simplify_exception
ImportError: cannot import name 'simplify_exception'
```

### Conclusion
The ImportError is unrelated to the issue being addressed. It seems there is a problem in locating or defining `simplify_exception`, which is a separate matter from the docstring trimming logic. This means the test cannot properly execute to check the patch's effectiveness.

Given that the output before and after the patch is identical and does not confirm the successful processing of the example docstring:

Issue resolved: `False`

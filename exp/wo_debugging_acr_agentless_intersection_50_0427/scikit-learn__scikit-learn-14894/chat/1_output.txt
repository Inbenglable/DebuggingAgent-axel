Based on the error message provided, the issue is occurring in the `_sparse_fit` method located at `/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/sklearn/svm/base.py`. To address this issue, I need to examine the source code of this method to implement a solution that checks for cases where `dual_coef_indices.size` or `n_class` might be zero, which would cause a division by zero error.

Therefore, I will use the `search_method_in_file` API to retrieve the source code for the `_sparse_fit` method in the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/svm/base.py", "_sparse_fit")
```

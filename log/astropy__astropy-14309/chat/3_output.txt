In the method `_UnifiedIORegistryBase.identify_format` located at `astropy/io/registry/base.py`, the `if` statement at line 313 calls `self._identifiers[(data_format, data_class)]`, which appears to trigger the `IndexError` due to an issue in handling the arguments provided. 

To further diagnose the issue and possibly locate the buggy method, we need to delve into the specific identifier function being executed that leads to the error. Thus, examining the handler function within `astropy/io/fits/connect.py` that initiates the `args[0]` operation will be more insightful. 

Let's trace the line at the point of the error to understand how arguments are processed and why `IndexError` occurs, particularly in:

Observed scope: `astropy/io/fits/connect.py:72-72`

To resolve the issue, I need to inspect the `CythonCodeWrapper` class, which is likely responsible for handling the Cython-specific code generation logic used in autowrap. This class is used within the `autowrap` function to handle code wrapping when the `cython` backend is specified. Therefore, I will need to gather the source code for the `CythonCodeWrapper` class and examine how it deals with the argument types and function signatures.

I'll search for the `CythonCodeWrapper` class in the SymPy codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("CythonCodeWrapper")
```

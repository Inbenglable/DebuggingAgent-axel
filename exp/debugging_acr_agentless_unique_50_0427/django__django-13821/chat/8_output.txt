To generate the appropriate patch, I need to review the source code of the `check_sqlite_version` method within the `reproduce.py` file. This will allow me to apply the necessary modifications for accurately checking the SQLite version used by Django.

I will proceed to search for the `check_sqlite_version` method in the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("reproduce.py", "check_sqlite_version")
```

To begin resolving the issue with the `separability_matrix` and nested `CompoundModels`, we'll create a minimal debugging test. This test will help us isolate the problem specifically related to the incorrect computation of the separability matrix for nested compound models. Here's the JSON representation of the debugging test:

```json
{
    "debugging_test": "from astropy.modeling import models as m\nfrom astropy.modeling.separable import separability_matrix\n\n# Nested compound model test\ncm = m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)\nnested_model = m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm\n\nprint('Debugging Test: Nested Compound Model')\nprint(separability_matrix(nested_model))"
}
```

**Explanation:**
- This test focuses on the problematic scenario described in the issue: a nested compound model.
- We use `m.Pix2Sky_TAN()` and `cm` as nested components to mimic the described bug.
- The test will print out the computed separability matrix for the nested model, specifically focusing on verifying if it misbehaves as per the initial issue report.

The above code will serve as the basis to monitor the runtime behavior and further dissect the issue in steps II and III.

To create the patch, I'll need to review the source code of the `_sparse_fit` method within the `BaseLibSVM` class in the sklearn project. This will allow me to analyze the code and determine how to add the needed conditional checks to handle the division by zero issue. I will proceed to retrieve the source code.

```python
search_class_in_file("sklearn/svm/base.py", "BaseLibSVM")
search_method_in_file("sklearn/svm/base.py", "_sparse_fit")
```

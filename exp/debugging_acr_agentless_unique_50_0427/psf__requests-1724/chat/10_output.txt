The source code for the `PreparedRequest.prepare_method` is already obtained:

```python
def prepare_method(self, method):
    """Prepares the given HTTP method."""
    self.method = method
    if self.method is not None:
        self.method = self.method.upper()
```

This function presently accepts a method, assigns it to `self.method`, and converts it to uppercase if it is not `None`. The issue in Python 2.7 involves the Unicode method names causing `UnicodeDecodeError` when mingling with ASCII operations.

A possible fix is to ensure the method string is always converted to a byte string during preparation, which avoids potential Unicode-related issues in Python 2.7. The updated `prepare_method` can explicitly encode the method as an ASCII string before processing.

Ready generation: `True`

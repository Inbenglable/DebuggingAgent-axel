To address the issue and prepare for generating the patch, I currently have the source code for the `_cstack` method where the problem originates. From the analysis, this method incorrectly manages the independence of outputs and inputs across nested compound models.

Since I have enough information to generate the patch, there's no need to retrieve additional source code. I will proceed with patch generation.

Ready generation: `True`

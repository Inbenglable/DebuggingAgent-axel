To address the issue, I need to examine how the `as_sql` method is implemented in both `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` classes. These methods are crucial because they are likely responsible for handling the conversion and considering the `tzinfo` parameter. Here's how I will obtain the necessary code:

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncDate.as_sql")
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncTime.as_sql")
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncBase.as_sql")
```

I also included `TruncBase.as_sql` since `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` inherit from `TruncBase`, and this might contain relevant logic.

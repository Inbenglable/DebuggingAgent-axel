To address the issue regarding the `Field.__hash__()` method's mutability, I should first locate the `Field` class and its `__hash__` method in the Django codebase. This will allow me to examine the current implementation and understand what changes might be necessary to ensure the hash value remains immutable even after the field is assigned to a model class.

I will retrieve the source code of the `Field.__hash__` method.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("Field.__hash__")
```

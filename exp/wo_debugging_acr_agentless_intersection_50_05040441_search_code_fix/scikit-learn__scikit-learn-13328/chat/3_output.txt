Based on the provided information, we'll address the issue of handling boolean arrays in the `HuberRegressor.fit` method. Specifically, we'll add code to convert the input `X` from boolean to float if necessary before proceeding with the rest of the method's operations.

Here's how we'll patch the code:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sklearn/linear_model/huber.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        X, y = check_X_y(\n=======\n        # Convert boolean X to float\n        if X.dtype == bool:\n            X = X.astype(float)\n        X, y = check_X_y(\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch checks if the `dtype` of `X` is boolean and, if so, converts it to a float type before proceeding with the rest of the `fit` method. This ensures compatibility similar to other linear models like `LinearRegression` that handle different input types gracefully.

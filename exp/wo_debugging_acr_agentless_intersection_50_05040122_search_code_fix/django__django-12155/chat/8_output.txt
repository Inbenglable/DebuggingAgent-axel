### Patch Review

The proposed patch makes a change to the `trim_docstring` function in `django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py` by modifying the list comprehension used to compute the indentation level. The modification changes the code from:

```python
indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())
```

to:

```python
indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())
```

By adjusting the range from `lines` to `lines[1:]`, the patch aims to skip the first line when calculating indentation, addressing the issue with docstrings that have content on the first line as reported.

### Test Output Analysis

#### Original Output
The test fails to run due to an `ImportError` while trying to import `simplify_exception`. This error implies that the test setup is incorrect or outdated, as it references a module or function that does not exist or is inaccessible in the current context.

#### Patched Output
After applying the patch, the same `ImportError` persists, indicating that the underlying issue with the test setup remains unchanged. The error prevents the test from executing the logic that checks for the original bug related to docstring processing.

### Conclusion

The import error is unrelated to the core issue with docstring handling, and since the test code does not actually validate the functionality related to docstring processing due to this import failure, we cannot determine if the issue has been resolved.

Hence, based on the provided test output before and after the patch, we cannot conclude whether the issue with docstring processing has been resolved because the testing context itself is failing due to an unrelated error.

Issue resolved: `False`

To address the issue, I need to inspect the existing implementation of the `trim_docstring` function or method responsible for handling the indentation of docstrings. The problem lies in how the indentation level is calculated, especially with the first line of the docstring. Therefore, I need to locate the source of the `trim_docstring` implementation to generate the patch.

I'll begin by searching for the `trim_docstring` method in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("trim_docstring")
```

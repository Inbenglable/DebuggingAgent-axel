To determine whether the issue is resolved, we need to evaluate both the provided patch and the outputs before and after the patch is applied:

### Patch Review

The patch proposes two primary changes:
1. **Sorted Seeds for Consistency:** The seeds generated for different initializations are sorted. This means that the order of seeds does not vary between runs, potentially contributing to more consistent outputs.
2. **Pre-dispatch of Jobs:** Setting `pre_dispatch=n_init` ensures uniform dispatching of jobs when parallel execution is used, which could help in reducing variability caused by non-uniform dispatch behavior.

### Test Output Analysis

**Original Output:**
- The assertion test failed because the inertia values for `n_jobs=1` and `n_jobs=2` were different (`17815.004991244623` for `n_jobs=1` and `17815.060435554242` for `n_jobs=2`).

**Patched Output:**
- After applying the patch, the output remains unchanged, indicating that the inertia values are still different for `n_jobs=1` and `n_jobs=2` (`17815.004991244623` for `n_jobs=1` and `17815.060435554242` for `n_jobs=2`).

### Conclusion

Since the test output did not change after applying the patch, and the inertia values remain inconsistent for `n_jobs=1` and `n_jobs=2`, it indicates that the patch did not resolve the issue. The inertia values should match to confirm consistent behavior regardless of the `n_jobs` setting.

Issue resolved: `False`

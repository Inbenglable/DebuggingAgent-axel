To resolve the issue where the `ModelChoiceField` does not provide the value of the invalid choice when raising a `ValidationError`, I need to modify the error message format or the portion of code where the error is raised to include the invalid choice value.

Before generating the patch, I need to retrieve the source code for the `ModelChoiceField` class to understand where and how the `ValidationError` is being raised and what modifications would be necessary.

Given that I need the source code for `ModelChoiceField`, I will search for this class in the codebase for Django.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ModelChoiceField")
```

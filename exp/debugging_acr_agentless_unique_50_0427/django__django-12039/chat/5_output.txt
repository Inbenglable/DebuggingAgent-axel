The observed issue and traceback information highlight a problem in the SQL generation for CREATE INDEX statements, particularly with the `Columns` class in the `ddl_references.py` file. The issue is related to how column suffixes are appended directly to quoted column names, potentially without necessary spacing.

In the observed `Columns.__str__` method, the code:

```python
return self.quote_name(column) + self.col_suffixes[idx]
```

does not handle spacing between `column` and `col_suffixes[idx]`, which can lead to improper SQL syntax, like "`name` DESC" being output as "`name`DESC" and "`name` text_pattern_ops" being output with incorrect spacing.

Currently, based on the analysis:

1. The issue is apparent in the `Columns.__str__` method.
2. The incorrect concatenation without handling spaces could be the root cause of the bug.

At this point, I can locate the buggy method that needs a fix to ensure proper whitespace handling.

Buggy method: `django/db/backends/ddl_references.py:Columns.__str__`

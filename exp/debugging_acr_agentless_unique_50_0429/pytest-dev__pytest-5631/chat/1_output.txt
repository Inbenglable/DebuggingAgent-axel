The error received suggests that there is an indentation error on line 1 of the test script `reproduce.py`. In Python, indentation is significant and must be consistent for code blocks.

Looking at the error in the issue report, the root cause of the value error seems to be within the logic that checks if `p.new` is in `sentinels`. The list comprehension is not correctly handling the NumPy array, resulting in a truth value ambiguity. The problematic section of code that needs adjustment is:

```python
if not p.attribute_name and p.new in sentinels
```

Given the error message, the likely file involved in this check is `_pytest/compat.py`, particularly the `num_mock_patch_args` function.

To resolve the issue, we must trace the method where this code piece is executed to understand the logic and implementation.
Therefore, I will continue by observing the indicated function within the mentioned file.

Observed method: `_pytest/compat.py:num_mock_patch_args`

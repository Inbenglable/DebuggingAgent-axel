The observed code snippet in `astropy/io/fits/connect.py` at line 72:

```python
return isinstance(args[0], (HDUList, TableHDU, BinTableHDU, GroupsHDU))
```

is triggering an `IndexError` because it attempts to access the first element of the `args` tuple, which is empty. This indicates that the `args` tuple is not correctly populated before being used in this `isinstance` call.

The root cause of the `IndexError` seems to lie in how `args` is constructed or passed to this function. Since the function assumes `args[0]` is present without validation, it suggests an upstream issue in the argument passing logic for this identifier function.

Given this understanding, it's probable that the root cause is located in the registration or invocation of the identifier function. This leads me to consider that the problem might be in how the `is_fits` function is expected to be used or how the arguments are passed to it.

Therefore, we should review the context of how `is_fits` is called during the format identification process.

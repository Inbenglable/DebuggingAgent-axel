To address the issue, the `prepare_headers` method in `requests/models.py` needs to be modified to handle `None` values properly in the headers dictionary. I need to retrieve the source code for this method to generate a precise patch.

I'll proceed to retrieve the source code of the `prepare_headers` method in the specified file:

```python
search_method_in_file("requests/models.py", "PreparedRequest.prepare_headers")
```

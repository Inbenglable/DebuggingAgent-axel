Based on the logic of the `DimensionSystem.is_dimensionless` method, it correctly identifies dimensionless quantities by checking for an empty dimensional dependency or a name equivalent to 1. However, in the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method, the handling of `Function` expressions doesn't seem to take dimensionless exponent evaluation into account effectively.

To address the issue, I need to update the handling of the `Function` cases in `_collect_factor_and_dimension` to properly check for dimensionless arguments and return dimensionless properties if required.

I already have the source code for the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` inner workings, and the logic behind dimension validation, represented by `DimensionSystem.is_dimensionless`, which assists in understanding dimensionless evaluation.

Therefore, I have sufficient information to proceed with generating a patch for the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method.

Ready generation: `True`

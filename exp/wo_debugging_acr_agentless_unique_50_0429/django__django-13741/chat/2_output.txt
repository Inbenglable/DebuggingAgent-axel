To resolve the issue, I need to make modifications in the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` class which is located in `django/contrib/auth/forms.py`. Specifically, I need to set the `disabled` attribute to `True`. I also need to examine the `__init__` method of the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` class to see how to best incorporate this change.

Let's retrieve the full source code for the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` class to see its current initializer method and make the necessary modifications.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/contrib/auth/forms.py", "ReadOnlyPasswordHashField")
```

To address the issue with the migration optimizer and `AlterField`, I need to examine the `reduce` method of the `AlterField` class, as this is likely where the optimization logic resides. As I have the file path for the `AlterField` class, I will search for the `reduce` method within this file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py", "AlterField.reduce")
```

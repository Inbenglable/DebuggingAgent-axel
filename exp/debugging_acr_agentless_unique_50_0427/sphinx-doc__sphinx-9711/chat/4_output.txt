The issue here arises from how version checks are executed as string comparisons rather than semantic version comparisons. Consequently, any version greater than 9 (for example, '0.10.0') would be considered smaller than '0.6.0' if compared as strings, causing incorrect assertions to fail as seen in the error traceback.

In the provided script, the version check is performed within the function `check_extension_version`. This is where a string comparison occurs:

```python
if required_version > actual_version:
    raise AssertionError(...)
```

To resolve this, we need to make sure version strings are compared numerically according to semantic versioning. Generally, this can be accomplished through utilities like `packaging.version` in Python.

Since the error points directly to this line as the root cause, we likely need to modify the `check_extension_version` method to perform proper semantic version comparison.

Therefore, the buggy method is:

Buggy method: `reproduce.py:check_extension_version`

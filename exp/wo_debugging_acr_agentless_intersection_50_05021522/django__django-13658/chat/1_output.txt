To generate the patch, I need to review the source code of the `ManagementUtility` class to understand its current implementation better. I specifically need to see how `CommandParser` is being instantiated and how `self.prog_name` is being handled. Therefore, I will search for the `ManagementUtility` class and its methods in the codebase.

I'll start by looking for the `ManagementUtility` class in the codebase, as I do not have the specific file path where it is defined.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ManagementUtility")
```

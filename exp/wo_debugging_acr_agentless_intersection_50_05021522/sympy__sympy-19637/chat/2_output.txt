The issue lies in the fact that the local variable `kern` is not initialized before it's referenced in the statement `hit = kern in s`. To resolve this, `kern` should be initialized before that line. I now have enough code to generate a patch for this issue by adding an initial assignment for `kern`.

Ready generation: `True`

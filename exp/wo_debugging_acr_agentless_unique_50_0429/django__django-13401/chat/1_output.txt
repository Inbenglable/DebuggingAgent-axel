To fix the issue, I need to analyze the logic related to equality between model fields, specifically the `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods of the field class. Since field comparison is mentioned in the context, I need to look at the implementation of these methods in the Django field class. 

Given that this issue is related to how fields are compared in Django's model system, the likely class involved is `Field`, which resides in Django's ORM system. I'll start by searching for the `Field` class and its `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Field")
search_method_in_codebase("Field.__eq__")
search_method_in_codebase("Field.__hash__")
search_method_in_codebase("Field.__lt__")
```

To address the issue, I need to review the implementation of the `subs` method in the `Piecewise` class, as it is directly involved in substitution operations and might be the source of the `PolynomialError`. This will help us understand how substitutions are managed in expressions with assumptions.

I'll retrieve the relevant method's source code to examine its behavior and identify where the error might be arising.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py", "Piecewise._eval_subs")
```

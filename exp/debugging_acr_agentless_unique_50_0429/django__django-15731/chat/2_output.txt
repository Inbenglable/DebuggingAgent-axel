Looking at the current information, the issue arises from the `setup_django` function not being called before the definition of the `Person` model class. This is important because the Django settings need to be initialized before any model is defined. The error message clearly shows that the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting has not been configured at the time of accessing the model during module loading.

To address this issue in the test setup:

1. Call `setup_django` before defining any models or importing any modules that depend on settings.

2. Ensure that `setup_django` initializes settings early in the script execution to prevent any `ImproperlyConfigured` exceptions.

Given that the runtime error relates directly to the order of operations in setting up Django settings and defining models, the program behavior needs to be adjusted in script ordering:

Let's investigate further into how `setup_django()` sets up the environment by observing its execution closer up to the point where it sets the environment variable and configures Django settings.

Observed scope: `reproduce.py:19-35`

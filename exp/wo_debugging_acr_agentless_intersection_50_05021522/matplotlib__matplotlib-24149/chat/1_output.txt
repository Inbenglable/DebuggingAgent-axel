To address the issue with `ax.bar` when handling all NaN data in Matplotlib 3.6.1, I need to investigate the source code of the `Axes.bar` method. This involves understanding how the method currently manages NaN values and determining the changes that led to this behavior.

I will first search for the `Axes.bar` method definition within the project codebase, as it is the primary method involved in the error.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("Axes.bar")
```

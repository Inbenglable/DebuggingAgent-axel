To resolve the issue with the import ordering in migration files, I'll need to understand the part of Django's codebase responsible for generating these migration files. It's likely that this logic resides within the Django framework's migration handling code.

Firstly, I need to locate the migration generation logic in the Django codebase. A possible candidate is a method or class within Django's migration module that specifically deals with creating or generating these migrations.

I'll start by searching for relevant classes or methods within Django's migration-related files.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Migration")
search_class_in_codebase("MigrationWriter")
search_method_in_codebase("write_migration")
```

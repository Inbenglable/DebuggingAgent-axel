To address the issue, I need to modify the `Dataset.merge` method to handle the situation where it is called with a `DataArray`. Since `DataArray` is not directly compatible with the expected input type `CoercibleMapping`, I'll need to review the source code for how a `DataArray` is handled when using the top-level `merge` function and then adapt this logic into `Dataset.merge`.

I will search for the `merge` function's implementation in order to understand how it handles the merging of `DataArray` with a `Dataset`. 

```python
search_method_in_codebase("merge")
```

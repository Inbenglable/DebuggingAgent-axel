Let's review the patch and analyze the test outputs before and after the patch.

### Patch Review

The modification made in the patch is in the `astropy/table/table.py` file. Specifically, the line that transforms structured numpy arrays into `NdarrayMixin` has been replaced with a warning that informs users about the upcoming removal of this behavior in Astropy version 5.2. The patch modifies the behavior by setting `data_is_mixin` to `False`.

#### Key Changes

1. **Adding a Warning**: The patch introduces a `FutureWarning` that informs the user about the eventual deprecation of automatic conversion of structured numpy arrays into `NdarrayMixin`.

2. **Behavior Modification**: The variable `data_is_mixin`, which previously checked if the data was viewed as a mixin, is set to `False`.

### Test Output Analysis

#### Original Output

Before applying the patch, running the test results in an `AssertionError`, indicating that the structured array is transformed into `NdarrayMixin`, which is the issue raised.

#### Patched Output

After applying the patch, the output indicates that the issue is fixed, as the structured array is not transformed into `NdarrayMixin`. 

### Conclusion

The patch has successfully changed the behavior so that structured arrays are no longer automatically transformed into `NdarrayMixin`, and it also informs users of the upcoming changes via a `FutureWarning`. Given the test results and the patch implementation:

Issue resolved: `True`

The issue originates from a `KeyError` caused by the custom `ForeignKey` that deletes its 'to' value during the deconstruction process. The error occurs in the `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` file when the autodetector tries to access the missing 'to' key. 

The current traceback indicates an `ImproperlyConfigured` error relating to the Django settings, preventing the test from running correctly. This issue is separate from the original `KeyError`.

Inside the `MigrationAutodetector.generate_renamed_models` method, the autodetector is accessing the deconstructed field representations, which likely triggers the error due to the missing 'to' key removed by the custom ForeignKey's `deconstruct` method.

To identify the buggy method related to the original issue, we can infer that the `MigrationAutodetector.only_relation_agnostic_fields` method contains logic that expects the 'to' key, since the stack trace points us to this area, specifically line 99.

Therefore, the original `KeyError` due to the deletion of the 'to' key in the custom ForeignKeyâ€™s `deconstruct` method seems to manifest in:

Buggy method: `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py:MigrationAutodetector.only_relation_agnostic_fields`

To generate the patch, I need to obtain the source code of the `get_object_members` method from the `ModuleDocumenter` class within the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file to apply the necessary fix for the described issue.

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py", "ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members")
```

The issue in the `sympy` project revolves around the method `UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension` not properly handling dimensionless exponents in expressions. After reviewing the current implementation of the method, it appears that the handling of functions within the `Function` clause of the method could be problematic, especially for functions like `exp` which inherently expect a dimensionless input.

To address the issue:
1. The function is currently unpacking the `expr.args` into factors and dimensions and reconstructing the function using only the factors. The dimensions from arguments are not being verified to ensure they are dimensionless. This causes the function like `exp` to fail when it encounters non-dimensionless input.
2. Specifically, in the `Function` clause, the handling of dimensionless checks should be enhanced.

Given that we have all necessary information about the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method, we are ready to propose a patch to fix this issue.

Ready generation: `True`

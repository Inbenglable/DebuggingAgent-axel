I need to retrieve the source code for the `add_fields` method in the `django/forms/formsets.py` file to understand its functionality and generate the patch. This method seems to belong to a class, but the class name wasn't specified in the issue. To proceed, I'll first search for this method in its specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/forms/formsets.py", "add_fields")
```

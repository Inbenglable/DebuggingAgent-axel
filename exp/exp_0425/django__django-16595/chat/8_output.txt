I have obtained the source code for both the `AlterField.reduce` method and the `is_same_field_operation` method. The `reduce` method needs to be updated to handle cases where multiple `AlterField` operations occur for the same field. 

I have enough context and source code to proceed with generating the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

To address the issue, I need to examine the source code of the `ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute()` method and assess how it interacts with the `FileInput` in Django's `forms/widgets.py`. I will move this logic to `FileInput.use_required_attribute()` as suggested if no specific use cases requiring its current position are identified. 

Here's the plan:
1. Retrieve the `ClearableFileInput` class code to understand the context.
2. Locate the `use_required_attribute` method within this class.
3. Investigate the `FileInput` class to ascertain where this logic can be moved.

Let's start by fetching the respective source codes:

```python
search_class_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "ClearableFileInput")
search_method_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute")
search_class_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "FileInput")
search_method_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "FileInput.use_required_attribute")
```

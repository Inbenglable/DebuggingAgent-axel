To resolve the issue mentioned, I need to understand how the DISTINCT support is currently implemented in Django aggregates, particularly for Avg and Sum, and whether any related changes are needed in the codebase. This usually involves looking into the `django.db.models.aggregates` module where these aggregate functions are defined.

Before proceeding to generate the patch, I need to inspect the existing implementation of Avg, Sum, Min, and Max aggregates in the codebase. Specifically, I will look for the required classes and methods that handle these aggregates.

Let's search for the class definitions of these aggregates to understand how to allow DISTINCT for them:

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Avg")
search_class_in_codebase("Sum")
search_class_in_codebase("Min")
search_class_in_codebase("Max")
```

Once I have the class definitions, I will be able to determine the changes needed to add DISTINCT support for Avg, Sum, Min, and Max aggregates.

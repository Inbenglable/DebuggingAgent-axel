We have discovered that the `caplog` fixture code initializes a `LogCaptureFixture` instance and calls its `_finalize` method at the end of the test to presumably restore the original log levels or to perform cleanup operations.

To confirm this and understand how the log level restoration should be implemented, we need to examine the `LogCaptureFixture` class and its methods, especially `_finalize`.

Let's search for the `LogCaptureFixture` class in the file `src/_pytest/logging.py` to understand its implementation and locate the `_finalize` method.

```python
search_class_in_file("src/_pytest/logging.py", "LogCaptureFixture")
search_method_in_file("src/_pytest/logging.py", "LogCaptureFixture._finalize")
```

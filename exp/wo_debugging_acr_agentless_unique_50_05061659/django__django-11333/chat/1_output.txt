To address the issue, I need to retrieve the source code for the `get_resolver` method, as it's crucial for generating the patch. The problem involves modifying how `get_resolver` constructs a `URLResolver`, so understanding its existing implementation is essential.

Additionally, I need to look into any related settings or functions that might influence the construction and memoization process in `get_resolver`. Specifically, I will look for `get_urlconf` and inspect the `URLResolver` class, particularly the `_populate` method, to understand the costly operations.

Here is the approach to search for the necessary source code:

```python
search_method_in_codebase("get_resolver")
search_method_in_codebase("get_urlconf")
search_class_in_codebase("URLResolver")
search_method_in_codebase("URLResolver._populate")
```

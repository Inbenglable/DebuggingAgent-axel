To determine whether the issue is resolved, let's first review the changes made in the patch and analyze the output from the test both before and after applying the patch.

### Patch Review:
The patch modifies the `_TR56` method in the `fu.py` file. The changes are:

1. Initially, the code checked if the expression's exponent (`rv.exp`) is less than zero or greater than the maximum without checking if `rv.exp` is a number. This would be problematic when dealing with complex numbers.

2. After the patch, the code now includes a check to see if `rv.exp.is_number` is `True` before performing the comparison. This ensures that comparisons are only executed for numerical values, avoiding invalid operations on complex numbers.

### Test Analysis:

#### Original Output:
The original output indicates a `NameError: name 'I' is not defined`. This error suggests that the test code is unable to recognize the complex unit `I`, which is likely a missing import. The subsequent `AssertionError` confirms that the bug issue is present.

#### Patched Output:
The patched output mirrors the original output, resulting in an identical `NameError`. Consequently, the same `AssertionError` is raised, indicating the issue is still present.

### Conclusion:
Despite modifying the checks in the `_TR56` method, the test fails due to a `NameError`, unrelated to the actual comparison logic. Therefore, the change does not resolve the issue as the test doesn't run successfully. The import problem needs to be addressed by adding `from sympy import I` to the test to ensure it correctly evaluates whether the patch works.

Issue resolved: `False`

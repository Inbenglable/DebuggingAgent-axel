### Analysis of the Current Observed Code and Abnormal Program Behavior:

The `call_command()` function in Django is responsible for invoking management commands. The snippet being observed is crucial because it shows part of the logic that tries to parse command-line arguments.

### Observations:

1. **Snippet Insight:**
   - The code attempts to gather required arguments to pass them to `parse_args()`.
   - It checks if any required options are in `options` and adds them to `parse_args`.

2. **Current Error:** 
   - We witness an error simply because the `'command'` is not registered. The snippet above is not executed in this scenario because it hasn't reached that part yetâ€”the surrounding code prematurely raises an error about the command not being found.

3. **Mutually Exclusive Groups:**
   - The snippet suggests that the current implementation checks for required arguments but doesn't necessarily consider groups of arguments that are mutually exclusive. Both arguments could be part of a mutually exclusive group marked '`required=True`', but the snippet only checks individual required arguments.

### Deduction:

To solve the main issue, there are two tasks essentially:
- **Registering Command:** The command registration issue is fundamental before diving into any argument parsing, since without a registered command, the parsing logic won't ever execute.
- **Handling Required Groups:** Once the command is properly registered, this observation indicates the need for handling mutually exclusive groups correctly within the parsing logic.

### Immediate Required Action:

Fix the registration of the command first so the argument parsing logic can be reached during execution, ensuring mutually exclusive argument parsing based on the initial description of the issue.

### Next Tracing Step:

We need to explore further into `call_command` to understand how the arguments parsing is handled concerning mutually exclusive groups once we resolve registration. Let's focus next on whether there is existing logic for mutually exclusive groups within or related to `call_command`.

You need to trace the abnormal program to resolve project issues and submit pull requests.
Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **scikit-learn** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Expose warm_start in Isolation forest
It seems to me that `sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest` supports incremental addition of new trees with the `warm_start` parameter of its parent class, `sklearn.ensemble.BaseBagging`.

Even though this parameter is not exposed in `__init__()` , it gets inherited from `BaseBagging` and one can use it by changing it to `True` after initialization. To make it work, you have to also increment `n_estimators` on every iteration. 

It took me a while to notice that it actually works, and I had to inspect the source code of both `IsolationForest` and `BaseBagging`. Also, it looks to me that the behavior is in-line with `sklearn.ensemble.BaseForest` that is behind e.g. `sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`.

To make it more easier to use, I'd suggest to:
* expose `warm_start` in `IsolationForest.__init__()`, default `False`;
* document it in the same way as it is documented for `RandomForestClassifier`, i.e. say:
```py
    warm_start : bool, optional (default=False)
        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit
        and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole
        new forest. See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.
```
* add a test to make sure it works properly;
* possibly also mention in the "IsolationForest example" documentation entry;

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("IsolationForest does not support warm_start as expected.")

    # If no exception is raised, the issue might be fixed

This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
Based on the provided log, the issue arises because the `warm_start` parameter is not exposed in the `IsolationForest` class, resulting in a `ValueError` when attempting to set it via `set_params`. 

From the traceback, the `ValueError` is triggered in the `set_params` method because `warm_start` is not listed in the valid parameters for the `IsolationForest` estimator.

To locate the source of this problem, I need to investigate the constructor of `IsolationForest` to determine how parameters are defined and which are exposed.

Observed method: `sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py:IsolationForest.__init__`
==================================================
The observed `IsolationForest.__init__` method does not currently expose the `warm_start` parameter. The issue arises when the user tries to set `warm_start` via `set_params`, which fails because `warm_start` is not part of the valid parameter list for `IsolationForest`.

Since the superclass `BaseBagging` already supports `warm_start`, the solution is to explicitly include it in the `IsolationForest` constructor parameters.

Before confirming the buggy method or code, I will observe how parameters are passed to the parent class and if there might be any other influential parameters involved in the `super().__init__()` call.

Observed scope: `sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py:177-190`
==================================================


Now you choose IsolationForest.__init__'s code snippet 
   177	        super().__init__(
   178	            base_estimator=ExtraTreeRegressor(
   179	                max_features=1,
   180	                splitter='random',
   181	                random_state=random_state),
   182	            # here above max_features has no links with self.max_features
   183	            bootstrap=bootstrap,
   184	            bootstrap_features=False,
   185	            n_estimators=n_estimators,
   186	            max_samples=max_samples,
   187	            max_features=max_features,
   188	            n_jobs=n_jobs,
   189	            random_state=random_state,
   190	            verbose=verbose)

for further observation, tracing the abnormal program behavior.

This is the runtime information of the code snippet you choose to observed in IsolationForest.__init__:

You need to trace the abnormal program behavior step by step to identify the root cause of the bug and locate the buggy method that contains the code to be fixed.
Now, please first analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior. 

Then, if you can already locate the buggy method and buggy code, reply with:  
Buggy method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Otherwise, continue tracing by selecting the next method to observe. Reply with: 
Observed method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Note that {FILE_PATH} refers to the path relative to the repository. And if you want to observe a method inside a class, please specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME.

To determine whether the issue is resolved, let's analyze the provided patch, test outputs, and context.

### Patch Analysis

The patch modifies the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass to ensure that docstrings are inherited for properties as well as methods. It replaces the line checking for `inspect.isfunction(val)` with a combined check for either `inspect.isfunction(val)` or `inspect.isdatadescriptor(val)`. The use of `inspect.isdatadescriptor` is appropriate for properties, which are data descriptors in Python.

### Original Output Analysis

Before the patch was applied, the original test output showed an `AssertionError` for the property docstring not being inherited, as indicated by:
```
AssertionError: Property docstring not inherited.
```

### Patched Output Analysis

After the patch was applied, the output of the test is empty:
```

```
An empty output typically indicates that the assertions in the test passed without triggering any exceptions, which means both the method and property docstrings are inherited as expected.

### Conclusion

Since the `AssertionError` related to the property docstring not being inherited is absent in the patched output, we can conclude that with the patch, the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass is now correctly handling properties. 

Therefore, the issue is resolved.

Issue resolved: `True`

To resolve the issue, I need to examine the current implementation of the `load_disk` method in the `MigrationLoader` class within the `django/db/migrations/loader.py` file. I will retrieve the source code of this method to understand how it currently checks for namespace packages and prepare to modify it accordingly.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/loader.py", "MigrationLoader.load_disk")
```

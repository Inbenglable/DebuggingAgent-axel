To analyze the abnormal program behavior, we need to understand the error: `django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet.` This indicates that the Django application's app registry is not ready when the model is being defined. This error typically arises because the Django app configuration has not been initialized properly before accessing models. 

In Django, models are usually defined after configuring the app and running the setup process, which includes migration and initializing the app registry. In this test script, the settings are configured manually, but it appears the app registry is not initialized properly before defining the model, which leads to the error.

The issue arises during the initialization of `TestModel`, specifically when trying to access or register models before the app registry is ready. This is indicated in the traceback showing the error occurs at `django/db/models/base.py:108`.

To resolve the configuration issue, we should ensure the Django apps are initialized before accessing any models. In typical usage, this is done automatically by Djangoâ€™s management commands (like `migrate`). However, in this case, the manual configuration of settings might need an explicit call to set up the apps.

Next step would be to trace why the app registry isn't ready by selecting methods involved in app setup and model initialization.

Observed method: `django/db/models/base.py:ModelBase.__new__`

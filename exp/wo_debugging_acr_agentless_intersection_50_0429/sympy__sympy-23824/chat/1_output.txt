To resolve the issue, I need to locate the `kahane_simplify()` method within the SymPy codebase to analyze how the leading gamma matrices are being manipulated. Assuming I don't have direct access to the file path, I would need to use the search API to locate the method within the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("kahane_simplify")
```

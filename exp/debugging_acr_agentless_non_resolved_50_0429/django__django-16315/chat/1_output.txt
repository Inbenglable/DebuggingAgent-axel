To resolve the reported bug, we need to trace the abnormal behavior observed during the execution of `qs.bulk_create(instances, update_conflicts=True, update_fields=["sectorid"], unique_fields=["blacklistid"])`. The issue arises with SQL generated when using column names specified in `db_column` attributes in models, potentially leading to syntax errors as reported.

Let's examine the observed issue: when constructing the SQL statement for `ON CONFLICT`, Django uses the field names set in the model definition rather than the `db_column` values, leading to a mismatch with PostgreSQL expected column names.

Considering the provided runtime information, the next logical step is to analyze how Django constructs such SQL statements, specifically focusing on methods relevant to database operations during bulk updates with conflicts.

Therefore, the next observed method for further analysis should involve SQL generation within the bulk_create operations.

Observed method: `django/db/models/query.py:QuerySet.bulk_create`

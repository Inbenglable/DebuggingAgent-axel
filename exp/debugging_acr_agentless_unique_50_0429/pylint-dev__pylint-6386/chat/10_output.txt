Based on the analysis of the current observed code, the `_add_arguments_to_parser` method in the `arguments_manager.py` file is responsible for adding arguments to the parser sections. From the runtime information, we observe that arguments are being added to different groups within the argument parser. This process likely involves specifying how different options are interpreted, including whether an argument is expected for specific flags like `-v`.

The main issue observed here is related to the fact that the short `-v` option is incorrectly expecting an argument, whereas its functionality should mirror that of the long `--verbose` option, which does not require any argument. This discrepancy indicates that during the setup process, specifically in methods involved in adding arguments to the parser, the configuration for the `-v` flag has been mistakenly defined to expect an argument.

To further investigate and pinpoint the root cause, I will need to observe further into how these individual arguments, particularly the `verbose` option, are added to the parser and their configurations. The configuration that causes `-v` to require an argument must be traced within the `_add_parser_option` or similar function invoked in `_add_arguments_to_parser`.

Let's proceed by focusing on how these parser options are being set up and traced further to properly identify the configuration issue with `-v`.

Based on the information gathered, I have sufficient context and code to generate a patch. The issue lies in the inefficient caching strategy within the `get_resolver` function. The solution involves updating `get_resolver` to use `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` before the memoized function call is made, which will prevent constructing multiple `URLResolver` instances unnecessarily.

I have retrieved the code for `get_resolver` and the relevant portions of the `URLResolver._populate` method. Therefore, I am ready to generate the patch. 

Ready generation: `True`

## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Set disabled prop on ReadOnlyPasswordHashField
Description
	
Currently the django.contrib.auth.forms.UserChangeForm defines a clean_password method that returns the initial password value to prevent (accidental) changes to the password value. It is also documented that custom forms for the User model need to define this method: ​https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/auth/customizing/#a-full-example
A while ago the forms.Field base class gained the ​disabled argument to:
[disable] a form field using the disabled HTML attribute so that it won’t be editable by users. Even if a user tampers with the field’s value submitted to the server, it will be ignored in favor of the value from the form’s initial data.
It seems to me that this property could be set to True be default on the ReadOnlyPasswordHashField used to display the password hash. This way the clean_password is no longer necessary and the potential pitfall when using the ReadOnlyPasswordHashField without implementing clean_password is removed.

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
Based on the issue description, we need to locate the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` class, likely found in `django.contrib.auth.forms`, and examine its code to determine how to incorporate the `disabled` property by default. We also need to consider the interaction with the `UserChangeForm` in the same module.

Let's search for the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` class in the codebase to retrieve its source code.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ReadOnlyPasswordHashField")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_class_in_codebase("ReadOnlyPasswordHashField")
RESULT:
#### django/contrib/auth/forms.py:ReadOnlyPasswordHashField
```python
class ReadOnlyPasswordHashField(forms.Field):
    widget = ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        ...

    def bound_data(self, data, initial):
        ...

    def has_changed(self, initial, data):
        ...
```


==================================================

Your Output:
To address the issue, we need to modify the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` class found in `django/contrib/auth/forms.py`. We'll incorporate the `disabled` attribute into its `__init__` method. Since we haven't yet retrieved this method's code, we'll need to acquire it before making further modifications.

Let's search for the `__init__` method within the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` class.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/auth/forms.py", "ReadOnlyPasswordHashField.__init__")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_file("django/contrib/auth/forms.py", "ReadOnlyPasswordHashField.__init__")
RESULT:
#### django/contrib/auth/forms.py:ReadOnlyPasswordHashField.__init__
```python
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        kwargs.setdefault("required", False)
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

```


==================================================

Your Output:
Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

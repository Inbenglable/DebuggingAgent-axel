To address the issue, I need to access the source code of the `Text` class in `lib/matplotlib/text.py` to implement the getter and setter methods and potentially add a new attribute to manage the antialiasing state. Additionally, I need to review the `RendererAgg.draw_text` method in `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_agg.py` to modify it to use the new per-instance antialiasing attribute.

Let's proceed to retrieve the necessary code:

```python
search_class_in_file("lib/matplotlib/text.py", "Text")
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_agg.py", "RendererAgg.draw_text")
```

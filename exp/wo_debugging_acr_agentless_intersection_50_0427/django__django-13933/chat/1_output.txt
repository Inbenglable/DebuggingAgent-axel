To address the issue, we need to modify the error message in the `ModelChoiceField` class to include the invalid choice value. However, before we can generate the patch, we need to retrieve the source code for the `ModelChoiceField` class to understand how to make these changes.

The issue already provides us with the problematic default error message within the `ModelChoiceField` class, but to ensure that we have the entire context, I'll search for the complete code of the `ModelChoiceField` class within the codebase.

First, I'll search for the `ModelChoiceField` class to locate its file and verify the current implementation.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ModelChoiceField")
```

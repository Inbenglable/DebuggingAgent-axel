To resolve the issue where `Dataset.merge` fails with a `DataArray`, we need to look into the `dataset_merge_method` function used within the `Dataset.merge` method. According to the description and the traceback, the problem arises because the `dataArray` is not being handled correctly within the `merge` implementation.

I've already retrieved the `Dataset.merge` method implementation, but I don't have the source code for `dataset_merge_method`. I need to understand how the `dataset_merge_method` function works in order to modify it to handle `DataArray` inputs correctly. Therefore, I will search for the `dataset_merge_method` function.

```python
search_method_in_file("xarray/core/merge.py", "dataset_merge_method")
```

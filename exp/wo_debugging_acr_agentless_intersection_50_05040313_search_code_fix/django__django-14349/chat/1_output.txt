To resolve the issue, I need to look at the implementation of `URLValidator` and possibly its surrounding context in Django's codebase. Additionally, exploring the related test cases in the `validators.tests.TestValidators` class would help assess how they are interacting with URL validation.

Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code for `URLValidator` and also check out the tests in `validators.tests.TestValidators`.

Here's how I will proceed:

```python
search_method_in_codebase("URLValidator")
search_class_in_codebase("TestValidators")
```

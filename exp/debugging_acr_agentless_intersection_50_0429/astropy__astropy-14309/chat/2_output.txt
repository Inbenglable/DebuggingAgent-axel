The issue arises from the `is_fits` function in the `astropy/io/fits/connect.py` file. The error occurs when attempting to access `args[0]` in this line:

```python
return isinstance(args[0], (HDUList, TableHDU, BinTableHDU, GroupsHDU))
```

The problem occurs because `args` is an empty tuple, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the first element.

Given this observation, there needs to be a check to ensure that `args` is not empty before trying to access `args[0]`. This check can prevent the `IndexError` and handle the situation gracefully when `args` is indeed empty.

Since the issue is clearly in the identified access to `args[0]`, I can pinpoint where the fix is required:

Buggy method: `astropy/io/fits/connect.py:is_fits`

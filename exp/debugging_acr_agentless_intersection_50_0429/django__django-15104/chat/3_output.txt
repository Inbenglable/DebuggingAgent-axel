The abnormal program behavior currently observed is not directly related to the Django migration issue but rather to a `NameError` that occurs due to incorrect setup within the test infrastructure. Specifically, the error happens because `sys` is not imported or defined before it is used to adjust `sys.path`.

Apart from this infrastructural issue, the focus should be on the abnormal behavior within the `MigrationAutodetector._detect_changes` method, which is where the `KeyError` occurs related to the disrupted expectations from the `deconstruct` method in the custom `ForeignKey`.

The method `_detect_changes` in the `MigrationAutodetector` class is crucial because it orchestrates the change detection when models are modified, involving field deconstruction, including ForeignKey references. The removed `'to'` key from the custom ForeignKey field's `deconstruct` output disrupts this process, causing the `KeyError`.

Considering this, we should further delve into methods or parts of the `_detect_changes` that handle field deconstruction or ForeignKey processing directly. Thus, analyzing the trace information around the invocation of `generate_renamed_models()` and `_prepare_field_lists()` (as indicated by lines 158 to 162 in the trace scope) points towards helping locate any relevant processes or logic that handle model relationships and might be encountering missing data due to the custom field.

However, since the current test infrastructure issue blocks us from proceeding further in runtime observation, a manual analysis is warranted to guide the exploration or fix any setup errors before continuing with runtime traces.

Next, I'll aim to observe the execution of the `generate_renamed_models` method, as generating renamed models seems to interact with field deconstruction directly. This will give insight into how fields are processed before the field list preparation step, which might relate directly to the observed `KeyError`.

Observed method: `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py:MigrationAutodetector.generate_renamed_models`

The issue described arises from using the `union()` operation on QuerySets within a `ModelMultipleChoiceField`. When the form is submitted empty, all objects matching the queryset are added instead of none, as expected. This indicates a problem with how QuerySet unions are processed when the form is submitted without any selections.

To resolve this issue, it is necessary to review how Django handles `union()` operations in QuerySets and the behavior of `ModelMultipleChoiceField` during form submission when no selections are made. Specifically, I need to understand how the `union` affects the usual behavior when the form is submitted empty.

I need to retrieve the source code relevant to the `union()` operation on QuerySets and how it interacts with `ModelMultipleChoiceField`. I will start by searching for the `union()` method and related classes or methods involved in processing querysets and form fields in Django.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("QuerySet.union")
search_class_in_codebase("ModelMultipleChoiceField")
search_method_in_codebase("QuerySet.none")
```

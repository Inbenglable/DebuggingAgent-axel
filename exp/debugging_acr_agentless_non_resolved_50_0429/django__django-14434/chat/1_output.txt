The issue arises when attempting to create a mock database connection using `MockDatabaseWrapper`. The error message indicates that there's a missing required positional argument: 'settings_dict' in the constructor of the base `BaseDatabaseWrapper` class. This suggests that the `MockDatabaseWrapper` class omits this necessary argument when calling `super().__init__()`. 

The purpose of `settings_dict` is to provide configuration settings for the database connection, which are essential for initializing the `BaseDatabaseWrapper`. 

This means that the observed abnormal behavior is due to the incorrect implementation of the mocked database connection, which does not properly initialize its base class due to the missing `settings_dict`.

I will now examine the `MockDatabaseWrapper.__init__` method because that's where the error is occurring when the parent class is not being initialized correctly.

Observed method: `reproduce.py:MockDatabaseWrapper.__init__`

Here is the patch in the *SEARCH/REPLACE* format to resolve the issue:

```pythony
### django/forms/formsets.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or index < initial_form_count):
=======
        if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or (index is not None and index < initial_form_count)):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

And the edit result in JSON format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/forms/formsets.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or index < initial_form_count):\n=======\n        if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or (index is not None and index < initial_form_count)):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

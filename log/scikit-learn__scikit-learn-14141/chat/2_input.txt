You are a debugging agent tasked with precisely using tools to resolve issues and submit pull requests.

You are a debugging agent that traces the abnormal program to resolve project issues and submit pull requests.
Here is an issue in the scikit-learn project:
Add joblib in show_versions
joblib should be added to the dependencies listed in show_versions or added to the issue template when sklearn version is > 0.20.


Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
import sklearn
from sklearn.utils import _show_versions
version_info = _show_versions._get_sys_info() + _show_versions._get_deps_info()
print(version_info)
assert "joblib" in version_info, "joblib is not listed in sklearn's show_versions output"

This is the corresponding output and runtime information:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "run_debugging_test.py", line 6, in <module>
    import dbgsnooper  
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dbgsnooper'

(See above for error)


You need to trace the abnormal program behavior step by step to identify the root cause of the bug and locate the buggy method that contains the code to be fixed.
Note that a method showing abnormal program behavior may not be the buggy method since it could be an upstream method that caling the buggy method. Buggy method is the method that contains the buggy code needed to be fixed.
Now, please first analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior. 

If you can already locate the buggy method and buggy code, reply with:  
Buggy method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Otherwise, continue tracing by selecting the next method to observe. Reply with: 
Observed method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Note that {FILE_PATH} refers to the path relative to the repository.

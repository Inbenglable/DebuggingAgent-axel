Upon reviewing the patch and analyzing the test output before and after the patch, the following observations can be made:

1. **Patch Review:**
   - The proposed patch modifies the `__str__` method of the `Columns` class in the file `django/db/backends/ddl_references.py`.
   - The patch intends to ensure that there's proper whitespace between the column name and its suffix when the suffix is non-empty by adding a space only when the `col_suffixes[idx]` is not an empty string.

2. **Test Output Analysis:**
   - The test output prior to applying the patch resulted in a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module `django.db.migrations.operations.indexes`.
   - After applying the patch, the exact same error persists, indicating that the patch did not address the issue causing the test to fail.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The underlying error (`ModuleNotFoundError`) in the reproduce test isn't resolved by the patch, as it pertains to a module import, which the patch does not address.
   - Therefore, the current patch does not resolve the issue as the testing process still fails at the import stage and cannot validate whether whitespace is handled correctly in SQL statements.

Issue resolved: `False`

To address the issue of lists being coerced into tuples within the `resolve_lookup_value` method, we need to modify the code to ensure that the method maintains the original type of the input iterable (either list or tuple). Here's the patch in the search/replace format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/sql/query.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            value = tuple(resolved_values)\n=======\n            value = type(value)(resolved_values)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch ensures that instead of always converting resolved values into a tuple, we retain the original input type by constructing a new iterable of the same type as the input.

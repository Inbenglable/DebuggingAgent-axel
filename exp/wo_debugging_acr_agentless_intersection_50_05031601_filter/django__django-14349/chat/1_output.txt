To resolve this issue, I need to investigate how the `URLValidator` is currently implemented in the Django project. It is important to understand the existing validation process, particularly how it handles newline (`\n`), carriage return (`\r`), and tab (`\t`) characters.

To proceed, I'll need to retrieve the source code for the `URLValidator` as well as the test code that is failing.

Let's search for the `URLValidator` class within the codebase to analyze its functionality.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("URLValidator")
```

To resolve the issue, I need to understand the context in which `opts = cur_model._meta` is used and identify how the logic relating to `select_related` and `only` methods could be adjusted to handle proxy models correctly. The current gathered information provides partial insight into the logic. However, before generating the patch, examining whether additional source code around the `get_related_populators` function and its invocation context might give more thorough comprehension.

Given the current context, let's retrieve the `get_related_populators` method's source code for further analysis.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/query.py", "get_related_populators")
```

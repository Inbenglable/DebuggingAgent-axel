To resolve the issue with the `urlize` function, I need to adjust the logic within the `trim_punctuation` function to correctly handle trailing punctuation after HTML entities. Here is the search/replace configuration to fix the issue:

```pythony
### django/utils/html.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                middle = middle[:len(stripped) - len(middle_unescaped)]
=======
                middle = middle[:len(stripped)]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The original search/replacement focuses on correcting the line within the `trim_punctuation` method that erroneously calculated the index slice of `middle`. By simplifying the line to represent just the length of `stripped`, it correctly handles the trailing punctuation after unescaped HTML entities.

Now, let's put it in the correct JSON format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/utils/html.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                middle = middle[:len(stripped) - len(middle_unescaped)]\n=======\n                middle = middle[:len(stripped)]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

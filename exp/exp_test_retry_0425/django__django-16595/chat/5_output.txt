The root cause of the issue is identified in the `AlterField.reduce` method from `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py`. I have already obtained the source code for this method. With this information, I am ready to generate the patch to address the issue of reducing multiple consecutive `AlterField` operations.

Ready generation: `True`

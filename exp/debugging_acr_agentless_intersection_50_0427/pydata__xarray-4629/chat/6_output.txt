Based on the analysis, the issue stems from the `merge_attrs` function in `xarray/core/merge.py`, where attributes are being referenced instead of copied when `combine_attrs='override'` is specified. The solution is to modify this specific case to ensure that a deep copy of the variable attributes is made.

Here's the search/replace patch to fix the issue:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### xarray/core/merge.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    elif combine_attrs == \"override\":\n        return variable_attrs[0]\n=======\n    elif combine_attrs == \"override\":\n        return dict(variable_attrs[0])\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch changes the line within the `merge_attrs` function, ensuring that when `combine_attrs='override'` is used, the attributes are deep copied using `dict(variable_attrs[0])` instead of just referencing `variable_attrs[0]`.

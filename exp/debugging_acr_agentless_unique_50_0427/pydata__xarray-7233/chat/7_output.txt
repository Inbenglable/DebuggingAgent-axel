To generate a patch, I need to first retrieve the source code of the `Coarsen.construct` method from the `xarray/core/rolling.py` file, as this is the method identified with the observed scope likely containing the bug related to non-dimensional coordinates being handled.

```python
search_method_in_file("xarray/core/rolling.py", "Coarsen.construct")
```

I need to review the implementation of the `hist()` method from Matplotlib to understand how it's handling the `range` parameter, particularly when `density=True`. Given the provided information, I'm unsure of the exact file path where this method is implemented. Thus, I need to perform a search in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("hist")
```

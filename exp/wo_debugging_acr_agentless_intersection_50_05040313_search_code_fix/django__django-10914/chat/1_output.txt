To resolve the issue, I need to modify the Django codebase to set default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644. This change would involve understanding where the FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION is currently defined and how it is used in the `FileSystemStorage`. 

I need to fetch the source code related to file uploads and storage to understand and modify it accordingly. Specifically, I should look into the `FileSystemStorage` class and its methods handling uploaded files. 

Let's retrieve the relevant source code to proceed.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("FileSystemStorage")
search_code_in_codebase("FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS")
```

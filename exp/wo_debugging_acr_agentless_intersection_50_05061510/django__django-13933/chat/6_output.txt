The issue described indicates that `ModelChoiceField` should include the invalid value when raising a `ValidationError`. The patch proposed modifies the `to_python` method in the `ModelChoiceField` class to include the invalid choice's value in the `ValidationError` message.

However, the test outputs both before and after applying the patch indicate a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module 'reproducer'. This error prevents the test from executing, making it impossible to conclude whether the patch effectively addresses the original issue concerning the `ModelChoiceField`.

To resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError`, the testing environment needs the correct setup with a valid module named 'reproducer'. Without this environment configuration, the tests cannot run successfully, and the effectiveness of the patch remains indeterminable.

Thus, given the unchanged state of the test outputs coupled with the existing environment error, I cannot definitively assert that the issue has been resolved. Therefore:

Issue resolved: `False`

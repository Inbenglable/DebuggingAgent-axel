Based on the current analysis, the issue seems to be related to how the URLs for classes are generated and used in the SVG output of the inheritance diagram. We have seen that the `InheritanceGraph.generate_dot` method generates the URLs based on the classes, but it seems there is a gap in how relative URLs should be constructed for documents in different directories.

The `generate_dot` method is responsible for generating the DOT representation of the inheritance diagram, which includes setting URL attributes. Since the incorrectly constructed URLs are showing up in the diagrams when embedded in HTML files not at the root directory, the issue seems tied to this specific function.

To further diagnose the problem in `InheritanceGraph.generate_dot`, examining the path resolution logic when creating URLs for nodes might reveal how these URLs become incorrect when embedded into HTML documents located in subdirectories.

However, if these links in the DOT are improperly formatted, it suggests that `generate_dot` might be making assumptions about the base path that are only correct when the document is at the root.

Therefore, I need to continue tracing the method where URLs are constructed and possibly misallocated in `InheritanceGraph.generate_dot`.

Observed method: `sphinx/ext/inheritance_diagram.py:InheritanceGraph.generate_dot`

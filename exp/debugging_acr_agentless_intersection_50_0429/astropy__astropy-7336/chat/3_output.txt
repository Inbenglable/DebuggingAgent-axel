Analyzing the traceback, it shows an error caused by attempting to call the `to` method on a `NoneType` object. The decorator `quantity_input` tries to apply unit conversion based on type hints.

The issue arises here:
```plaintext
File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/astropy__astropy-7336/astropy/units/decorators.py", line 224, in wrapper
return return_.to(wrapped_signature.return_annotation)
```

The decorator assumes the function will return a value that can be converted, but in the reproducer case, the constructor is expected to return `None`, leading to the observed error.

To resolve the issue, we need to alter this logic, possibly by checking if the function returns `None` before attempting conversion.

Thus, I'll start by examining the `wrapper` method in `astropy/units/decorators.py` to understand how it handles the return type annotations.

Observed method: `astropy/units/decorators.py:QuantityInput.wrapper`

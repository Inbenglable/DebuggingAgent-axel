<ISSUE>
Callable storage on FileField fails to deconstruct when it returns default_storage
Description
	
If the storage argument on a FileField is set to a callable that returns default_storage, it is omitted from the deconstructed form of the field, rather than being included as a reference to the callable as expected.
For example, given a model definition:
from django.core.files.storage import FileSystemStorage, default_storage
from django.db import models
import random
other_storage = FileSystemStorage(location='/media/other')
def get_storage():
	return random.choice([default_storage, other_storage])
class MyModel(models.Model):
	my_file = models.FileField(storage=get_storage)
repeatedly running makemigrations will randomly generate a migration that alternately includes or omits storage=myapp.models.get_storage on the FileField definition.
This case was overlooked in the fix for #31941 - the deconstruct method tests if self.storage is not default_storage to determine whether to add the storage kwarg, but at this point self.storage is the evaluated version, so it wrongly returns false for a callable that returns default_storage.

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
The issue at hand is related to how Django's `FileField` handles the `storage` argument, especially when it is a callable that potentially returns the `default_storage`. Here's a breakdown of what's happening based on the given output and code:

1. **Failure Observation**:
    - The problem occurs in the initialization of the `FileField` within the `MyModel` class.
    - Specifically, the problem arises when `storage=get_storage` is executed, and the callable evaluates to `default_storage`.
    - The stack trace reveals an error due to missing configuration for Django settings.

2. **Configuration Error**:
    - The error message `Requested setting STORAGES, but settings are not configured` indicates that the Django settings have not been properly configured, which is a core requirement for accessing settings like `STORAGES`.

3. **Callable Storage Issue**:
    - The essence of the issue is that `get_storage`, a callable that returns either `default_storage` or `other_storage`, leads to inconsistent migrations because of how its result is handled during field deconstruction.
    - If `get_storage` returns `default_storage`, the current logic may incorrectly treat it as if it should not be part of the field's deconstructed state due to how `self.storage` is evaluated.

4. **Potential Bug Location**:
    - The problem might stem from how `FileField` initializes its storage attribute and later, how it decides whether storage should be serialized.

Given this analysis, the abnormal behavior points to a problem in the handling of the storage attribute, likely in its initialization or deconstruction logic within the `FileField`.

Next, let's examine the `FileField` initialization method as it is directly involved in processing and evaluating the `storage` argument.

Observed method: `django/db/models/fields/files.py:FileField.__init__`
==================================================
Based on the observation of the code in the `FileField.__init__` method and the runtime information provided, here's a detailed breakdown:

### Analysis

1. **Initialization Logic of FileField**:
   - The method initializes the `storage` attribute. If no storage is specified, it defaults to `default_storage`.
   - If the `storage` argument is callable, it stores a reference to the callable (`self._storage_callable`) and then invokes the callable, storing the result in `self.storage`.

2. **Callable Storage Handling**:
   - The logic checks if the `storage` argument is callable and ensures that the result is an instance of `Storage`.
   - When the storage callable evaluates to `default_storage`, the existing logic checks its type after invocation (line 244).

3. **Potential Issue**:
   - Observing abnormal behavior, the issue seems to stem from the logic that evaluates the callable, storing either the result of `default_storage` or another storage without marking the difference for serialization in migration operations.

4. **Problem Manifestation**:
   - The error points to the inconsistency during field deconstruction, where `storage=myapp.models.get_storage` should be serialized but is omitted if `self.storage` evaluates to `default_storage`.
   - This is symptomatic of how Django decides whether to serialize the `storage` kwarg, which is flawed when a callable returns `default_storage`.

### Further Steps

In the context of the runtime failure and the logic observed, the problem potentially lies in the callable evaluation and serialization logic for the `storage` attribute. The intricate part seems to be in ensuring that storage callable references are appropriately deconstructed and serialized during migration creation.

To pinpoint this, further observation downstream of the `storage` logic is necessary, especially around handling and serialization of field arguments during migration operations.

#### Next Scope to Observe

To locate the exact segment of code responsible for the bug, particularly concerning the evaluation and serialization logic:
- Observed scope: `django/db/models/fields/files.py:240-245`

This will give deeper insight into how `storage` is evaluated and subsequently utilized, detailing any potential oversight in how `callable` references are preserved or omitted during deconstruct operations.
==================================================
### Analysis of Observed Code Segment

The observed runtime error indicates an issue with the configuration of the debugging tool rather than directly with the Django code at hand. The `AssertionError` in the trace is due to the failure of finding a specified file path. However, focusing on the Django code,

- The snippet in `FileField.__init__`, lines 240-245, primarily deals with the initialization of the `storage` attribute in `FileField`.
- The logic checks if `storage` is callable and retains a reference to the callable using `self._storage_callable` before invoking it to get the actual storage object.
- The observed behavior fits with the overall issue that arises when the callable `get_storage()` evaluates to `default_storage`.

### Identified Abnormal Program Behavior

- The abnormal behavior arises during the serialization for migrations, when `storage=myapp.models.get_storage` is omitted if the callable returns `default_storage`.
- The logic within `__init__` does handle callable storage reference retention, which may exhibit flaws downstream when this callable reference isn't considered during field deconstruction or serialization.

Given this scope, it appears that the root cause isn't localized solely in the `__init__` method, but the observed logic is crucial to understanding how a callable affects the storage setting. Hence, further tracing is necessary in the deconstruction logic to study how this retained callable reference determines serialization and eventually influences migrations.

### Next Scope for Observation

To properly trace down to where field serialization or deconstruction might mishandle callable references, the next observation should focus on the deconstruction method for the `FileField`.

#### Observed method: `django/db/models/fields/files.py:FileField.deconstruct`
==================================================
### Analysis of Observed Code and Runtime Information

The observed runtime error is related to the test setup rather than directly related to Django's code. However, focusing on the Django code being traced:

- **Functionality**: The `deconstruct` method is responsible for breaking down the field into components that can be used to serialize the field for migrations. This includes handling `upload_to` and `storage` attributes.
  
- **Current Logic**:
  - The method checks if the `storage` attribute is not `default_storage` before potentially including it in `kwargs` during deconstruction.
  - The logic assigns `kwargs["storage"]` to either `self._storage_callable` or `self.storage`, depending on which exists. 

- **Observed Abnormal Behavior**:
  - The bug issue points at inconsistency arising when `self.storage` evaluates to `default_storage` if it originates from a callable and gets omitted during migration serialization.
  - Lines 298-299: The conditional logic results in the omission of `storage` if the currently evaluated storage is `default_storage`.

### Inference

The problem likely lies in how the `deconstruct` method handles the storage attribute, particularly in deciding whether to serialize it. The reference to a callable should be preserved in situations even if the result of invocation equals `default_storage`.

### Buggy Method Identification

The issue seems to originate from the logic in the `deconstruct` method itself. The conditional check on line 298 can be a potential root cause where the callable return (`default_storage`) leads to omission.

Given the analysis, the suspected buggy method is:

- **Buggy Method**: `django/db/models/fields/files.py:FileField.deconstruct`

### Next Steps

The code line scope that needs modification is primarily involving lines 298-299 in the `deconstruct` method. The logic should ensure that callable references are appropriately serialized regardless of the current evaluated storage result.

==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the current issue, the `deconstruct` method of `FileField` in `django/db/models/fields/files.py` needs to be analyzed to understand how it handles the `storage` attribute, particularly when the storage is a callable returning `default_storage`. Since this method was identified as potentially problematic, I'd need to retrieve its source code to create an accurate patch.

Therefore, I'll search for the `deconstruct` method in the specified file.

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

To address the issue, I need to identify the specific section within pytest that handles test skipping, especially when the `--pdb` option is enabled. This generally involves looking into how pytest processes unittest test cases and manages their lifecycle, including the setup and teardown stages.

The evidence provided suggests a change in behavior between pytest versions 5.4.1 and 5.4.2 affecting skipped tests with the `--pdb` option. This indicates the possibility of a modification to how test skip conditions are evaluated when the debugger is attached.

I am currently lacking the specific code interfacing with unittest's lifecycle management when tests are skipped. Retrieving the source code related to the skipping and `--pdb` execution mechanism within pytest would be crucial to generating a proper patch. Typically, this would involve inspecting decorators or hooks interacting with unittest's test execution flow.

Let's start by looking into the unittest handling part within the pytest codebase to identify where skipped tests and `tearDown` logic with `--pdb` might be interacting.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("skip")
search_method_in_codebase("unittest.TestCase")
search_method_in_codebase("pytest.raises")
search_method_in_codebase("pytest.config")
search_method_in_codebase("pytest_runtest_call")
search_method_in_codebase("pytest_runtest_teardown")
search_method_in_codebase("pytest_configure")
```

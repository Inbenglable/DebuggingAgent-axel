Analyzing the current observed code and abnormal program behavior:

1. The user is trying to plot a bar chart using `ax.bar([np.nan], [np.nan])`. This results in an exception due to the stop iteration error. 

2. The traceback shows that the error occurs specifically in the `_safe_first_finite` function within `cbook`, called by the `_convert_dx` method in `axes/_axes.py`.

The `_convert_dx` method is attempting to convert the width of the bar and is using `_safe_first_finite` to find the first finite value, which raises `StopIteration` when no finite values are available (in this case because all values are NaN).

The bullet mentioned in the release notes might be related to how NaN values are handled during this conversion. If the code intended to improve handling NaN values causes the exception, it's likely the fix must be applied here.

To continue tracing the abnormal behavior and better understand the failure, I need to observe the `_safe_first_finite` method inside the `cbook`.

Observed method: `lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py:_safe_first_finite`

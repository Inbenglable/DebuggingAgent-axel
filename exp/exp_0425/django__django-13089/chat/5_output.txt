To address the issue, we need to modify the `_cull` method within the `DatabaseCache` class located in `django/core/cache/backends/db.py`. This method is responsible for removing excess cache entries when the cache reaches its maximum capacity. The error occurs when the `cursor.fetchone()` call returns `None`, leading to a `TypeError` due to an assumption that there's always a valid result from the query.

To resolve this, we will introduce a conditional check to ensure that the result of `cursor.fetchone()` is valid before proceeding with any further operations that require subscripting the result.

First, we need to obtain the source code of the `DatabaseCache._cull` method to make the necessary changes.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/cache/backends/db.py", "DatabaseCache._cull")
```

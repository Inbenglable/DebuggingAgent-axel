I need to retrieve the source code of the `post_process` method in the `ManifestStaticFilesStorage` class to ensure we address the issue correctly by initializing the `substitutions` variable. The earlier retrieved method from `ManifestFilesMixin` does not contain the expected logic where `substitutions` might be initialized or checked.

Therefore, I will search for the `ManifestStaticFilesStorage.post_process` method code directly to inspect the implementation details.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py", "ManifestStaticFilesStorage.post_process")
```

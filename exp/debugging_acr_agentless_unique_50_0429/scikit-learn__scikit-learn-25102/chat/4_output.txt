To resolve the issue, I need to examine the source code for the `_wrap_in_pandas_container` method in the `sklearn/utils/_set_output.py` file to understand how data wrapping currently occurs and identify how to incorporate dtype preservation logic.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/utils/_set_output.py", "_wrap_in_pandas_container")
```

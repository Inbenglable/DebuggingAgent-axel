The patch provided by the repair agent is intended to fix the bug by changing the indentation calculation within the `trim_docstring` function. Specifically, it modifies the code to skip the first line when calculating the minimum indentation, which aligns with the proposed solution in the issue description.

**Patch Analysis:**
- The patch changes the behavior of the `trim_docstring` function, ensuring it starts calculating indentation from the second line onward. This should theoretically address the problem described in the issue where the first line is not empty and causes errors.

**Test Output Analysis:**
- The original test output before and after applying the patch shows an ImportError: `cannot import name 'simplify_exception'`. This error indicates a problem with the test setup itself, specifically with importing the `simplify_exception` function from `django.contrib.admindocs.views`. Thus, the test fails due to an unrelated import error, not because of the issue the patch is meant to solve.

**Conclusion:**
- Since the test script fails due to an ImportError unrelated to the `trim_docstring` functionality, we cannot accurately determine if the patch resolves the original docstring processing issue. To verify if the patch fixes the issue, the test setup must be corrected first.

Issue resolved: `False`

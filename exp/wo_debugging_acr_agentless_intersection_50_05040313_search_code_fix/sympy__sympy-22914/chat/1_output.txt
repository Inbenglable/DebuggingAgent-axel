To resolve the issue, I need to add the methods `_print_Min` and `_print_Max` to the `PythonCodePrinter` class. 
I need to retrieve the source code of the `PythonCodePrinter` class to understand where these methods should be added.

Since the file path of `PythonCodePrinter` isn't specified, I'll search for the class in the codebase first.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("PythonCodePrinter")
```

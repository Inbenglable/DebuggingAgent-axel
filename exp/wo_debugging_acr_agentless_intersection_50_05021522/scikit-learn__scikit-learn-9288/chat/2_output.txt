To analyze the issue with the difference in results for `KMeans` using `n_jobs=1` versus `n_jobs > 1`, we need to delve deeper into the `k_means` function where the parallelization is likely handled. I'll begin by locating and reviewing the details of the `k_means` function to understand the parallel computations and pinpoint potential sources of inconsistency.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("k_means")
```

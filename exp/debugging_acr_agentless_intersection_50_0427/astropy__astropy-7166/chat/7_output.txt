To fix the issue with docstring inheritance for properties in the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass, we need to adjust the method `InheritDocstrings.__init__` to include logic for handling properties as well. This involves checking for attributes of type `property` and their underlying function (`fget`) for docstring inheritance purposes.

Here are the changes we'll apply:

```pythony
### astropy/utils/misc.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            if (inspect.isfunction(val) and
=======
            if ((inspect.isfunction(val) or isinstance(val, property)) and
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds a condition to check if the attribute is a property, thus allowing these to be processed for docstring inheritance alongside regular functions.

Now let's provide the final patch in the JSON format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### astropy/utils/misc.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            if (inspect.isfunction(val) and\n=======\n            if ((inspect.isfunction(val) or isinstance(val, property)) and\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Unexpected exception when multiplying geometry.Point and number
```python
from sympy import geometry as ge
import sympy

point1 = ge.Point(0,0)
point2 = ge.Point(1,1)
```

This line works fine
```python
point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)
```

But when I write the same this way it raises an exception
```python
point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2
```

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    130         # A point where only `dim` is specified is initialized

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

    220             s, o = Point._normalize_dimension(self, Point(other, evaluate=False))
    221         except TypeError:
--> 222             raise GeometryError("Don't know how to add {} and a Point object".format(other))
    223 
    224         coords = [simplify(a + b) for a, b in zip(s, o)]

GeometryError: Don't know how to add 2.0*Point2D(1, 1) and a Point object
```

The expected behaviour is, that both lines give the same result

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve this issue, I'll first need to examine the source code of the `Point` class, specifically the `__add__` method, as it is involved in the exception handling. Examining this method will help determine why the behavior differs when multiplying with a number prior to the addition of points. First, let's locate this method definition.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("Point.__add__")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("Point.__add__")
RESULT:
#### sympy/geometry/point.py:Point.__add__
```python
    def __add__(self, other):
        """Add other to self by incrementing self's coordinates by
        those of other.

        Notes
        =====

        >>> from sympy.geometry.point import Point

        When sequences of coordinates are passed to Point methods, they
        are converted to a Point internally. This __add__ method does
        not do that so if floating point values are used, a floating
        point result (in terms of SymPy Floats) will be returned.

        >>> Point(1, 2) + (.1, .2)
        Point2D(1.1, 2.2)

        If this is not desired, the `translate` method can be used or
        another Point can be added:

        >>> Point(1, 2).translate(.1, .2)
        Point2D(11/10, 11/5)
        >>> Point(1, 2) + Point(.1, .2)
        Point2D(11/10, 11/5)

        See Also
        ========

        sympy.geometry.point.Point.translate

        """
        try:
            s, o = Point._normalize_dimension(self, Point(other, evaluate=False))
        except TypeError:
            raise GeometryError("Don't know how to add {} and a Point object".format(other))

        coords = [simplify(a + b) for a, b in zip(s, o)]
        return Point(coords, evaluate=False)

```


==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

To resolve the issue with the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass not handling properties correctly, I first need to review the code for the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass. This will help me understand how it processes docstrings and specifically how it interacts with `inspect.isfunction`.

I need to locate the source code of the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass, which should be in the Astropy codebase. I will use the search APIs to find this class in the codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("InheritDocstrings")
```

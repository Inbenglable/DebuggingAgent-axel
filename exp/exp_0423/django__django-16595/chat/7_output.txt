I need to retrieve the source code for the `AlterField.reduce` method to understand how it currently implements the reduction logic for consecutive `AlterField` operations. I will search for the method directly in the file, `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py`. 

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py", "AlterField.reduce")
```

To determine which of the provided code snippets are relevant to the issue, let's analyze the returned content:

1. **Content from `sympy/physics/units/quantities.py:Quantity._collect_factor_and_dimension`**:
   - This snippet shows a deprecated method which refers to the `UnitSystem` class's `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method. It essentially serves as a forwarding function and is not relevant for fixing the actual issue in the modern codebase.
   
2. **Content from `sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py:UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension`**:
   - This snippet contains the implementation of the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method in the `UnitSystem` class, which is being used in the reported issue. It includes logic for handling different types of expressions, namely `Quantity`, `Mul`, `Pow`, `Add`, `Derivative`, `Function`, and other types.

Given the context of the issue, the second snippet (`UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension`) is crucial because it contains the active implementation of the method where we suspect the issue arises, regarding the dimensionless check for exponents.

Thus, the needed content to further investigate and possibly generate a patch is:

```
sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py:UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension
```

To resolve the issue with incorrect documentation of inherited classes, I will adjust how Sphinx formats the "Bases" section by modifying the `ClassDocumenter.add_directive_header` method. I'll enhance the `restify` function usage to ensure the full class name is displayed properly.

Let's apply the necessary changes:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            base_classes = [restify(cls) for cls in bases]\n=======\n            base_classes = [restify(cls, None) for cls in bases]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This change should ensure that `restify` receives the correct parameters to format the class names accurately, including fully qualifying mocked classes like `torch.nn.Module`. When generating the "Bases" section, we now pass an additional argument to `restify`, ensuring correct resolution of classes on the documentation page.

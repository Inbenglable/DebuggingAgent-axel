## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Callable storage on FileField fails to deconstruct when it returns default_storage
Description
	
If the storage argument on a FileField is set to a callable that returns default_storage, it is omitted from the deconstructed form of the field, rather than being included as a reference to the callable as expected.
For example, given a model definition:
from django.core.files.storage import FileSystemStorage, default_storage
from django.db import models
import random
other_storage = FileSystemStorage(location='/media/other')
def get_storage():
	return random.choice([default_storage, other_storage])
class MyModel(models.Model):
	my_file = models.FileField(storage=get_storage)
repeatedly running makemigrations will randomly generate a migration that alternately includes or omits storage=myapp.models.get_storage on the FileField definition.
This case was overlooked in the fix for #31941 - the deconstruct method tests if self.storage is not default_storage to determine whether to add the storage kwarg, but at this point self.storage is the evaluated version, so it wrongly returns false for a callable that returns default_storage.

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To address the issue, we need to modify the `deconstruct` method of the `FileField` class in Django's codebase. The task at hand involves ensuring that a callable passed to the `storage` argument is correctly included in the deconstructed form, even if it evaluates to `default_storage`.

First, we need to review the source code of the `deconstruct` method within the `FileField` class. I'll proceed to retrieve this method to generate the necessary patch.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("FileField.deconstruct")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("FileField.deconstruct")
RESULT:
#### django/db/models/fields/files.py:FileField.deconstruct
```python
    def deconstruct(self):
        name, path, args, kwargs = super().deconstruct()
        if kwargs.get("max_length") == 100:
            del kwargs["max_length"]
        kwargs["upload_to"] = self.upload_to
        if self.storage is not default_storage:
            kwargs["storage"] = getattr(self, "_storage_callable", self.storage)
        return name, path, args, kwargs

```


==================================================

Your Output:
To address the issue, I need to verify the definition and context of the `FileField` class in the specified `files.py` file. This will help ensure that any changes made to the `deconstruct` method are aligned with the overall structure and purpose of the class. Therefore, I will proceed to retrieve the full implementation of the `FileField` class.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/fields/files.py", "FileField")
```

Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_class_in_file("django/db/models/fields/files.py", "FileField")

    # The class to wrap instance attributes in. Accessing the file object off
    # the instance will always return an instance of attr_class.
    attr_class = FieldFile

    descriptor_class = FileDescriptor

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

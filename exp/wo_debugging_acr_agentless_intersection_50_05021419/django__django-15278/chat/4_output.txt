To resolve the issue, it's clear that the `DatabaseSchemaEditor` class plays a pivotal role in managing SQLite schema changes, including adding fields to tables. Based on the retrieved `DatabaseSchemaEditor` class code, we can see the method `add_field` which deals with adding fields taking into account field nullability and default values. SQLite's limitation in handling `NULL UNIQUE` constraints is indirectly addressed by the `_remake_table` method, which reconstructs tables rather than directly altering them when constraints are involved.

Given the context, I have retrieved relevant sections related to schema editing and the addition of fields, thus I'm ready to generate the patch without needing additional code knowledge. The solution will likely involve adjusting how nullable fields with unique constraints are added, possibly using the approach shown in `_remake_table`.

Ready generation: `True`

To resolve the issue of failing URLValidator tests due to changes in Python's URL splitting behavior, I need to first retrieve the source code for the `URLValidator` class and its relevant methods within Django. This will help me understand how URLs are currently being validated and how to incorporate logic to either reject URLs containing forbidden characters early or handle them according to the new recommendations.

I'll use the search APIs to locate and examine the `URLValidator` class and its methods.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("URLValidator")
search_method_in_codebase("URLValidator.__call__")
```

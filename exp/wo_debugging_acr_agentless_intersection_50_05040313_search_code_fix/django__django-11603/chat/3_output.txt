To address the issue of adding DISTINCT support for the Avg and Sum aggregates in Django, we will likely need to extend or modify the behavior of these classes to include DISTINCT handling in SQL queries. Given the brief class definitions obtained, it's necessary to retrieve additional context or methods associated with these classes for proper modification.

The `Aggregate` class looks like the superclass where DISTINCT support could be managed because all the aggregates subclass it. It is critical to understand how the superclass `Aggregate` works since this is where aggregation behaviors are likely defined.

Let's first retrieve the complete implementation of the `Aggregate` class from the same file `django/db/models/aggregates.py` to understand how these aggregations work and where DISTINCT handling can be included.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Aggregate")
```

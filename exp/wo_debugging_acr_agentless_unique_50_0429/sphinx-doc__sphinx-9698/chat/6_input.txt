An index entry with parens was registered for `py:method` directive with `:property:` option
### Describe the bug

An index entry with parens was registered for `py:method` directive with `:property:` option. It should not have parens.


### How to Reproduce

```
# index.rst

.. py:method:: Foo.bar
   :property:

.. py:property:: Foo.baz
```

### Expected behavior

An index entry for the property should not have parens.

==================================================
Your Output:
The issue at hand is related to how index entries are generated for `py:method` directives with the `:property:` option in the Sphinx documentation generator. Specifically, it seems that the bug causes these entries to mistakenly include parentheses, which are typically reserved for methods rather than properties.

To resolve this issue, I need to explore the part of the Sphinx codebase responsible for generating index entries for `py:method` and `:property:` directives. The relevant functionality is likely implemented in a method that performs processing of these directives or manages their registration into indexes. Hence, I need to locate and examine the source code associated with directive handling, particularly the `py:method` directive with `:property:` option.

To proceed, I will search for relevant methods or classes in the Sphinx codebase. I will first attempt to locate methods related to directive handling and index processing.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("handle_signature")
search_method_in_codebase("add_target_to_index")
search_method_in_codebase("add_property_to_index")
search_class_in_codebase("PyMethod")
search_class_in_codebase("IndexEntry")
```

==================================================

Your Output:
To resolve the issue, I need to examine the `PyMethod` class from the file `sphinx/domains/python.py`. The `get_index_text` method seems to be relevant because it likely handles the generation of index entries and could be responsible for adding parentheses when the `:property:` option is present. To proceed, I need to retrieve the source code of this specific method within the class.

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/domains/python.py", "PyMethod.get_index_text")

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

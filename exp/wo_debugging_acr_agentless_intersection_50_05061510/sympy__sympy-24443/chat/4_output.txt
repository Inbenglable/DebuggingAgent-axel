To resolve the issue with the `_image()` function related to `PermutationGroups` in the sympy combinatorics module, we need to examine the implementation of the `_image()` method. 

The search results returned implementations of `_image()` from the `sympy/polys/agca/homomorphisms.py` file, but these are associated with module homomorphisms rather than permutation groups. Since this issue is within the combinatorics module and specifically involves permutations, these results are irrelevant for this context. We require the version of `_image()` that applies to combinatorics rather than algebraic module homomorphisms.

Thus, none of the returned results are relevant for understanding the issue related to the `_image()` function in permutation groups. Therefore, I would not select any of them:

(Selecting none as they are irrelevant to the permutation group context)

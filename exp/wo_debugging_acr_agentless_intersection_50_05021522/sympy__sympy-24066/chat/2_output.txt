Upon analyzing the API returned content for the `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension` method, the primary focus is to identify the necessary implementation that correctly handles expressions involving units and dimensions within the SymPy physics unit system.

### Analysis:

1. **sympy/physics/units/quantities.py:Quantity._collect_factor_and_dimension**:
    - This method is primarily a wrapper around the `UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension` method and is deprecated. It's not directly responsible for the logic, and its presence indicates redirection to the `UnitSystem` class method. 
    - **Not Needed**: It's a deprecated method and does not contribute to solving the issue directly.

2. **sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py:UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension**:
    - This is the method where the actual logic for collecting factor and dimension from an expression is implemented.
    - It deals with expressions of type `Quantity`, `Mul`, `Pow`, `Add`, `Derivative`, `Function`, and `Dimension`, which indicates that it directly handles dimensional analysis.
    - A part of the description and the logic show where the issue might be arising, specifically within the handling of `Pow` and possibly `Function` expressions.
    - **Needed**: This is the critical method for understanding and fixing the dimensionless exponent issue.

Considering the functionality and relevance to the bug issue, the necessary content for resolving the problem is:

```
sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py:UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension
```

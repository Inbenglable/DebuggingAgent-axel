To address the issue with `QuerySet.only()` and `select_related()` when dealing with proxy models, we need to apply a patch to the `django/db/models/sql/query.py` file. The problem arises because the system attempts to use the meta options of proxy models directly, which results in an error. The fix involves using the concrete model's meta options instead. Here is the patch to resolve the issue:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/sql/query.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                opts = cur_model._meta\n=======\n                opts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch changes how the options are derived for proxy models, ensuring that the select and only operations function as expected without causing a crash.

The issue observed in the `call_command` function seems to be related to handling arguments that are part of a mutually exclusive group. The problem emerges when `call_command` is used with keyword arguments (`kwargs`) for such a group. This is confirmed by the `CommandError` that is raised due to incorrect treatment of mutually exclusive arguments.

The problem can be identified in the logic that constructs the `parse_args` list, specifically between lines 113-138 in the `call_command` method. The code parses arguments and handles required options but fails to address mutually exclusive groups correctly because it checks for `opt.required` but does not account for options that are part of required mutually exclusive groups.

To investigate this further and precisely identify any mismanagement of mutually exclusive groups, we need to observe the scope where the parser's actions are interacted with and arguments are constructed for parsing.

Observing the following lines should yield insights into how the parser is failing to manage mutually exclusive groups in conjunction with keyword arguments:

Observed scope: `django/core/management/__init__.py:114-138`

To resolve the issue, I need to locate the code pertaining to command-line arguments parsing in the pylint project, specifically how the `-v` and `--verbose` options are handled. This usually involves finding the configuration or utility scripts that process command-line inputs.

I'll start by searching for the method or code block related to argument parsing and handling for the `verbose` option in pylint.

```python
search_code_in_codebase("verbose")
search_code_in_codebase("-v")
search_code_in_codebase("--verbose")
```

To resolve the issue, I need to review the source code related to the function `pylint.run._query_cpu()` and also understand how the multiprocess `Pool` is initialized with the number of processes. Specifically, I would like to inspect the logic that leads to the value being cast to zero and the implementation of any relevant methods or logic surrounding the provided lines by the user.

Therefore, I will retrieve the method `pylint.run._query_cpu` and related code that uses `multiprocessing.Pool`.

```python
search_method_in_file("pylint/lint/run.py", "_query_cpu")
search_code_in_file("pylint/lint/run.py", "with multiprocessing.Pool")
```

To address the issue correctly, I need to examine the implementation of the `quantity_input` decorator, especially focusing on any parts that deal with the return value of the decorated function, as the error occurs due to the return type annotation `-> None`.

I need to retrieve the source code for the `quantity_input` decorator. Let's locate it in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("quantity_input")
```

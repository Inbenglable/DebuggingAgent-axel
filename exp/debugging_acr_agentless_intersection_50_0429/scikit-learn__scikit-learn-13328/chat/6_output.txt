The provided patch modifies the `HuberRegressor` code in the `sklearn/linear_model/huber.py` file to cast the boolean array `X` to a float type before performing further operations. The modification is made to the line:

```python
X_non_outliers = -axis0_safe_slice(X, ~outliers_mask, n_non_outliers)
```

replacing it with:

```python
X_non_outliers = -axis0_safe_slice(X.astype(float), ~outliers_mask, n_non_outliers)
```

This change ensures that any boolean arrays passed as the `X` parameter are converted to float arrays, thus preventing the `TypeError` encountered when using the `-` operator on boolean arrays.

Reviewing the test output before the patch, we can see the same `TypeError` is raised, as described in the issue. After applying the patch, the error is no longer present, and the message "Issue is fixed." is printed, indicating that the test ran successfully without any exceptions.

Therefore, based on the patch analysis and the comparison of test outputs before and after the patch, the issue is resolved.

Issue resolved: `True`

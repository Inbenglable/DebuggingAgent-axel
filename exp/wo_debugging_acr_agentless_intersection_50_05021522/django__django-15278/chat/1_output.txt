To resolve the issue with adding a nullable OneToOneField crashing on SQLite, we need to understand how Django performs migrations involving `OneToOneField` and SQLite's handling of such schema changes. The error arises from SQLite's inability to add a unique column in the way Django's migration is attempting. To address this, a patch will likely involve updating how Django performs this type of migration specifically for SQLite.

Before generating any patch, it's necessary to review Django's code involved in handling database schema migrations, focusing specifically on how it generates SQL for adding fields of type `OneToOneField`.

I will retrieve the source code involved in the Django migration system, focusing on SQLite-specific backend implementations and alterations related to database schema. Typically, this would include classes and methods that are part of the migration framework, such as `SchemaEditor` or related components.

Let's start by retrieving relevant code.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("SchemaEditor")
search_method_in_codebase("add_field")
search_method_in_codebase("create_model")
search_class_in_codebase("SQLiteSchemaEditor")
```

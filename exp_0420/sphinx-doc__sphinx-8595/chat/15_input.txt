You need to trace the abnormal program to resolve project issues and submit pull requests.
Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **sphinx** project:
#### ISSUE
autodoc: empty __all__ attribute is ignored
**Describe the bug**
autodoc: empty `__all__` attribute is ignored

**To Reproduce**
```
# example.py
__all__ = []


def foo():
    "docstring"


def bar():
    "docstring"


def baz():
    "docstring"
```
```
# index.rst
.. automodule:: example
   :members:
```

All foo, bar, and baz are shown.

**Expected behavior**
No entries should be shown because `__all__` is empty.

**Your project**
No

**Screenshots**
No

**Environment info**
- OS: Mac
- Python version: 3.9.1
- Sphinx version: HEAD of 3.x
- Sphinx extensions: sphinx.ext.autodoc
- Extra tools: No

**Additional context**
No


Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
# conf.py
import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))

project = 'Test'
copyright = '2023'
author = 'Test'

extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc']


doc_source = '''# example.py
__all__ = []

def foo():
    "docstring"

def bar():
    "docstring"

def baz():
    "docstring"
''''

index_source = '''# index.rst
.. automodule:: example
   :members:
''''


# Creating the example.py file
with open('example.py', 'w') as f:
    f.write(doc_source)

# Creating the index.rst file
with open('index.rst', 'w') as f:
    f.write(index_source)

from sphinx.application import Sphinx

# Running the Sphinx build
app = Sphinx(srcdir='.', confdir='.', outdir='_build', doctreedir='_build/doctrees', buildername='html')
app.build()



This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
The error encountered in the testing script (`EOL while scanning string literal (debugging_test.py, line 24)`) indicates that there's a problem with the string literals in the script. Specifically, the string is not terminated properly, causing a syntax error.

Here's the issue in the observed code:
```python
doc_source = '''# example.py
__all__ = []

def foo():
    "docstring"

def bar():
    "docstring"

def baz():
    "docstring"
''''

index_source = '''# index.rst
.. automodule:: example
   :members:
''''
```

The string literals for `doc_source` and `index_source` have been terminated incorrectly.

To fix this, the string literals should be properly enclosed with the correct number of quotes:

```python
doc_source = '''# example.py
__all__ = []

def foo():
    "docstring"

def bar():
    "docstring"

def baz():
    "docstring"
'''

index_source = '''# index.rst
.. automodule:: example
   :members:
'''
```

I will go ahead and make the necessary changes to ensure the strings are properly terminated.

However, this is a fix in the test code and does not address the actual issue reported with the `sphinx` project. We need to identify the root cause of the bug where an empty `__all__` attribute is ignored.

The issue lies in the implementation of `sphinx.ext.autodoc` where it determines which members to include. I suspect it involves checking the `__all__` attribute.

Next, I'll observe the method responsible for identifying and including members in the documentation.

Observed method: `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:get_object_members`
==================================================
The issue reported suggests that when the `__all__` attribute is empty, all members of the module are being included in the documentation. According to the intended behavior, if `__all__` is empty, no members should be included.

From the observations, it appears that the method `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:get_object_members` is responsible for retrieving members of a class for documentation. The specific class documenter method `ClassDocumenter.get_object_members` seems to be where the members are filtered based on options and conditions including the presence of an `__all__` attribute.

The method checks the `want_all` parameter and the `self.options.members` to determine which members to include. To identify whether this method correctly handles the empty `__all__` attribute, we need to further observe how the `want_all` flag and the `self.options` attributes are set and used.

We need to check the code section where `want_all` and `self.options.members` conditions are processed, as an empty `__all__` attribute should lead to no members being selected.


### Next Step:
We need to trace deeper into the conditional logic that processes member inclusion. Specifically, let's observe lines 1627-1638 to see how the `want_all` and `self.options.members` conditions are handled.

```python
Observed scope: sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:1627-1638
```
==================================================
I've analyzed the code snippet within the `ClassDocumenter.get_object_members` method. The logic appears to check the `want_all` flag and the `self.options.members`. If `want_all` is `False` and `self.options.members` is not specified, the method should return no members. However, there is no explicit condition handling an empty `__all__` attribute leading to an empty members list.

Based on the issue, the empty `__all__` attribute means no members should be selected. Since the observed code snippet doesn't account for an empty `__all__` resulting in no members, we need to trace where the `want_all` flag and the `self.options.members` are set and handle empty `__all__`.

Next, I'll observe how the `want_all` flag and the `self.options.members` are set. The setup likely happens earlier in the `ClassDocumenter` class or other related parts of the `autodoc` module where the options parameters are initialized and `__all__` is processed.

### Next Observation:
We need to locate the class initialization of `ClassDocumenter` or relevant parts where `want_all` and `self.options.members` conditions are set or processed.

My next step is to observe `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:ClassDocumenter.__init__`

Observed method: `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:ClassDocumenter.__init__`

Let's proceed with observing this method to further trace the abnormal program behavior.
==================================================
Based on the analysis of the `ClassDocumenter.__init__` method, it appears that we haven't located the specific logic processing the `__all__` attribute that leads to the inclusion of members in the documentation. The current error in the testing script needs to be fixed before proceeding further.

Assuming the error in the testing script has been addressed and we are focusing on identifying the root cause of the bug, I need to observe where the `__all__` attribute is evaluated within the `autodoc` module. This would be typically handled in the member retrieval logic, where it looks into the module and its attributes.

Given the current file trace indicators, let's investigate how the `__all__` attribute is checked within the context of member inclusion. It might be handled somewhere in the general member retrieval process rather than in the `ClassDocumenter` directly.

Next, I'll trace the scope where members of the module are fetched with respect to the `obj` parameter, as `__all__` would impact it.

### Next Observation:
Let's observe the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:get_object_members` method.

```python
Observed scope: sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:1600-1610
```

The scope includes logic involving members, options, and should ideally show how `__all__` is considered.

With this deeper observation, we should be able to identify where we need to implement a condition to consider an empty `__all__` attribute and appropriately return no members.

Let's proceed.
==================================================
Based on the analysis and the observed code, the root cause of the bug appears to involve how the empty `__all__` attribute is handled. Currently, the logic in the `ClassDocumenter.get_object_members` method does not appropriately handle the case when `__all__` is empty.

I suspect that the handling of the `__all__` attribute should be explicitly coded to ensure no members are included when it is empty.

Given the analysis so far, we should examine how `__all__` is evaluated during the member extraction process, and likely make a modification to the `get_object_members` method to include this special handling.

### Next Observation:
Let's observe the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:get_object_members` method, specifically focusing on the relevant code section starting at line 1645 where member processing occurs.

Observed method: `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:get_object_members`

Let's take a closer look.

==================================================
Based on the current analysis and observations, the issue appears to lie in how the `__all__` attribute is handled within the `get_object_members` method. Specifically, there is no check implemented to handle the case when `__all__` is empty.

To resolve this issue, I will need to locate where the `__all__` attribute is processed and ensure that if it is empty, no members should be included.

The runtime information shows an error in the testing script, which needs to be fixed separately. However, our focus is on the root cause of the bug within the `sphinx` project code, especially in the `ClassDocumenter.get_object_members` method.

Given the specifics of the observed code, the next step is to trace the implementation that handles the `__all__` attribute within the `get_object_members` method.

### Next Observation:
Let's observe a more detailed code section around the lines where member processing occurs, specifically starting from line 1645 to ensure that the `__all__` attribute handling is correctly implemented.

Observed scope: `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:1645-1660`

This should provide insights into how `__all__` is checked and where we need to add the relevant condition.

Let's proceed with this observation.
==================================================


Now you choose ClassDocumenter.get_object_members's code snippet

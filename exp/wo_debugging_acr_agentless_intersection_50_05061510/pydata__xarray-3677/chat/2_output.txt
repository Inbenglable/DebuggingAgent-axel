To address the issue effectively, I need to determine how `dataset_merge_method` and `merge_core` work, as they seem to be involved in failing to merge a `DataArray` into a `Dataset`. I'll retrieve the source code for both methods to better understand the underlying cause. 

```python
search_method_in_file("xarray/core/merge.py", "dataset_merge_method")
search_method_in_file("xarray/core/merge.py", "merge_core")
```

To implement the `--skip-checks` option, I've gathered the necessary source code for the `BaseCommand` class, and I've also examined its methods: `add_arguments`, `execute`, and `_run_checks`. These cover the addition of command-line arguments and handling of the checks. Thus, I'm ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

To resolve the issue, I need to inspect the implementation of the `ReprPrinter` class to determine the best way to add handling for `set` and `dict` types. This is necessary to ensure that these types are printed using SymPy's `FiniteSet` and `Dict` representations, respectively.

I'll proceed with retrieving the source code for the `ReprPrinter` class to identify if any helper methods or existing mechanisms can be leveraged or modified for this purpose.

```python
search_class_in_file("sympy/printing/printer.py", "ReprPrinter")
```

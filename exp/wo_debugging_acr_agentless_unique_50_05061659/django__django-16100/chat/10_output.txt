Let's review the patch and the test outputs:

### Patch Review:
1. The patch aims to add transaction handling to the `changelist_view` by importing `transaction.atomic` and wrapping the block that processes POST requests in a transaction.
2. It introduces the transaction context with `with transaction.atomic():` at the correct location inside the conditional block processing POST data.

### Test Output Analysis:
#### Original Output:
The original error pertains to Django settings not being configured, indicating an issue with setting up the test environment rather than pointing directly to the absence of transaction handling in `changelist_view`.

#### Patched Output:
The patched output shows a new error: `IndentationError: expected an indented block`. This suggests that there is a syntax error in the patch. Importingly, the presence of `IndentationError` indicates improper indentation, potentially due to incorrect integration of `with transaction.atomic():` in the patch.

### Conclusion:
The test output does not confirm the resolution of the issue, as the patched code does not correctly run due to a syntax error. The transaction handling intended to be added was not properly indented, leading to execution failure of the test.

Therefore, the issue is not resolved since the patched code did not successfully run due to the syntax error.

Issue resolved: `False`

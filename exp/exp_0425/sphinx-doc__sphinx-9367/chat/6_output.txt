To generate the patch, I need to retrieve the source code for the `visit_Tuple` method within the `_UnparseVisitor` class in the `sphinx/pycode/ast.py` file. This is necessary to identify how tuples are currently being processed and to apply the fix. Let's proceed with fetching that method's code.

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/pycode/ast.py", "_UnparseVisitor.visit_Tuple")
```

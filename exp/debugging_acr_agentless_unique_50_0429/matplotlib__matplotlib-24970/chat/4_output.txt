To create an effective patch, I need to gather the source code for the `NoNorm.__call__` method. This is crucial for understanding the current implementation and applying the necessary fixes to handle out-of-bound integer values correctly, as per the deprecation warnings in NumPy.

Since I have the file path of the method (`lib/matplotlib/colors.py`), I will search for the `NoNorm.__call__` method within the file.

```python
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/colors.py", "NoNorm.__call__")
```

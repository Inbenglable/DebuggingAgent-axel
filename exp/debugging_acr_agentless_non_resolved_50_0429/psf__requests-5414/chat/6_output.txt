To resolve the issue, I need to modify the `Adapter.send` method in the `requests/adapters.py` file to catch `LocationParseError` from `urllib3` and raise the appropriate `InvalidURL` exception.

I will need to retrieve the source code of the `Adapter.send` method to make the necessary changes. 

```python
search_method_in_file("requests/adapters.py", "Adapter.send")
```

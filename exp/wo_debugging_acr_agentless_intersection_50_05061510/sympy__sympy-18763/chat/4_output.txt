To resolve the issue with parenthesizing in the LaTeX output for the `Subs` class, I need to find the method responsible for generating the LaTeX representation. It is typically named `_latex` or something similar within the class. I will search for this method within the `sympy/core/function.py` file where the `Subs` class is defined.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/core/function.py", "Subs._latex")
```

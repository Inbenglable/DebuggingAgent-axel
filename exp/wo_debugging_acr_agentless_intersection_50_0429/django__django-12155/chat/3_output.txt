Based on the identified issue and the `trim_docstring` function in the `django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py` file, I will proceed to make the necessary adjustment to skip the first line when determining the indentation. This should resolve the reported error without affecting the original functionality.

Here are the search/replace patches for the fix.

```pythony
### django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())
=======
    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's provide the JSON format for this single search/replace edit.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())\n=======\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch will skip the first line when calculating the indentation, thus avoiding the error when the first line of the docstring is not empty.

To resolve the issue with the incorrect import ordering in Django migration files, it is necessary to review the code responsible for generating these migration files. The problem likely stems from the Django migration framework, possibly contained within the management commands or migration classes.

To proceed, I must search for the code that generates migrations. This involves identifying the relevant part of Django's codebase that handles migration file creation. Likely candidates are within Django's migration modules or files related to management commands.

I'll start by searching for the method used to create migration files, which might be part of Django's migration framework. This involves searching for code related to the migration generation process.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("create_migration")
search_method_in_codebase("write_migration_file")
search_class_in_codebase("MigrationAutodetector")
search_class_in_codebase("MigrationWriter")
```
By reviewing the source code of these methods or classes, I will be able to identify where to adjust the import ordering.

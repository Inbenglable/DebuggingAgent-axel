Let's analyze the abnormal program behavior and the information provided.

The traceback shows that an `IndexError` was raised while running the `sylow_subgroup()` method from the `PermutationGroup` class in the file `sympy/combinatorics/perm_groups.py`. This error occurs specifically at this line within the `minimal_blocks()` method:

```python
del num_blocks[i], blocks[i]
```

The error "list assignment index out of range" suggests that there's an attempt to delete elements from lists `num_blocks` and `blocks` using an index `i` that is not valid (either because it exceeds the list boundaries or the lists are empty).

For the error to occur in `sylow_subgroup()`, the issue might originate from:

1. Logic leading up to the deletion step in `minimal_blocks`, where `i`, `num_blocks`, or `blocks` are calculated or assumed incorrectly.
2. `minimal_blocks()` could be operating on a specific input configuration that wasn't expected or handled correctly.

Given that the error emanates from `minimal_blocks()`, and considering the current traceback and error context, it is prudent to further investigate the logic and internals of the `minimal_blocks()` method as it seems directly tied to the source of the issue.

Thus, the next step is to observe the `minimal_blocks` method in detail.

Observed method: `sympy/combinatorics/perm_groups.py:PermutationGroup.minimal_blocks`

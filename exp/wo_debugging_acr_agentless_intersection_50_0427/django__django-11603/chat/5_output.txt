To implement DISTINCT support for the `Avg` and `Sum` aggregates, we'll update the `allow_distinct` attribute from `False` to `True` in their class definitions within the `django/db/models/aggregates.py` file.

Here's the patch to make these changes:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):\n    function = 'AVG'\n    name = 'Avg'\n=======\nclass Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):\n    function = 'AVG'\n    name = 'Avg'\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):\n    function = 'SUM'\n    name = 'Sum'\n=======\nclass Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):\n    function = 'SUM'\n    name = 'Sum'\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch updates the `Avg` and `Sum` class definitions to allow the DISTINCT keyword to be used, thereby resolving the issue.

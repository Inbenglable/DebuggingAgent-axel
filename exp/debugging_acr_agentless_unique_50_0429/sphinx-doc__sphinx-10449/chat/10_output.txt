From the analysis, it appears that the `ClassDocumenter.format_signature` and `FunctionDocumenter.format_signature` methods in the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file implement the handling of signatures. However, the class-level return type issue seems to be indirectly associated with how `autodoc_typehints` is used under the "description" setting.

Considering the insights provided by the tracing efforts and the source code for these classes and methods, I've identified that the issue is likely rooted in improperly managing type hints when integrating them into documentation, specifically for class initializers. This integration misinterprets constructor signatures, leading them to be displayed as class-level return types.

The source code I've reviewed should be enough to proceed with generating a patch that rectifies this behavior by adjusting how type hints from initializers are handled and ensuring they are not expressed as return types at the class level.

Ready generation: `True`

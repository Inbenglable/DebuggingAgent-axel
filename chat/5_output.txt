To address the issue without disrupting original functionality, we'll tweak the separability logic. Focus will be on correcting how nested `CompoundModels` are handled, ensuring the separability is computed correctly for nested scenarios.

Here's the proposed `SEARCH/REPLACE` edit:

```python
### astropy/modeling/separable.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        return _operators[transform.op](sepleft, sepright)
=======
        # Apply corrective handling for nested compound models
        if isinstance(transform, Model) and isinstance(sepleft, np.ndarray) and isinstance(sepright, np.ndarray):
            # Check if transform is a compound model and return correctly handled output
            if isinstance(sepleft[0], np.ndarray):
                sepleft = np.eye(transform.left.n_outputs, transform.left.n_inputs)
            if isinstance(sepright[0], np.ndarray):
                sepright = np.eye(transform.right.n_outputs, transform.right.n_inputs)
        return _operators[transform.op](sepleft, sepright)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### Explanation:
- **SEARCH Block**: The current operation which incorrectly uses nested model logic in `_operators` returning non-correct separability matrices.
- **REPLACE Block**: Provides improved logic. It corrects separability evaluations for nested compound models ensuring proper matrix handling to detect independence per compound layer.

After applying this patch, the nested model functionality is evaluated correctly while ensuring code is still original in functionality for non-nested models.

### JSON Output

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "astropy/modeling/separable.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        return _operators[transform.op](sepleft, sepright)\n=======\n        # Apply corrective handling for nested compound models\n        if isinstance(transform, Model) and isinstance(sepleft, np.ndarray) and isinstance(sepright, np.ndarray):\n            # Check if transform is a compound model and return correctly handled output\n            if isinstance(sepleft[0], np.ndarray):\n                sepleft = np.eye(transform.left.n_outputs, transform.left.n_inputs)\n            if isinstance(sepright[0], np.ndarray):\n                sepright = np.eye(transform.right.n_outputs, transform.right.n_inputs)\n        return _operators[transform.op](sepleft, sepright)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE"
  ]
}
```

This adjustment ensures nested compound models maintain independent separability as expected. The edits are strategically constructed to efficiently adapt the current operation without altering original functionality for correctly handled cases.

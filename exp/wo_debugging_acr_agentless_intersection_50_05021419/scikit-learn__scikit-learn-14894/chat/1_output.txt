To resolve this issue, we'll need to examine the `_sparse_fit` method in the scikit-learn codebase to identify how it handles the case of empty `support_vectors_`. This method seems to be a key function where the error occurs. Additionally, we may need to retrieve the `dual_coef_indices.size` code segment to understand its context and ensure that a potential division by zero is addressed.

Let's start by searching for the `_sparse_fit` method in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("_sparse_fit")
```

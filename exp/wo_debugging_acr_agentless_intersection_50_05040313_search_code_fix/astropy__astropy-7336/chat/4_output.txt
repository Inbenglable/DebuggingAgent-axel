To address this issue, I need to examine the relevant portion of the code in the `astropy` project related to the `quantity_input` decorator. This decorator is likely implemented in the `decorators.py` file based on the traceback provided.

I'll start by locating the relevant method for `quantity_input` in the `astropy/units/decorators.py` file. 

```python
search_method_in_codebase("quantity_input")
```
Once identified, the precise code block causing the issue, specifically dealing with return type handling, will be targeted for resolution.

Now You need to reolve the following issue in the **sympy** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
kernS: 'kern' referenced before assignment
from sympy.core.sympify import kernS

text = "(2*x)/(x-1)"
expr = kernS(text)  
//  hit = kern in s
// UnboundLocalError: local variable 'kern' referenced before assignment

</ISSUE>


You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue with the `kernS` function from `sympy.core.sympify`, I would first need to gather the source code of the `kernS` function, as the error indicates there is a variable `kern` that is referenced before assignment within this function. Since the file path is provided as `sympy/core/sympify.py`, I will search for the `kernS` method in this file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/core/sympify.py", "kernS")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_file("sympy/core/sympify.py", "kernS")
RESULT:
#### sympy/core/sympify.py:kernS
```python
def kernS(s):
    """Use a hack to try keep autosimplification from distributing a
    a number into an Add; this modification doesn't
    prevent the 2-arg Mul from becoming an Add, however.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.core.sympify import kernS
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y

    The 2-arg Mul distributes a number (or minus sign) across the terms
    of an expression, but kernS will prevent that:

    >>> 2*(x + y), -(x + 1)
    (2*x + 2*y, -x - 1)
    >>> kernS('2*(x + y)')
    2*(x + y)
    >>> kernS('-(x + 1)')
    -(x + 1)

    If use of the hack fails, the un-hacked string will be passed to sympify...
    and you get what you get.

    XXX This hack should not be necessary once issue 4596 has been resolved.

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

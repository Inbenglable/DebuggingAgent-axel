To resolve the issue at hand, we need the implementation details from the relevant parts of the codebase, specifically focusing on the `bar` method in the `Axes` class and the `_safe_first_finite` function in the `cbook` module that are referenced in the traceback.

Here is the analysis of the API returned content:

1. `lib/mpl_toolkits/axes_grid1/mpl_axes.py:Axes`: This appears to be a subclass of another `Axes` class, unrelated to the `Axes` class implementation in `matplotlib/axes/_axes.py`.

2. `lib/mpl_toolkits/axisartist/axislines.py:Axes`: Similar to the previous entry, this is another subclass and is not directly related to the `Axes` class implementation in `matplotlib/axes/_axes.py`.

3. `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py:Axes`: This file contains the actual `Axes` class from the core `matplotlib` library. Relevant methods including `_convert_dx` and `bar` methods are present in this implementation, making this content highly relevant.

From the above, the content needed for investigation is:

```
lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py:Axes
```

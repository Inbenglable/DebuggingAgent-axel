The API search results have repeatedly returned the same structure of the class `Paginator`, indicating that I have gathered all I need to know about the class to generate the patch. The outline of the class includes all necessary identifiers to locate where to place the `__iter__` method. There is no need to search for additional details about the methods or properties, as the `__iter__` method can be added based on the provided structure.

Hence, I'm ready to generate the patch:

Ready generation: `True`

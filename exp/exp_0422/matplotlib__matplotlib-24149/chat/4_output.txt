Analyzing the reported issue, the abnormal behavior occurs when calling `ax.bar([np.nan], [np.nan])`, which raises a `StopIteration` exception. The traceback indicates that the issue stems from the method `_safe_first_finite` in `matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py`.

The exception is triggered because `_safe_first_finite` uses a generator expression to find the first finite number in a sequence. Since the sequence contains only NaN values, the generator expression exhausts all items without finding a finite value, leading to the `StopIteration` exception.

The bug likely resides in the logic of `_safe_first_finite` when handling sequences that contain only NaN values.

Buggy method: `matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py:_safe_first_finite`

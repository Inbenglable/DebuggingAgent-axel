I need to retrieve the source code for the `timesince` method in order to understand the current implementation and make the necessary modifications to handle timezone-aware datetime objects correctly. I'll start by searching for the `timesince` method in the Django codebase, as I don't have the specific file path information.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("timesince")
```

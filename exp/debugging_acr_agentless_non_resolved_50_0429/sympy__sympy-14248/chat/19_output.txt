To determine if the issue is resolved, let's break down the information given and evaluate the patch and its effects on the test output.  

### Patch Review  
The patch modifies the `sympy/printing/str.py` by changing how terms are printed:  
- The original code would determine the sign and print each term by checking whether the printed term starts with a '-' character.  
- The patched code introduces additional checks for terms that are multiplications with the first argument as `S.NegativeOne`, and changes how signs are determined for the first term in the expression.  

This change is intended to ensure that expressions of the form `a-b` are printed with a '-' sign instead of using a negative coefficient.

### Test Output Analysis  
**Original Output:**  
- The test failure indicates that the `str` representation of the expression `A - A*B - B` was printed incorrectly as `'(-1)*B + (-1)*A*B + A'`.

**Patched Output:**  
- The patched output shows the same test failure: `Expected 'A - A*B - B' but got '(-1)*B + (-1)*A*B + A'`.

Both outputs before and after the patch reveal that the issue persists, as the expected outputs do not match the actual outputs produced by the program.

### Conclusion  
After applying the patch, the behavior of the program did not change in the context of the test provided. The expected output for the `str` representation of the matrix symbols difference remains incorrect, showing that the patch did not resolve the issue as intended.

Issue resolved: `False`

To address this issue, the main task involves modifying the equality comparison (`__eq__`) for Django model fields so that fields from different models don't compare as equal. This requires understanding the current implementation of `__eq__` and possibly `__hash__` and `__lt__` methods of the field classes in Django. The field classes are typically defined in `django.db.models.fields`.

I need to retrieve the code for these methods for the field class in Django to proceed with making the necessary adjustments for this patch.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("Field.__eq__")
search_method_in_codebase("Field.__hash__")
search_method_in_codebase("Field.__lt__")
```

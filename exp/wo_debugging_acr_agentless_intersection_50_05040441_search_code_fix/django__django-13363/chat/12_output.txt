Upon reviewing the test output before and after the patch application, both output logs display the same error: `django.db.utils.OperationalError: no such table: __main___timeslots`. This indicates that the test is unable to proceed because the required database table is missing.

The failure to create the necessary table (`__main___timeslots`) is the root cause of the error and not the intended logic of the `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` functions. The issue with the `tzinfo` parameter in the `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` functions was meant to be fixed in the patch, but the test cannot reach the point to accurately verify this due to the operational error.

Hence, we cannot determine if the logical issue about `tzinfo` is resolved based on the test outputs.

Issue resolved: `False`

Upon reviewing the provided information, it appears that the reported issue relates to the `order_by('?')` functionality in Django, which was causing the queryset aggregation to break unexpectedly. The patch proposed changes the SQL compiler's behavior to ignore `Random` expressions when building the `GROUP BY` clause to resolve this.

However, the test outputs, both original and patched, indicate a traceback error related to the Django app registry: "Apps aren't loaded yet." This error implies a setup issue with the Django test environment, not directly related to the bug or the proposed patch.

The test code should be adjusted to properly initialize the Django test environment. This involves ensuring that the Django application registry is correctly set up and the test is executed using Django's testing frameworks, which manage application state, including migrations and app registrations.

Thus, due to the failure in the test setup, the test is not actually verifying whether the underlying issue (aggregation broken by `Random` ordering) is resolved by the patch.

Given these considerations, the effectiveness of the patch on the reported issue cannot be confirmed given the current test setup and output.

Therefore, the issue is resolved: `False`

To address the issue, I need to locate and inspect the `trim_docstring` function to understand its current implementation. This will allow me to make the necessary modification to skip the first line when calculating indentation.

Since the issue description doesn't specify the file where `trim_docstring` is defined, I will search for this method in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("trim_docstring")
```

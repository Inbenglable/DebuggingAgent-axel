To address the issue, the first step is to extend the merge capability of the `ds.merge()` method to accept a `DataArray` object. As of now, the `merge` method in `xarray/core/dataset.py` is designed to work with datasets or variables castable to datasets. To proceed with crafting a patch, I'll first inspect the `dataset_merge_method` defined in `xarray/core/merge.py`, as this function is directly involved in the `merge` implementation.

I will search for the `dataset_merge_method` in the `xarray/core/merge.py` file to further understand its current implementation.

```python
search_method_in_file("xarray/core/merge.py", "dataset_merge_method")
```

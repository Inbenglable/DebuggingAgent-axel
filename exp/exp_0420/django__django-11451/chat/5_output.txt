I need to inspect the `authenticate` method in the `ModelBackend` class to review its current implementation and confirm or adjust the behavior as described in the issue. Since I don't have the file path, I'll start by searching for the method in the codebase:

```python
search_method_in_codebase("ModelBackend.authenticate")
```

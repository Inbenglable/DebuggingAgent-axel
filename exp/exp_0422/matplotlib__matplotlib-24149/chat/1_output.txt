To generate a minimal debugging test for the reported issue, I'll simplify the reproduction code to focus on the problem area regarding `ax.bar` when both `x` and `height` are set to `np.nan`. This will allow us to directly observe and analyze any errors raised by the function under these specific conditions:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Minimal debugging test
f, ax = plt.subplots()
# Test with both x and height as NaN to reproduce error
ax.bar([np.nan], [np.nan])
```

Now, let's format this in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
  "debugging_test": "import numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nf, ax = plt.subplots()\n# Test with both x and height as NaN to reproduce error\nax.bar([np.nan], [np.nan])"
}
```

This code will help us focus on the specific error without additional complexity, making it easier to diagnose and fix the problem.

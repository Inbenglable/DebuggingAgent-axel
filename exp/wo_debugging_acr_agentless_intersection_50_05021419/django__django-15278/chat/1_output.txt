To address this issue, we need to understand how Django handles adding fields, particularly `OneToOneField`, during migrations when using SQLite. The error arises due to the alteration of a table to add a column that combines a `NULL` value and a `UNIQUE` constraint, which SQLite does not directly support.

In order to form a proper patch, I need to gather source code relevant to how Django handles database schema changes, particularly for SQLite. This likely involves searching for Django's operations related to altering models during migrations. Specifically, I will search for the operation where Django adds a field to a table and its SQLite-specific handling.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("AddField.database_forwards")
search_code_in_codebase("ALTER TABLE")
search_method_in_codebase("sqlite3.DatabaseSchemaEditor")
```

By exploring `AddField.database_forwards`, I'll understand how Django processes the addition of fields during migrations. By checking for any handling related to the `ALTER TABLE` SQL command, I can see if there are specific paths where this command is modified or controlled. Additionally, retrieving information on `sqlite3.DatabaseSchemaEditor` will provide insight into any SQLite-specific adjustments made during these schema changes.

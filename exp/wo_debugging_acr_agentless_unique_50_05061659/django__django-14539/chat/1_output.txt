The issue is related to the `urlize` function in the Django project. To fix the bug, I need to inspect the source code of the `urlize` function to understand how it processes the input string, particularly regarding HTML escaped strings and the trailing punctuation.

Therefore, I will search for the `urlize` method in the Django project codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("urlize")
```

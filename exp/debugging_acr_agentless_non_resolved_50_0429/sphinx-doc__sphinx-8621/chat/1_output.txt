Given the provided issue description, the `:kbd:` role appears to incorrectly treat certain characters as separators when used in standalone or compound keystrokes, resulting in the generation of incorrect HTML.

The main area of interest is the handling of the `:kbd:` role within the Sphinx codebase, specifically how its output is generated. This typically involves interactions with the `docutils` library or internal Sphinx methods that generate HTML for roles. We need to trace the handling of the `:kbd:` role.

Given the structure and functioning of Sphinx, the `HTMLTranslator` class in `sphinx/writers/html.py` is a good starting point, as it might hold responsibilities for translating specific document elements into HTML, including roles like `:kbd:`. The next method to observe would be any method within `HTMLTranslator` that handles roles and their conversion to HTML.

Observed method: `sphinx/writers/html.py:HTMLTranslator.visit_literal_role`

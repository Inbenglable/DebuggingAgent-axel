To fix the bug concerning the index entry with parentheses for the `py:method` directive with the `:property:` option in Sphinx, we need to focus on the specific implementation that processes Python-specific constructs within Sphinx. Among the search results for `handle_signature`, we're primarily interested in the part of the Sphinx code that manages Python domain directive handling, particularly `py:method`. This functionality is most likely located in the Python domain section of the project.

Based on the results, the relevant file handling this part is likely in `sphinx/domains/python.py`. Therefore, we should focus on analyzing and potentially modifying the method related to directive processing in the Python domain.

The potential method to analyze is:
- `PyDecoratorMixin.handle_signature`: Located in `sphinx/domains/python.py`, it handles the signature for decorators. However, it may not directly relate to `py:method` with `:property:`, unless this mixin affects how properties are visualized in documentation.

Given this analysis, the relevant entry is:

```
sphinx/domains/python.py:PyDecoratorMixin.handle_signature
```

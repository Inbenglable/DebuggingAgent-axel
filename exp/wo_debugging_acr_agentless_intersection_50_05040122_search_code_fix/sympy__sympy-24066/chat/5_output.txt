Here is the proposed patch in the SEARCH/REPLACE format to address the issue in `_collect_factor_and_dimension` for properly handling dimensionless exponents within function expressions.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            return (expr.func(*(f[0] for f in fds)),\n                    *(d[1] for d in fds))\n=======\n            dim_args = [d[1] for d in fds]\n            # Check if all arguments are dimensionless\n            if all(self.get_dimension_system().is_dimensionless(dim) for dim in dim_args):\n                return expr.func(*(f[0] for f in fds)), Dimension(1)\n            return (expr.func(*(f[0] for f in fds)), *dim_args)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch modifies the handling of function expressions in `_collect_factor_and_dimension` to check if all function arguments are dimensionless and then returns a dimension of `Dimension(1)` if they are. This should fix the issue where expressions like `exp(expr)` are not being recognized as dimensionless when they should be.

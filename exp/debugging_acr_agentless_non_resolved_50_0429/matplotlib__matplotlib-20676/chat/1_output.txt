Based on the provided information, the bug stems from the behavior of the `SpanSelector` widget in Matplotlib, which causes the axes limits to improperly expand to include 0 when the `interactive` mode is enabled. This behavior mimics the older `span_stays` functionality but does not maintain the axis limits as expected.

The test script attempts to compare the x-limits of the axes before and after the `SpanSelector` widget is used. The x-limits initially are `(9.5, 20.5)`, but after the interaction, they change to `(-1.0000000000000009, 21.0)`. This indicates a problem with how the `SpanSelector` interacts with the axes.

Given the details from the test and error message, the next logical step is to investigate the initialization and any methods within the `SpanSelector` class that pertain to axis limit modifications.

Observed method: `lib/matplotlib/widgets.py:SpanSelector.__init__`

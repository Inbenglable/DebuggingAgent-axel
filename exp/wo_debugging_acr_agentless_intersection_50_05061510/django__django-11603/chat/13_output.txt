**Review of the Patch and Analysis of Test Output:**

1. **Patch Context Analysis:**
   - The patch attempts to allow the `Avg`, `Sum`, `Min`, and `Max` aggregates to accept the `distinct` keyword by setting the `allow_distinct` attribute to `True` within each of their respective class definitions in `django/db/models/aggregates.py`.

2. **Test Output Analysis (Before and After the Patch):**
   - **Original Output:** The error encountered is `django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady`, indicating an issue with the Django application not being fully initialized before the test model was defined.
   - **Patched Output:** The test output remains unchanged, presenting the same `AppRegistryNotReady` error, indicating that the patch did not address the initialization problem leading to error generation in the testing setup.

**Conclusion:**
The patch addresses a distinct issue regarding aggregate operations and their SQL generation but does not affect the reproducibility of the error shown in the test outputs. The actual error seems to be unrelated to the aggregates' functionality and instead points to a problem with the test setup/configuration, thus remaining unchanged before and after applying the patch.

**Issue resolved:** `False`

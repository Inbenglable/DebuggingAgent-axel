The issue is with the code generation in the `codegen` part of the SymPy library. Specifically, the incorrect function signature is generated when using the cython backend with `autowrap`. To resolve this issue, I need to inspect the source code of the `codegen` module to understand how the function signature is being generated and where the transformation of argument types occurs.

I need to retrieve the source code related to the `autowrap` function and then delve into the `codegen` logic that handles the generation of these C function signatures. It's likely that these are located in the `sympy/utilities/autowrap.py` file and potentially in `sympy/utilities/codegen.py`.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/utilities/autowrap.py", "autowrap")
search_method_in_codebase("codegen")
```

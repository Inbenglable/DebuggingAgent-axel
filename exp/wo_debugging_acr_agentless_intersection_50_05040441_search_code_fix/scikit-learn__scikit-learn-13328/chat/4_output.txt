### Review of the Patch

The patch modifies the `HuberRegressor.fit` method in `sklearn/linear_model/huber.py`. The change introduces a check for the data type of the input array `X`. If `X` is a boolean array, it converts the array to float using `X.astype(float)`. This conversion ensures compatibility similar to other linear models like `LinearRegression`, which can handle boolean arrays by internally converting them to floats.

### Analysis of Test Outputs

#### Original Output (Before Patch)

The original output demonstrates that when fitting the `HuberRegressor` with boolean predictors (`X_bool`), a `TypeError` was raised. The error message indicates an unsupported operation on boolean arrays, specifically the use of the unary `-` operator, which is not valid for boolean arrays.

#### Patched Output (After Patch)

After applying the patch, the test indicates that the issue is fixed, as demonstrated by the message `"Issue is fixed."`, and the absence of errors or exceptions. This implies that `HuberRegressor` can now successfully fit using boolean predictors without raising a `TypeError`.

### Conclusion

The patch effectively resolves the issue by converting boolean arrays to floats before processing, aligning the behavior of `HuberRegressor.fit` with expected functionality concerning input handling.

**Issue resolved: `True`**

The issue described in the bug report is related to the `QuerySet.only()` method crashing when used after `select_related()` with proxy models in Django. The patch adjusts the problematic line in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` to access the meta information from the concrete model, which seems to align with the suggested solution in the issue description.

The test provided is designed to reproduce the problem, and its original output indicates a lack of setup with a `ModuleNotFoundError` for 'your_project'. This means the test could not be executed correctly due to an environment setup issue, not necessarily related to the bug itself.

The patched output shows the same module not found error without any indication of a change in behavior due to the patch. The errors in both the original and patched outputs don't relate directly to the original bug issue but rather to an environment setup issue.

As both outputs are identical and are issues with the environment setup, not with executing the change, we cannot determine from the outputs alone if the patch resolves the issue. A properly set up environment is necessary to test whether the patch effectively resolves the original bug.

Therefore, without a successful run of the test case, we are unable to confirm if the issue is resolved based on the information presented.

Issue resolved: `False`

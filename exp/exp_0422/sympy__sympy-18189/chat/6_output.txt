I have the source code for the `diophantine` method available. It appears that I can generate a patch to resolve the issue where the order of symbols (`syms`) affects the results with `permute=True`. The `diophantine` function uses a permutation logic that may be inconsistent depending on the input symbols' order, likely due to earlier checks or modifications that alter the variable mapping.

Ready generation: `True`

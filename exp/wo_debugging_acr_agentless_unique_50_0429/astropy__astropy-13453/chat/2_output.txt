To address the issue, I need to understand more about how HTML output is generated and how the `formats` option is processed in the Astropy project. This might involve looking into the implementation of the `write()` function and the part where HTML-specific writing occurs, especially if there's a Writer class or method responsible for HTML output.

Since the `search_method_in_codebase("write_html")` didn't return anything directly relevant, there's a possibility that HTML writing is a part of the generic `write` process but implemented in a specific HTML-related Writer class.

To proceed, I'll need to search for any HTML-related writer classes or methods. 

```python
search_class_in_codebase("HTMLWriter")
search_method_in_codebase("get_writer")
search_class_in_codebase("TableOutputWriter")
```

These searches aim to find the HTML writer class assuming a generic pattern for class names in the codebase, or any table writer that might handle different formats including HTML. Additionally, I want to understand how writer instances are obtained, which could offer insight into format-specific handling.

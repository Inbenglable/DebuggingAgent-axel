Based on the analysis of the provided information:

1. **Review of the Patch:**
   - The patch attempts to address the issue by ensuring consistent random state behavior and restoring the state of the input data `X` for consistency across different numbers of jobs.
   - However, the changes made in the search/replace sections do not seem to address the core issue related to numerical differences in inertia when changing the number of jobs. The adjustments are aimed at maintaining consistency in data handling but may not directly resolve the numerical precision differences.

2. **Test Output Before and After the Patch:**
   - Both before and after applying the patch, the test results in an `AssertionError` due to an inertia mismatch between the single-job and multi-job runs.
   - The output values remain the same: `n_jobs=1: 17815.004991244623, n_jobs=2: 17815.060435554242`.

Given the above points, the patch does not succeed in resolving the inconsistency issue, as the output after patching remains unchanged and still exhibits the mismatched inertia values.

Issue resolved: `False`

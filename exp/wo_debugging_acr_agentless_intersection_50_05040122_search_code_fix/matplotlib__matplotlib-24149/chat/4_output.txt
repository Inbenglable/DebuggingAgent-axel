To resolve the issue of `ax.bar` raising an exception when passed only NaN data in Matplotlib 3.6.1, we need to modify the `_convert_dx` method to handle NaN values appropriately. The traceback indicates an issue with `_safe_first_finite` when provided data containing only NaN values.

Given the source code, the fix would involve ensuring `_safe_first_finite` can handle NaN inputs gracefully without raising errors. We need to change the logic to default to conversion directly for NaN values in the `x0` array.

Here's the patch to fix this:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ntry:\n    x0 = cbook._safe_first_finite(x0)\n=======\ntry:\n    x0 = cbook._safe_first_finite(x0)\n    if np.isnan(x0):\n        raise ValueError()\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch will handle cases where `x0` contains only NaN values and ensure that `cbook._safe_first_finite` doesn't cause a `StopIteration` by forcing a fallback to conversion.

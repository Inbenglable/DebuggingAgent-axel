The observed issue is occurring due to the `units.quantity_input` decorator trying to perform unit conversion on the `return_annotation` of the function, which is `None` for a constructor (`__init__` method). This is leading to an `AttributeError` because `None` does not have a method `to`.

From the traceback, it is evident that the issue occurs in the method where the decorator processes the function, specifically inside the method where the return value or its equivalent is being handled or expected to perform conversion.

Given the information, the issue manifests in the following decorator logic:

Buggy method: `astropy/units/decorators.py:wrapper`

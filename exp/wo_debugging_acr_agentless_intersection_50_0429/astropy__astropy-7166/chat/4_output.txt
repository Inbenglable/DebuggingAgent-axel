To address the issue with properties in the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass, the patch needs to handle properties separately apart from regular methods/functions. Since I have enough information about how the class is currently doing things with `inspect.isfunction`, and since the current focus is on adjusting to work with properties, no further source code retrieval is required before making changes to the logic.

Ready generation: `True`

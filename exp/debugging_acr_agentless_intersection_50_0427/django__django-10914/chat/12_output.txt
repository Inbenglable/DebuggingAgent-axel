The initial issue was that file permissions were inconsistently set to `0o600` instead of the desired `0o644`. The bug was observed when files were uploaded using different handlers, resulting in inconsistent permissions due to how the `tempfile` module handles temporary files.

### Patch Review

The patch modifies the `_save` method in `django/core/files/storage.py` to ensure that files have consistent permissions of `0o644`. If `self.file_permissions_mode` is not explicitly set, the patch sets the permissions to `0o644` after saving the file.

### Test Output Analysis

**Original Output:**

- The test failed with an `AssertionError` due to file permissions being set to `0o600` instead of the expected `0o644`.
  
**Patched Output:**

- The test passes successfully, confirming that file permissions are now consistently set to `0o644` as expected.

After reviewing the patch and comparing test outputs, the provided patch resolves the issue of inconsistent file permissions for uploaded files by ensuring they default to `0o644`.

Issue resolved: `True`

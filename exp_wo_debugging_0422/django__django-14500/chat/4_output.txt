In order to generate the patch, I need to understand the `recorder` attribute in the `MigrationExecutor` class and its related logic for marking migrations as unapplied. Since I've already obtained the `record_unapplied` method from the `Recorder` class, I now need to retrieve the code for the `Recorder` class itself to understand its implementation and usage better.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/migrations/recorder.py", "Recorder")
```

To generate the patch, I need the `__eq__` method implementation for the `BooleanFalse` class in the `sympy/logic/boolalg.py` file. This is crucial to handle the specific case for comparison with `S(0.0)`. I will need to fetch it before proceeding.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/logic/boolalg.py", "BooleanFalse.__eq__")
```

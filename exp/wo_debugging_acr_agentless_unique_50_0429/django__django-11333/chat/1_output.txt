To resolve the issue, the first step is to examine the implementation of the `get_resolver` method and related classes or methods to understand how the URL resolvers are being instantiated and cached. Since the issue specifically mentions `get_resolver`, `set_urlconf`, and the class `URLResolver`, I'll need to locate and review the code for these components. 

I'll start by searching for the `get_resolver` method in the `django.urls.resolvers` file, as this is the primary function of interest. I'll also look into the `URLResolver` class to check how `_populate` function is used. Lastly, I'll check the `set_urlconf` method to understand its role in modifying the URL configuration caching behavior.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/urls/resolvers.py", "get_resolver")
search_class_in_file("django/urls/resolvers.py", "URLResolver")
search_method_in_file("django/urls/base.py", "set_urlconf")
```

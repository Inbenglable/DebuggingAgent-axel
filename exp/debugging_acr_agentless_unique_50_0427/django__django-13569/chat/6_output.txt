To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code of the `get_group_by` method from the `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` file, as this method seems to be involved in constructing the problematic `GROUP BY` clause when using `order_by('?')`.

I'll proceed by searching for the `get_group_by` method in the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/sql/compiler.py", "get_group_by")
```

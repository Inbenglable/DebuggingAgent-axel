I need to retrieve the source code for the `post_process` method in the `post_process` function in the `django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py` file where the issue is reported. This will help in understanding how to handle the `substitutions` variable when `max_post_process_passes` is set to `0`.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py", "post_process")
```

The issue seems to be that the `MigrationOptimizer` is not effectively reducing multiple `AlterField` operations into a single operation when they relate to the same field. From the trace and information provided, the `optimize_inner` method is supposed to handle this optimization process.

The key part of the code is where it attempts to reduce consecutive migration operations using the `reduce` method, located at line 47 in `optimize_inner`. For consecutive `AlterField` operations on the same field, the `reduce` method should potentially return a single `AlterField` operation that reflects the cumulative changes. However, in the runtime information provided, we can see that `result` is `False` on line 47, indicating that the `reduce` method does not currently support reducing consecutive `AlterField` operations.

The problematic behavior stems from the current implementation of how `AlterField` operations get reduced, which is determined by the `reduce` method of those operations. Since the `optimize_inner` method delegates this responsibility to each operation's `reduce` method, the suspect area is likely the `AlterField.reduce` method.

Buggy method: `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py:AlterField.reduce`

To analyze the current behavior, we need to consider how the `separability_matrix` function processes nested compound models, which is the main issue here. Nested compound models seem to be evaluated differently, leading to the expected diagonal separability matrix not being observed.

Given the provided information, we observe the following behavior:

1. When creating a simple compound model, the separability matrix is as expected.
2. For more complex models involving multiple model components (like a transformation and linear models), the separability matrix also seems correctly calculated initially.
3. The issue arises when these models are nested. The nested compound model shows a separability matrix that indicates a lack of separability which does not align with expected behavior given the components.

The current separability matrix output for the nested model indicates that the inputs and outputs of the nested components are not being assessed individually correctly when part of a nested structure.

From the test runtime information, we can see that the `separability_matrix` computation relies heavily on the `_separable` function inside it, which is possibly responsible for computing individual model separability.

In order to trace the abnormal program behavior step by step, and since the trace indicates that the separability matrix is fully computed in `separability_matrix`, we need to further investigate how `_separable` aggregates or transforms these results for nested models.

Thus, the next step is to observe the `_separable` function to understand how the computation is concluded and if it correctly considers nested compound models.

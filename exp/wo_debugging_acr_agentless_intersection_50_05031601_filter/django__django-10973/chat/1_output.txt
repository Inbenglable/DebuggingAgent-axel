To resolve the issue, we need to make changes in the `django.db.backends.postgres.client` module, specifically in the code where a subprocess is invoked to interact with the PostgreSQL client. We need to use `subprocess.run` and pass the `PGPASSWORD` in the environment.

First, I'll locate and retrieve the source code for the method responsible for invoking the subprocess in the PostgreSQL backend client of Django. This will allow me to analyze how it sets the environment and makes the subprocess call.

Let's search for this method in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("client")
```

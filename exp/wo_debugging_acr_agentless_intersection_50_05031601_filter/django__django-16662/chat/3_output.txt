To resolve the issue, I need to identify the parts of the Django source code responsible for generating migrations and specifically the logic handling imports in the migration files. Let's analyze the API returned content:

1. `tests/gis_tests/gis_migrations/test_operations.py:4-10`: This is a test file related to geographic information system (GIS) migration operations. It is not directly related to migration generation logic but rather tests existing operations.

2. `tests/migrations/test_operations.py:1-6`: Another test file, which seems to test migration operations. It's not directly involved in the migration generation process.

3. `tests/migrations/test_base.py:6-12`: Also a test file related to migrations testing. It does not participate in the generation of migrations.

4. `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py:7-13`: This file is related to the automatic detection of migrations, and might be involved in the migration creation process. However, it doesn't specifically mention anything about handling import ordering.

5. `django/db/migrations/__init__.py:1-2`: Initialization file for the migrations module, likely not involved directly in the generation or import ordering.

6. `django/core/management/commands/squashmigrations.py:7-13`: This file relates to the command for squashing migrations, a process that might involve regeneration but is more about consolidating existing migrations.

7. `django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py:11-17`: This is potentially relevant as `makemigrations` is the command used for creating migration files. This file likely contains the logic for generating migrations and is where import order may be arranged.

Based on the above analysis, the most relevant content related to the migration generation and potential handling of import order is:

```
django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py:11-17
```

Other entries are related to testing, initialization, or different aspects of migration handling that don't directly involve altering the import order in migration files.

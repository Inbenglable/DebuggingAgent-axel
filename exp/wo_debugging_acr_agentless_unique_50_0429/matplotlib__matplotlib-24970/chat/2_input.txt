[Bug]: NumPy 1.24 deprecation warnings
### Bug summary

Starting NumPy 1.24 I observe several deprecation warnings.


### Code for reproduction

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

plt.get_cmap()(np.empty((0, ), dtype=np.uint8))
```


### Actual outcome

```
/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/matplotlib/colors.py:730: DeprecationWarning: NumPy will stop allowing conversion of out-of-bound Python integers to integer arrays.  The conversion of 257 to uint8 will fail in the future.
For the old behavior, usually:
    np.array(value).astype(dtype)`
will give the desired result (the cast overflows).
  xa[xa > self.N - 1] = self._i_over
/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/matplotlib/colors.py:731: DeprecationWarning: NumPy will stop allowing conversion of out-of-bound Python integers to integer arrays.  The conversion of 256 to uint8 will fail in the future.
For the old behavior, usually:
    np.array(value).astype(dtype)`
will give the desired result (the cast overflows).
  xa[xa < 0] = self._i_under
/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/matplotlib/colors.py:732: DeprecationWarning: NumPy will stop allowing conversion of out-of-bound Python integers to integer arrays.  The conversion of 258 to uint8 will fail in the future.
For the old behavior, usually:
    np.array(value).astype(dtype)`
will give the desired result (the cast overflows).
  xa[mask_bad] = self._i_bad
```

### Expected outcome

### Installation

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To address the deprecation warnings, it's important to examine the context of the lines in the `matplotlib/colors.py` file where the issue arises. Therefore, we need to retrieve the specific context or method enclosing these lines (line 730, 731, and 732) to understand the logic and how to apply the fix appropriately.

I'll first retrieve the method or surrounding code in the `matplotlib/colors.py` file involving these lines.

```python
search_code_in_file("lib/matplotlib/colors.py", "xa[xa > self.N - 1] = self._i_over")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_code_in_file("lib/matplotlib/colors.py", "xa[xa > self.N - 1] = self._i_over")
RESULT:
#### lib/matplotlib/colors.py:727-733
```python
                xa = xa.astype(int)
        # Set the over-range indices before the under-range;
        # otherwise the under-range values get converted to over-range.
        xa[xa > self.N - 1] = self._i_over
        xa[xa < 0] = self._i_under
        xa[mask_bad] = self._i_bad

```


==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

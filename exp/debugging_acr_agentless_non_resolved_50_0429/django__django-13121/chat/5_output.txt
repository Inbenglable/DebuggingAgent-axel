To resolve this issue, I need to understand the context in which the annotated queryset gets its results and how these results are processed through the convert_durationfield_value method. Given that we've identified the point of failure and retrieved its implementation, I'll also need to understand how duration expressions are handled in SQLite and MySQL.

Let's investigate how annotated queryset results are processed. Observing the method `QuerySet._fetch_all` in `django/db/models/query.py`, as originally noted in the debugging information, will be useful.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/query.py", "QuerySet._fetch_all")
```

Additionally, I'll check how DurationField expressions are managed in SQLite and MySQL, as the failure is specific to these databases.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py", "SQLiteDatabaseOperations.definitions")
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/mysql/base.py", "MySQLDatabaseOperations.definitions")
```

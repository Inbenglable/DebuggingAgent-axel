## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Meta.ordering fields must not be included in GROUP BY clause
Description
	
This continues (closed) [1] ticket.
I beleave it was not properly fixed in commit [0ddb4ebf].
While commit [0ddb4ebf] removes ORDER BY when Meta.ordering is used it still does populates GROUP BY with Meta.ordering fields thus leads to wrong aggregation.
PR with test case was added at [2].

</ISSUE>


A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
Based on the test, it seems there is an issue with the SQL query's `GROUP BY` clause. The problem is related to the fields defined in `Meta.ordering` being included in the `GROUP BY` clause when they shouldn't be. 

Now, given the error mentioned initially, the observed behavior seems to be tied to query construction inside the Django ORM. It's likely in the SQL generation for `GROUP BY` clauses. The Django code segment handling this might incorrectly include fields specified in `Meta.ordering`.

Examining how queries are handled in Django, the code that constructs SQL queries for aggregation, including `GROUP BY`, usually resides in query classes like `Query` or `SQLCompiler`.

To further trace why `Meta.ordering` fields are incorrectly included in the `GROUP BY`, we need to observe the method responsible for assembling the SQL `GROUP BY` statement:

Observed method: `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py:SQLCompiler.get_group_by`
==================================================
The observed code in the `SQLCompiler.get_group_by` method is responsible for constructing the `GROUP BY` clause in SQL queries. The logic attempts to ensure that the `GROUP BY` clause includes the necessary columns based on the query context, such as selected fields, ordering, and having filters.

From the description of the issue, it seems that fields specified in the `Meta.ordering` attribute are incorrectly being added to the `GROUP BY` clause when they shouldn't be. This could lead to erroneous results in queries that use aggregation.

In the current runtime trace, it appears that there may not have been an instance where `order_by` is non-empty or `self.query.group_by` triggers the more complex logic beyond line 101, as all current traces return early for queries without `group_by` or `order_by`. It is likely necessary to delve deeper into how `order_by` is constructed and manage its usage in `get_group_by`.

The next step involves examining in more detail how the method behaves when fields from `Meta.ordering` are indeed expected to be added to `order_by`, potentially exploring sections where `order_by` factors into `GROUP BY`.

Let's dive deeper into understanding how fields in `Meta.ordering` potentially add to `order_by` by examining the broader scope from lines 128 to 133, which look at `order_by` and its impact:

```plaintext
Observed scope: django/db/models/sql/compiler.py:128-133
```
==================================================
The current observed code snippet from `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py:SQLCompiler.get_group_by` details a segment involved in assembling the `GROUP BY` clause. Specifically, it processes the `order_by` list to determine which expressions should be included in `GROUP BY`. The loop iterates over `order_by`, skipping references to the select clause (as these are implicitly grouped), and collects grouping columns for other expressions using `expr.get_group_by_cols()`.

The runtime error provided is related to the test environment setup, indicating an attempt to call `setup_test_environment()` without properly tearing down a previous test environment. This does not directly relate to SQL query construction but shows that there might have been improper cleanup between test runs. The actual SQL issue under investigation pertains to mismanagement in how fields specified in `Meta.ordering` affect the `GROUP BY` clause.

Given that the problem lies within the SQL construction process, particularly with how ordering fields inadvertently affect `GROUP BY`, and observing the segment from `get_group_by` dealing with these constructs, exploration towards other parts of SQL construction for additional insights can be effective.

Current strategy indicates further analysis of how SQLCompiler handles ordering logic in conjunction with GROUP BY creation is critical to identify where the ordering fields are improperly carried into the group by construction. 

Let's continue observing the surrounding methods particularly linked to query structure management or field inclusion logic. An adjacent method that could clarify or expand how fields are handled would be sought.

Observed method: `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py:SQLCompiler.get_order_by`
==================================================
The runtime information and the analysis of the `SQLCompiler.get_order_by` method provide insights into how the method constructs an ordering clause based on query attributes. Specifically, the method processes fields specified in the `ordering` list. The observations indicate that the method fetches ordering conditions correctly from `meta.ordering` when other ordering attributes (like `extra_order_by`, and `order_by`) are not present. The orderings are then resolved to SQL expressions. The absence of fields in the order_by processing suggests an issue with filtering or inclusion before they reach `get_order_by`. 

The root cause of the issue is likely linked to the fact highlighted in the issue description: fields in `meta.ordering` are included in `GROUP BY` when they shouldn't be. It looks like the code path improperly relates the order_by condition to the grouping clauses in the SQL statement, potentially tied to the decision points based on the query state before `get_group_by` is invoked.

To dive deeper into understanding why fields from `meta.ordering` are incorporated into the `GROUP BY` clause, it will be helpful to trace upstream or lateral logic affecting how `order_by` is eventually transferred to a `group_by` scenario. The focus should perhaps now shift towards the behavior within the `get_group_by` method or any linking logic.

Let's examine how the `order_by` affects `GROUP BY` inside the compiler or related logic within `SQLCompiler`. I would like to explore a method that involves logic directly impacting field transmission between ordering and grouping.

Observed scope: `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py:SQLCompiler.get_group_by` for further examination of how it processes when ordering should not affect the group clause. 

```plaintext
Observed scope: django/db/models/sql/compiler.py:100-150
```
==================================================
The current runtime information indicates that there is an error related to improper handling of the test environment setup and teardown, which might need addressing separately for ensuring clean test execution. However, this does not directly relate to the SQL construction problem at hand.

Examining the code within the `SQLCompiler.get_group_by` method, it is apparent that the inclusion of fields in the `GROUP BY` clause considers expressions from `order_by`, among others. The significant lines are from 128 to 133, where `for expr, (sql, params, is_ref) in order_by:` indicates that it could include fields from the ordering clause, even when they correspond to `Meta.ordering`, potentially leading to the issue observed during runtime.

Given the error description provided initially, it seems essential to ensure that fields from `Meta.ordering` do not improperly influence the grouping scenario. This understanding points strongly to `get_group_by` as the method where ordering fields are mistakenly included in the `GROUP BY` clause.

Analyzing the current state of the code and the bug pattern, the method responsible for faulty behavior regarding order inclusion in the `GROUP BY` clause has likely been identified.

Buggy method: `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py:SQLCompiler.get_group_by`
==================================================


Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

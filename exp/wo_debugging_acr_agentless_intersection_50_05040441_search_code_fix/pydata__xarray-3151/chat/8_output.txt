The issue involves the `combine_by_coords` function in the xarray library, which raises a `ValueError` when attempting to combine datasets with identical, non-monotonic coordinates. This behavior contradicts the documented expectation that non-varying coordinate dimensions should be ignored during combination.

### Review of the Patch:
The patch modifies the part of the code in `xarray/core/combine.py` where a monotonicity check is performed. It introduces a condition to check if the dimension varies between datasets. This is done by iterating through each dataset and checking if the coordinate of each dataset is not equal to the combined coordinate. The monotonicity check—and consequently the `ValueError`—is only applied if the coordinate varies.

### Analysis of Outputs:
- **Original Output**: The reported `ValueError` shows that the function disagrees with the documentation, stopping execution due to non-monotonic coordinates that are consistent across datasets.

- **Patched Output**: The output confirms that the function completes without error, indicating that the patch has bypassed the monotonicity check for non-varying coordinates, aligning behavior with the documented expectation. It prints "Issue is fixed. Exiting with code 0."

### Conclusion:
The patch effectively prevents the `ValueError` from being raised when combining by coordinates that do not vary, thus adhering to the documented behavior. The test output confirms that the problem is resolved, as the code runs without issue after the patch is applied.

Issue resolved: `True`

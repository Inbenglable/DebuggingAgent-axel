Based on the issue description and the retrieved implementation of the `Field.__hash__()` method, it appears that the hash function depends primarily on the `creation_counter`, `app_label`, and `model_name`. The state of the `model` attribute can potentially change after a `Field` is assigned to a `Model`, altering the `__hash__`. This behavior is inconsistent with how hash functions should work, as the hash value of an object should remain constant during the lifecycle of the object.

To resolve this issue, the hash should not depend on mutable elements. The correct approach might involve reverting to relying solely on the field's `creation_counter`, or another factor that remains immutable.

I have enough information from the retrieved `Field.__hash__()` code and the issue description to proceed with generating a patch.

```python
Ready generation: True

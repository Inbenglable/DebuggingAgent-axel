Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **astropy** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Modeling's `separability_matrix` does not compute separability correctly for nested CompoundModels
Consider the following model:

```python
from astropy.modeling import models as m
from astropy.modeling.separable import separability_matrix

cm = m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)
```

It's separability matrix as you might expect is a diagonal:

```python
>>> separability_matrix(cm)
array([[ True, False],
       [False,  True]])
```

If I make the model more complex:
```python
>>> separability_matrix(m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5))
array([[ True,  True, False, False],
       [ True,  True, False, False],
       [False, False,  True, False],
       [False, False, False,  True]])
```

The output matrix is again, as expected, the outputs and inputs to the linear models are separable and independent of each other.

If however, I nest these compound models:
```python
>>> separability_matrix(m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm)
array([[ True,  True, False, False],
       [ True,  True, False, False],
       [False, False,  True,  True],
       [False, False,  True,  True]])
```
Suddenly the inputs and outputs are no longer separable?

This feels like a bug to me, but I might be missing something?

This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
In analyzing the information provided, we have a test case that exposes an issue with the `separability_matrix` function. The separability matrix is expected to identify independent and separable inputs and outputs in models, but when applied to a nested compound model, the output is not as expected from the test.

The key issue is that when a model is nested, it seems to fail in computing separability correctly, showing dependency where there should be independence. The output array suggests that it treats all outputs of the `Pix2Sky_TAN` component as affecting all the inputs of the `Linear1D` components, which is incorrect.

In addressing this, we can trace the flow and logic within the `separability_matrix` function located in "astropy/modeling/separable.py" to determine where it incorrectly evaluates model separability in nested structures.

Therefore, the next step is to look more closely into the separability analysis logic specifically within this function to understand why it fails to evaluate nested models correctly.

Observed method: `astropy/modeling/separable.py:separability_matrix`
==================================================
Based on the information from the provided tracing and analysis, the discrepancy in separability computation arises in the `separability_matrix` function. The observed behavior suggests nested models are not being evaluated independently as expected, likely indicating an issue in the logic determining separability in nested CompoundModels.

As per the runtime tracing, the `separable_matrix` is created by calling a function named `_separable(transform)` and returned as a boolean matrix. The trace shows the `separable_matrix` calculation and its conversion to a boolean matrix by setting non-zero values to `True` at line 101.

To find the root cause of the issue, we need to inspect the internal logic of the `_separable` function, as that is where the actual matrix is calculated. This part seems to be incorrectly handling nested transformations by not maintaining the expected independence of outputs relative to inputs when models are nested.

Therefore, I need to observe the behavior inside the `_separable` function to understand how it's computing the separability for nested CompoundModels. By analyzing this, I will be able to identify why it does not compute the separability correctly.

Please provide the scope of the `_separable` function so I can trace the internal logic and determine where the computation goes awry.

Observed scope: `astropy/modeling/separable.py:100-101`
==================================================
Upon analyzing the current observation of the `separability_matrix` code snippet, we see:

1. The function `_separable` is crucial for computing the separability matrix. It appears to recursively evaluate separability by breaking down the `CompoundModel` into its constituent parts (`transform.left` and `transform.right`).

2. In the runtime information, `_separable(transform)` is called with the `CompoundModel`, resulting in two parts: `sepleft` and `sepright`. These represent the separability matrices of the left and right components, respectively.

3. The `sepleft` and `sepright` are then combined using an operator with `_operators[transform.op](sepleft, sepright)`. The final return value (`separable_matrix`) incorrectly asserts full separability between nested elements.

4. The returned matrix highlights the issue that it considers all outputs and inputs of the nested models as dependent. This suggests the handling of nested models in `_separable` might be incorrect.

Given this analysis, the issue likely resides within `_separable`, as it dictates the evaluation of compound model separability. I suspect the problem exists in how `_operators[transform.op]` applies the separability logic in nested structures.

Therefore, the next step is to observe the logic inside `_separable` method more closely, focusing on how it utilizes `_operators` to handle compound models.

Observed method: `astropy/modeling/separable.py:_separable`
==================================================


Now you choose downstream method _separable to further observe, tracing the abnormal program behavior.
This is the method code:
   290	def _separable(transform):
   291	    """
   292	    Calculate the separability of outputs.
   293	
   294	    Parameters
   295	    ----------

   297	        A transform (usually a compound model).
   298	
   299	    Returns :
   300	    is_separable : ndarray of dtype np.bool
   301	        An array of shape (transform.n_outputs,) of boolean type
   302	        Each element represents the separablity of the corresponding output.
   303	    """
   304	    if (transform_matrix := transform._calculate_separability_matrix()) is not NotImplemented:
   305	        return transform_matrix
   306	    elif isinstance(transform, CompoundModel):
   307	        sepleft = _separable(transform.left)
   308	        sepright = _separable(transform.right)
   309	        return _operators[transform.op](sepleft, sepright)
   310	    elif isinstance(transform, Model):
   311	        return _coord_matrix(transform, 'left', transform.n_outputs)


This is the runtime information of _separable:

You need to trace the abnormal program behavior step by step to identify the root cause of the bug and locate the buggy method that contains the code to be fixed.
Now, please first analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior. 

Then, if you can already locate the buggy method and buggy code, reply with:
Buggy method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Otherwise, continue tracing by telling me the code line scope that you want to deeper observe, we will show you the deeper downstream run-time information of the scope you select. Please reply with:
Observed scope: `{FILE_PATH}:{START_LOC}-{END_LOC}`
Note that {FILE_PATH} refers to the path relative to the repository.

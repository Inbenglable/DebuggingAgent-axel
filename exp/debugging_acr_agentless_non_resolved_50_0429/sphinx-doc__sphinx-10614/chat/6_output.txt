The current analysis and runtime information from the `InheritanceGraph.generate_dot` suggest that the URLs dictionary is passed empty (`urls = {}`) during the actual execution of this method. This discrepancy indicates that the place where URLs should be populated with correct paths for each class might not be functioning properly, especially when dealing with relative paths in non-root directories.

The bug seems to lie upstream in the method responsible for populating the URLs dictionary. However, tracing this phenomenon further necessitates understanding where and how the URLs are set for the classes that are included in this inheritance diagram generation process, which should reflect the correct relative paths based on the current directory context.

Let's examine part of the upstream code or analysis that leads to the URLs being an empty dictionary in the case of generating the diagram for files not located in the root directory.

Now You need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Query.resolve_lookup_value coerces value of type list to tuple
Description
	
Changes introduced in #30687 cause an input value list to be coerced to tuple breaking exact value queries. This affects ORM field types that are dependent on matching input types such as PickledField.
The expected iterable return type should match input iterable type.

</ISSUE>


You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To address the issue mentioned, I need to inspect the source code for the `resolve_lookup_value` method. This will help me understand where the coercion from list to tuple occurs so that I can make the necessary adjustments. Since the method name and its specific location in the codebase are not provided, I will utilize the `search_method_in_codebase` API to locate it.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("resolve_lookup_value")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("resolve_lookup_value")
RESULT:
#### django/db/models/sql/query.py:Query.resolve_lookup_value
```python
    def resolve_lookup_value(self, value, can_reuse, allow_joins, simple_col):
        if hasattr(value, 'resolve_expression'):
            kwargs = {'reuse': can_reuse, 'allow_joins': allow_joins}
            if isinstance(value, F):
                kwargs['simple_col'] = simple_col
            value = value.resolve_expression(self, **kwargs)
        elif isinstance(value, (list, tuple)):
            # The items of the iterable may be expressions and therefore need
            # to be resolved independently.
            resolved_values = []
            for sub_value in value:
                if hasattr(sub_value, 'resolve_expression'):
                    if isinstance(sub_value, F):
                        resolved_values.append(sub_value.resolve_expression(
                            self, reuse=can_reuse, allow_joins=allow_joins,
                            simple_col=simple_col,
                        ))
                    else:
                        resolved_values.append(sub_value.resolve_expression(
                            self, reuse=can_reuse, allow_joins=allow_joins,
                        ))
                else:
                    resolved_values.append(sub_value)
            value = tuple(resolved_values)
        return value

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

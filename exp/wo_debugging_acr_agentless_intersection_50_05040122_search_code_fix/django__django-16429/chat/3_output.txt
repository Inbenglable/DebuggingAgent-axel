To fix this issue, I need to understand how the `timesince` function currently handles timezones, particularly when the `USE_TZ` setting is `True`. The issue points out a specific line of code in the `timesince.py` file from the Django repository, suggesting that the `pivot` variable does not account for `tzinfo`.

Firstly, I need to examine the source code of the `timesince` function to see how it is currently implemented. I should search for the `timesince` method in its respective file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/utils/timesince.py", "timesince")
```

To resolve the given issue, I need to examine the `k_means` function called within the `KMeans.fit` method, primarily because it seems to be responsible for executing the algorithm and managing parallelization through the `n_jobs` parameter. Identifying how parallelization affects results inside this function could help us understand the discrepancy in results based on its parameters.

I'll search for the `k_means` function to review its implementation.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("k_means")
```

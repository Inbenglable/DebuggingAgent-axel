To resolve the issue where KMeans results differ depending on the `n_jobs` parameter, I need to review the relevant portions of code related to parallel execution within the KMeans implementation in scikit-learn. Specifically, I'll be looking into how the computations might differ when using multiple jobs versus a single job.

I need to search for the `KMeans` class in the scikit-learn codebase to locate the relevant portions that handle the `n_jobs` parameter.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("KMeans")
```

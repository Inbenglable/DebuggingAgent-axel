Issue resolved: **False**

### Analysis:

1. **Review of the Patch:**
   - The patch modifies the `_eval_subs` method in the `Piecewise` class to catch the `PolynomialError` and handle it by reverting to a simpler form using `as_expr_set_pairs`.
   - The intention behind this change is to handle substitution errors by simplifying the conditions, which may help avoid triggering the `PolynomialError`.

2. **Patched Output:**
   - The output after applying the patch shows that the `PolynomialError` was still raised during the test execution, causing the same failure as in the original output.
   - There is no change in behavior before and after applying the patch, as evidenced by the fact that the `PolynomialError` still occurs in the patched output.

### Conclusion:
The issue remains unresolved because the same `PolynomialError` appears both before and after applying the patch. The intended change did not successfully prevent the error from occurring, indicating that the problem was not properly addressed by the proposed patch.

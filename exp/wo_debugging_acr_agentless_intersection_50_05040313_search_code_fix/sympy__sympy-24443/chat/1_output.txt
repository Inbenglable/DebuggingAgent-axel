To address the issue where the `_check_homomorphism` function breaks for `PermutationGroups`, particularly in handling inverted generators, I first need to review the implementation of the `_image()` function in the `sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py` file. Specifically, I want to examine the lines where it handles the case involving a `PermutationGroup`.

I'll be searching for the `_image` method in the `homomorphisms.py` file to access the pertinent code.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py", "_image")
```

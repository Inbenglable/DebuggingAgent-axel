In order to address the issue, I need to retrieve the relevant code from the xarray repository. Specifically, I need to locate and inspect the implementation of the merge function within the specified file to understand how the `'override'` option of the `combine_attrs` parameter is currently handled.

Let's proceed with that:

```python
search_method_in_file("xarray/core/merge.py", "merge")
```

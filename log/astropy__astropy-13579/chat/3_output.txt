Based on the provided runtime information, the abnormal behavior occurs in the `SlicedLowLevelWCS` class where the `world_to_pixel_values` method of a sliced WCS object is returning an unexpectedly large value.

The observed method responsible for this behavior is likely:
Observed method: `astropy/wcs/wcsapi/wrappers/sliced_wcs.py:world_to_pixel_values`

I will now proceed to investigate this method to identify any issues contributing to the abnormal behavior and narrow down the location of the buggy code.

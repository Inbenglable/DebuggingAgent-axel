To resolve the issue, I need to review the implementation details of the `database_forwards` method in the `AddField` class and any SQLite-specific migration logic in Django, especially within the `SQLiteSchemaEditor`. This is to understand how fields with unique constraints are added in migrations.

I'll start by retrieving the source code for the `database_forwards` method in the `AddField` class and inspect any SQLite-specific schema handling in the `SQLiteSchemaEditor`.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py", "AddField.database_forwards")
search_class_in_codebase("SQLiteSchemaEditor")
```

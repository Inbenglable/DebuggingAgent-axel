Here is the issue: <issue>The `where` keyword argument of `np.mean` is not supported for `astropy.units.Quantity` instances.

### Description
<!-- Provide a general description of the feature you would like. -->
<!-- If you want to, you can suggest a draft design or API. -->
<!-- This way we have a deeper discussion on the feature. -->

Apologies if there is a duplicate somewhere, I scoured all the issues for this problem and I couldn't find it mentioned yet.

The `where` keyword argument was added to `np.mean` and all the other `np.reduce`-based functions in version 1.20.0 of numpy,
but it doesn't seem to work yet with `astopy.units.Quantity`.

Does anyone know if there is some limitation in `astropy.units.Quantity` that is preventing this feature from being implemented?

If not, I could put some time towards updating `astropy.units.Quantity` to support this feature.

First, please analyze the root cause of the issue.
==================================================

##assistant
The root cause of this issue appears to be:

1. Numpy added support for the `where` keyword argument in `np.mean` and other `np.reduce`-based functions in version 1.20.0.

2. However, this functionality is not yet supported for `astropy.units.Quantity` instances.

3. The `astropy.units.Quantity` class likely needs to be updated to handle this new keyword argument and incorporate it into its functionality when working with numpy operations.

4. This discrepancy creates an inconsistency between how numpy functions work on regular arrays versus Quantity objects, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors when users try to use the `where` argument with Quantity instances.

The issue stems from the need to keep Astropy's Quantity class up-to-date with new numpy features, especially those that affect fundamental operations like calculating means. Resolving this issue would involve updating the Quantity class to properly handle and utilize the `where` keyword argument in numpy reduction operations.

Analyze how to resolve the issue.
==================================================

##assistant
To resolve this issue, the following steps should be taken:

1. Update the `astropy.units.Quantity` class to support the `where` keyword argument in numpy reduction operations, particularly for `np.mean` and other `np.reduce`-based functions.

2. Modify the relevant methods in the Quantity class that handle numpy operations to properly process and utilize the `where` argument when it's provided.

3. Ensure that the implementation maintains consistency with numpy's behavior for regular arrays when using the `where` argument.

4. Add appropriate error handling and type checking for the `where` argument to ensure it's used correctly with Quantity objects.

5. Update the documentation for the Quantity class to reflect the new support for the `where` argument in relevant operations.

6. Write comprehensive unit tests to verify the correct functionality of the `where` argument with Quantity objects across various scenarios.

7. Ensure backwards compatibility, so that existing code using Quantity objects without the `where` argument continues to work as expected.

8. Consider performance implications and optimize the implementation if necessary.

9. Update any relevant examples or tutorials in the Astropy documentation that demonstrate using numpy reduction operations with Quantity objects.

10. After implementation, thoroughly test the changes across different numpy versions to ensure compatibility.

The core of the solution will likely involve modifying the `__array_function__` method of the Quantity class, which is responsible for handling numpy universal functions (ufuncs) and other numpy functions. This method would need to be updated to properly handle and pass along the `where` argument when it's provided for supported functions like `np.mean`.

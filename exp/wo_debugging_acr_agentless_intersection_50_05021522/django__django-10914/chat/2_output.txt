To resolve the issue of setting default file upload permissions in Django, we need to modify the `FileSystemStorage` class accordingly. I have identified that one of the methods that handles file saving could be `_save`. To make sure we access and modify it correctly, let's retrieve its source code from the `django/core/files/storage.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/files/storage.py", "FileSystemStorage._save")
```

To proceed with fixing the issue, I need to retrieve the source code of the `check_constraints` function in the `python3.7/site-packages/django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py` file to understand its current implementation and make the necessary modifications.

```python
search_method_in_file("python3.7/site-packages/django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py", "check_constraints")
```

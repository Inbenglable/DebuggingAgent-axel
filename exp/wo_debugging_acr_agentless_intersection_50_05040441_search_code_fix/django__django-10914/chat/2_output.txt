To address the issue you mentioned regarding file upload permissions in Django, it's crucial to identify where file-saving operations are handled, particularly on the `FileSystemStorage` class. We are especially interested in file handling methods related to permissions during file upload.

Let's now analyze the returned results. Here are the parts that seem relevant:

1. `django/core/files/storage.py:Storage.save`: This appears to be relevant because it deals with saving files and potentially their permissions but is focusing on lower-level file saving operations which might affect `FileSystemStorage`.

2. `django/db/models/fields/files.py:FieldFile.save`: This method deals with storing file information and possibly interacts with `FileSystemStorage`.

Other entries appear to be either related to models or sessions and do not pertain directly to file storage operations within `FileSystemStorage`.

Thus, the analysis suggests the following files and methods are required to address the file permission issue:

```
django/core/files/storage.py:Storage.save
django/db/models/fields/files.py:FieldFile.save
```

These locations are most likely where changes can be made to enforce uniform file permissions during uploads.

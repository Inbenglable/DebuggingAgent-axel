To resolve the issue, I need to examine the code of the `evalf` method in the `sympy/core/evalf.py` file. This will help in understanding the flow and where exactly the `UnboundLocalError` occurs, as well as where to add the suggested `else: raise NotImplementedError`. Therefore, I will search for the `evalf` method in the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/core/evalf.py", "evalf")
```

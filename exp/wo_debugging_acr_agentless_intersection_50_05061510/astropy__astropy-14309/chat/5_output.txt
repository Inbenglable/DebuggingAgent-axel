Based on the information provided, the proposed patch modifies the `is_fits` function in `astropy/io/fits/connect.py` to check if `args` list contains any elements before accessing `args[0]`. This prevents the `IndexError` from occurring when the `args` list is empty.

### Original Code:
```python
return isinstance(args[0], (HDUList, TableHDU, BinTableHDU, GroupsHDU))
```

### Patched Code:
```python
return len(args) > 0 and isinstance(args[0], (HDUList, TableHDU, BinTableHDU, GroupsHDU))
```

### Analysis:

1. **Original Output**: The test results in an `IndexError: tuple index out of range`, which indicates that the code is attempting to access an element in an empty list.
2. **Patched Output**: The test has no output, which implies that the `IndexError` has been resolved.

Reviewing the changes:
- The patch ensures that the code only attempts to access the first element of `args` if `args` contains at least one element.
- This directly addresses the cause of the `IndexError` by ensuring safe access to the list.

Since the patched output shows that no error occurs and the `AssertionError` which was meant to reproduce the issue deliberately is not raised anymore, it indicates that the issue is resolved.

### Conclusion:
Issue resolved: `True`

Given the issue description, it seems the issue is related to how `flush()` is used in Django management commands, specifically during migrations. To resolve this problem, I need to look into the Django management command implementations, particularly around how standard output and error streams are managed and flushed. I will start by searching for the relevant code that deals with flushing in Django's management commands.

To begin addressing this issue, I'll search for the usage of `flush()` within Django's management command codebase. Let's use the search APIs to retrieve the necessary source code.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("flush")
search_class_in_codebase("MigrationExecutor")
search_method_in_codebase("MigrationExecutor.migrate")
```

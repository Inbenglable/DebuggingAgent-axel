You are a PR reviewer that needs to review the patch generated by a bug repair agent and determine whether the issue is fixed or not.
This is the bug issue, which is in the **sympy** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
PythonCodePrinter doesn't support Min and Max
We can't generate python code for the sympy function Min and Max.

For example:
```
from sympy import symbols, Min, pycode
a, b = symbols("a b")
c = Min(a,b)
print(pycode(c))
```
the output is:

```
  # Not supported in Python:
  # Min
Min(a, b)
```

Similar to issue #16669, we should add following methods to PythonCodePrinter:

```
def _print_Min(self, expr):
    return "min({})".format(", ".join(self._print(arg) for arg in expr.args))


def _print_Max(self, expr):
    return "max({})".format(", ".join(self._print(arg) for arg in expr.args))

```

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
## REPRODUCE TEST
```
import traceback
import sys
from sympy import symbols, Min, pycode
from sympy.printing.pycode import PythonCodePrinter

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    a, b = symbols("a b")
    c = Min(a, b)
    try:
        # Attempt to generate Python code for Min function
        generated_code = pycode(c)
        # Check if the generated code is not the expected output
        if "min(" not in generated_code:
            raise AssertionError(f"Expected 'min(a, b)' but got '{generated_code}'")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("PythonCodePrinter does not support Min and Max functions.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

And this is the original output when running the test (before applying the patch):
## ORIGINAL OUTPUT
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/sympy__sympy-22914/reproduce.py"
    24: raise AssertionError(f"Expected 'min(a, b)' but got '{generated_code}'")
AssertionError: Expected 'min(a, b)' but got '((a) if (a <= b) else (b))'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/sympy__sympy-22914/reproduce.py", line 24, in main
    raise AssertionError(f"Expected 'min(a, b)' but got '{generated_code}'")
AssertionError: Expected 'min(a, b)' but got '((a) if (a <= b) else (b))'

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/sympy__sympy-22914/reproduce.py", line 30, in <module>
    main()
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/sympy__sympy-22914/reproduce.py", line 27, in main
    raise AssertionError("PythonCodePrinter does not support Min and Max functions.")
AssertionError: PythonCodePrinter does not support Min and Max functions.

```

The repair agent has tried to generate a patch to fix the issue:
## PATCH CONTEXT
<PATCH_CONTEXT>
To resolve the issue, I'll add the `_print_Min` and `_print_Max` methods in the `PythonCodePrinter` class located in the `sympy/printing/pycode.py` file. Here are the modifications needed to support the `Min` and `Max` functions:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/printing/pycode.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass PythonCodePrinter(AbstractPythonCodePrinter):\n=======\nclass PythonCodePrinter(AbstractPythonCodePrinter):\n\n    def _print_Min(self, expr):\n        return \"min({})\".format(\", \".join(self._print(arg) for arg in expr.args))\n\n    def _print_Max(self, expr):\n        return \"max({})\".format(\", \".join(self._print(arg) for arg in expr.args))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch adds the necessary methods to convert the `Min` and `Max` SymPy functions into Python's native `min()` and `max()` functions, enabling proper code generation using `pycode`.

After applying the patch, the output of the test is:

Now, please first review the patch and analyse the test output before and after the patch, to determine whether the issue is fixed or not.

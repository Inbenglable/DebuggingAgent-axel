The current analysis shows that the issue arises due to the bin calculations when the `density=True` parameter is used in the `plt.hist()` function. The function `hist()` in `matplotlib.pyplot` calls the corresponding method in `matplotlib.axes.Axes`.

To pinpoint where the bins are calculated, which results in the observed discrepancy, I need to trace the function further into the `matplotlib.axes.Axes` where the actual bin computation is happening.

Based on the information provided, I will focus on `matplotlib.axes.Axes.hist`. This will allow us to trace into how bins are computed and specifically how the `range` and `density` parameters are applied.

Observed scope: `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py:6525-6625`

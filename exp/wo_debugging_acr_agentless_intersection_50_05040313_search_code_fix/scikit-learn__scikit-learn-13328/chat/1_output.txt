To resolve the issue reported, the root cause seems to be centered around handling boolean arrays in the `HuberRegressor.fit()` method. Instead of raising an exception, the boolean arrays should be converted to a float type, similar to how other regressors handle boolean input data. 

To address this, I will need to inspect the implementation of the `HuberRegressor.fit()` method and understand where this type conversion needs to take place.

Therefore, I will retrieve the source code for the `HuberRegressor` class and specifically locate the `fit` method to gather the necessary information to create a proper patch.

Here are the steps required to retrieve the source code:

1. Determine the file path for the `HuberRegressor` class.
2. Locate and retrieve the `fit` method within this class to analyze how to fix the issue.

Now, let's proceed with retrieving the code:

```python
search_class_in_codebase("HuberRegressor")
search_method_in_file("sklearn/linear_model/_huber.py", "HuberRegressor.fit")
```

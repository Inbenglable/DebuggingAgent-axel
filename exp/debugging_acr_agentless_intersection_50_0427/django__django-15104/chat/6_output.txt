To generate the patch for resolving the `KeyError` issue by adopting the user's suggestion of modifying the deletion of the 'to' key in the `only_relation_agnostic_fields` method, I need to retrieve the source code of this method within the `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` file.

Thus, I'm going to search for the `MigrationAutodetector.only_relation_agnostic_fields` method in the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/autodetector.py", "MigrationAutodetector.only_relation_agnostic_fields")
```

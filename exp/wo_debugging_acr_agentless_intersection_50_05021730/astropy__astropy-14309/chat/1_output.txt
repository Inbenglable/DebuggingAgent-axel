To resolve the issue, I need to inspect the source code of `identify_format` and the relevant piece inside `astropy/io/fits/connect.py` where the `is_fits` function is defined. This way, I can understand why the IndexError is being raised and what the expected behavior of `identify_format` is. 

I'll start by retrieving the source code for these two parts.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("identify_format")
search_code_in_file("astropy/io/fits/connect.py", "is_fits")
```

To resolve the issue, we need to further investigate how attributes are being processed specifically with the `combine_attrs='override'` flag. We have seen the implementation of the `merge` function, which calls `merge_core`. Since the reported issue involves the attribute combination logic, it is essential to review the `merge_core` function implementation. Therefore, I will search for the definition of the `merge_core` function to understand how the `combine_attrs='override'` setting is being handled.

```python
search_method_in_file("xarray/core/merge.py", "merge_core")
```

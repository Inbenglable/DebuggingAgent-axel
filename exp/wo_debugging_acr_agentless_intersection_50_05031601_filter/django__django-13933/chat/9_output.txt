### Patch Review

The patch aims to modify the `default_error_messages` for the `ModelChoiceField` class in Django forms. Specifically, it updates the `invalid_choice` message to include the `% (value)s` parameter, which is intended to display the invalid choice in the error message. The updated message is:

```
'invalid_choice': _('Select a valid choice. %(value)s is not one of the available choices.')
```

This aligns with the issue description, which requests that the invalid choice value should be included in the `ValidationError`.

### Test Output Analysis

**Original Output:**
Before applying the patch, the test script fails with a `ModuleNotFoundError`, indicating that the module `reproducer` required for setting up Django's environment is missing. This means the actual error related to the `ModelChoiceField` does not get tested due to the misconfiguration/setup issue.

**Patched Output:**
The patched output shows the same error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'reproducer'`. This suggests that the script environment still needs proper configuration. Again, the test for the issue is not executed because of the environment setup error.

### Conclusion

Given both outputs are identical and highlight an unrelated setup error, we do not have clear evidence from the test execution output to conclude if the patch resolves the `ModelChoiceField` issue appropriately. The focus should first be on correcting the environment setup to run the test effectively. Without resolving the module import error, the efficacy of the patch cannot be determined from the provided information.

Issue resolved: `False`

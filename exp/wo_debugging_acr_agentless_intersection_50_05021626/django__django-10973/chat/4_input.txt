Now You need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Use subprocess.run and PGPASSWORD for client in postgres backend
Description
	
â€‹subprocess.run was added in python 3.5 (which is the minimum version since Django 2.1). This function allows you to pass a custom environment for the subprocess.
Using this in django.db.backends.postgres.client to set PGPASSWORD simplifies the code and makes it more reliable.

</ISSUE>


You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To address the issue, I need to modify the method in `django.db.backends.postgres.client` where subprocesses are run. I will need to check the Postgres client implementation to locate the correct method and understand how it's currently handling subprocess execution. Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code associated with the relevant method.

Given that I don't know the exact file path of the client class within the Postgres backend, I will search for the relevant method in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("client")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("client")
RESULT:
#### tests/template_tests/views.py:client
```python
def client(request, id):
    pass

```


==================================================

Your Output:
To resolve this issue, I need to find the specific method in the `django.db.backends.postgres.client` that handles subprocess execution for PostgreSQL connections. The search result for "client" wasn't useful, as it led to a different part of the codebase.

To locate the correct method, I should conduct a further search specifically within the PostgreSQL backend's client code. Given the common structure of Django database backends, the relevant code is likely situated in the directory `django/db/backends/postgresql/`. I need to search the codebase to locate methods related to subprocess handling within this module.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("subprocess")
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py", "runshell")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py", "runshell")
RESULT:
#### django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py:DatabaseClient.runshell
```python
    def runshell(self):
        DatabaseClient.runshell_db(self.connection.get_connection_params())

```


==================================================

Your Output:
To address the issue, I need to modify the `runshell` method in `django.db.backends.postgresql.client`. I found the method signature but I need to retrieve the full source code for this method to understand how it handles subprocess execution. This will allow me to introduce the necessary changes using `subprocess.run` and `PGPASSWORD`. 

I will search for the method `runshell_db` as it seems to be the method that actually handles the database client connection.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py", "runshell_db")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py", "runshell_db")
RESULT:
#### django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py:DatabaseClient.runshell_db
```python
    def runshell_db(cls, conn_params):
        args = [cls.executable_name]

        host = conn_params.get('host', '')
        port = conn_params.get('port', '')
        dbname = conn_params.get('database', '')
        user = conn_params.get('user', '')
        passwd = conn_params.get('password', '')

        if user:

                except UnicodeEncodeError:
                    # If the current locale can't encode the data, let the
                    # user input the password manually.
                    pass
            # Allow SIGINT to pass to psql to abort queries.
            signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal.SIG_IGN)
            subprocess.check_call(args)
        finally:
            # Restore the original SIGINT handler.

                temp_pgpass.close()
                if 'PGPASSFILE' in os.environ:  # unit tests need cleanup
                    del os.environ['PGPASSFILE']

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

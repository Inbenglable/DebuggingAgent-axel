**Patch Review:**

The patch attempts to optimize the migration operations by removing consecutive pairs of `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex` that target the same model and index. The logic implemented in the patch is supposed to identify these pairs and eliminate them from the operations list.

**Test Output Analysis:**

- **Original Output:** The test outputs an `AssertionError` confirming the presence of excessive `AddIndex`/`RemoveIndex` operations. This indicates that the issue identified in the test is present in the initial code implementation.
  
- **Patched Output:** The patched output remains the same, with an `AssertionError` indicating the presence of excessive `AddIndex`/`RemoveIndex` operations. This suggests that the patch did not address the issue effectively.

**Conclusion:**

The unchanged output after applying the patch indicates that the patch did not successfully reduce the excessive `AddIndex`/`RemoveIndex` operations as intended. The logic, while seemingly correct in identifying and removing pairs, did not work in practice as evidenced by the continued test failure.

Issue resolved: `False`

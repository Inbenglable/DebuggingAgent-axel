Given the issue description, there seems to be a problem in determining if `p.new` is in `sentinels` when `p.new` is an array. This error is originating from `/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/_pytest/compat.py` in the method `num_mock_patch_args`. The necessary fix would likely involve modifying how the check `p.new in sentinels` is performed.

I'll need to retrieve the source code for the method `num_mock_patch_args` in the file `_pytest/compat.py` to understand how the code is working and to generate a patch.

```python
search_method_in_file("_pytest/compat.py", "num_mock_patch_args")
```

To resolve the issue, I need to review the source code for the `coerce_pandas_values` function in the `xarray/core/merge.py` file. This will help to understand how the function operates and why it currently doesn't handle `DataArray` objects correctly. I will proceed to search for the method in the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("xarray/core/merge.py", "coerce_pandas_values")
```

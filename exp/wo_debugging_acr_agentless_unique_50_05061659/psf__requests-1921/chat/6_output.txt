The `merge_setting` function already handles the case where keys are set to `None` by removing them from the merged setting. This means that if the headers are correctly manipulated and passed to `merge_setting`, this issue could be resolved.

The focus should be on how headers are set within the `Session` class and whether there's any leftover mechanism that mistakenly converts `None` values to an actual "None" string. I already have the relevant code for the `prepare_request` and `merge_setting`. Therefore, I've gathered enough information to proceed with generating a patch to resolve the issue.

Ready generation: `True`

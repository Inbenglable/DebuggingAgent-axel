Reviewing the provided patch and its context reveals a modification aimed at addressing the handling of inverted generators within a `PermutationGroup`. The patch modifies the `_image()` function within `_check_homomorphism` to address the issue with inverted generators. It does so by adding a check to see if the inverse `r[i]**-1` exists within the `gens` list and handling it accordingly.

From the test output before and after applying the patch:

1. **Original Output:** The exception `ValueError: The given images do not define a homomorphism` is raised, indicating the presence of the issue when executing the test code before the patch is applied.

2. **Patched Output:** The message "No exception raised, the issue might be fixed." is printed, indicating that the patched code no longer raises the exception and this specific test case runs without errors.

Given the information above, the patch successfully resolves the immediate issue with inverted generators and allows the provided test to execute without raising exceptions.

Issue resolved: `True`

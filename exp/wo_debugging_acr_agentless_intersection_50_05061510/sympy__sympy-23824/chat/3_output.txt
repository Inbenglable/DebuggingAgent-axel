To fix the issue in the `kahane_simplify` function, we need to ensure that the leading gamma matrices are appended in the correct order after processing. Let's address this by using a forward loop for appending the leading gamma matrices rather than a backward loop.

Here's the patch:

```pythony
### sympy/physics/hep/gamma_matrices.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    for i in range(0, first_dum_pos):
        [ri.insert(0, free_pos[i]) for ri in resulting_indices]
=======
    for i in range(first_dum_pos - 1, -1, -1):
        [ri.insert(0, free_pos[i]) for ri in resulting_indices]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

In the `SEARCH` section, the leading gamma matrices are inserted in reverse order (`range(0, first_dum_pos)`) at the start of the resulting indices list. This leads to the bug as described.

The `REPLACE` section modifies the loop to use reverse inclusion (`range(first_dum_pos - 1, -1, -1)`), ensuring that leading gamma matrices are appended in the correct order, maintaining the logic described in the issue.

Here is the JSON description with the relevant code edits:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/physics/hep/gamma_matrices.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    for i in range(0, first_dum_pos):\n        [ri.insert(0, free_pos[i]) for ri in resulting_indices]\n=======\n    for i in range(first_dum_pos - 1, -1, -1):\n        [ri.insert(0, free_pos[i]) for ri in resulting_indices]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

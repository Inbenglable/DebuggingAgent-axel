To generate the patch for the `srepr` function, I need to retrieve the source code of relevant `_print_*` methods in the `ReprPrinter` class that handle cases for `dict` and `set`. Since I need to obtain their source code, I'll search for these methods individually within `sympy/printing/repr.py`.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/repr.py", "ReprPrinter._print_dict")
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/repr.py", "ReprPrinter._print_set")
```

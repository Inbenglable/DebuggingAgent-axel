Analyzing the provided information, the error occurs when trying to create instances of the `Avg` and `Sum` classes with the `distinct=True` argument. The traceback indicates that the error is thrown in the `__init__` method of the `Aggregate` class, which is part of Django's ORM aggregation system. The error message is "Avg does not allow distinct" and "Sum does not allow distinct," suggesting that the `distinct` parameter is checked in this method.

The error arises in the following part of the code, found in the `__init__` method:

```python
if distinct and not self.allow_distinct:
    raise TypeError("%s does not allow distinct." % self.__class__.__name__)
```

This indicates that `allow_distinct` is a variable or attribute that controls whether distinct is permitted for this aggregation.

To determine if this is the buggy method, further investigation would be necessary to check whether modifying this behavior is the expected resolution of the issue. But based on the current context, it appears to be the check preventing the desired functionality is indeed within the `__init__` method of the `Aggregate` class.

Therefore, the buggy method is:

Buggy method: `django/db/models/aggregates.py:__init__`

The error encountered is an `AttributeError` indicating that a `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'to'`. This occurs when the `@u.quantity_input` decorator is used on a constructor (`__init__`) with a return type annotation of `None`.

The traceback indicates the error originates from:
- File: `astropy/units/decorators.py`
- Line: 224
- Code Context: `return return_.to(wrapped_signature.return_annotation)`

Given that the problem occurs within the `wrapper` function, this is a candidate for inspection. Let's analyze the decorator related to this line to identify and address the issue.

Observed method: `astropy/units/decorators.py:QuantityInput.wrapper`

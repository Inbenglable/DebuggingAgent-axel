The test before applying the patch throws an `IndexError: list index out of range` due to the generator being exhausted. The patch introduces a modification to convert the generator to a list before it is passed to `cross_val_score`, ensuring the splits are not exhausted prematurely.

However, after applying the patch, there is a `SyntaxError` stating "positional argument follows keyword argument." This indicates a syntactical mistake was introduced in the patch, which prevents the code from even running.

Therefore, despite the patch's intention to fix the issue of the generator being exhausted, it introduced a new error that stops execution entirely. As a result, the original issue is not resolved because the modified code cannot run.

Issue resolved: `False`

To determine if the issue is resolved, we need to examine the following:

1. **Review the Patch**:
   - The patch modifies the `__str__` method in the `Columns` class. It ensures that a space is added before the column suffix if the suffix is not an empty string, which should address the whitespace issues detailed in the issue description.

2. **Analyze the Test Outputs**:
   - **Original Output**: The test failed with a `ModuleNotFoundError` for `AddIndex`. This suggests that the test setup has an issue before it even addresses the specific SQL generation problem.
   - **Patched Output**: The output remains the same with a `ModuleNotFoundError` for `AddIndex`. This means that the test code was not executed successfully to verify the changes made by the patch.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The patch itself makes a reasonable change that could potentially fix the whitespace issue described. However, since both the original and patched output indicate that the test could not be executed due to a `ModuleNotFoundError`, we cannot determine if the patch fixes the SQL generation issue because the test did not run successfully.

Based on the information provided and the unchanged error outputs, we conclude that:

Issue resolved: `False`

To resolve the issue of integer overflow in the `fowlkes_mallows_score` function, we will modify the calculation of the Fowlkes-Mallows index. The proposed solution will change the computation to prevent overflow by using the alternative formula provided in the issue report. Here are the necessary changes:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sklearn/metrics/cluster/supervised.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    return tk / np.sqrt(pk * qk) if tk != 0. else 0.\n=======\n    return np.sqrt(tk / pk) * np.sqrt(tk / qk) if tk != 0. else 0.\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This change ensures that the calculation won't surpass the integer limit by breaking the operation into two separate square root calculations.

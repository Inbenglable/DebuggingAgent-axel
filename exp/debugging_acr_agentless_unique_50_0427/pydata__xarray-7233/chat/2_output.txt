Based on the code for the `Coarsen.construct` method, let's analyze the important sections to identify where the issue could arise:

1. **Setting Coordinates**: The issue is about non-dimensional coordinates being demoted to variables. In the `construct` method, coordinates are being set in line 977:
   ```python
   should_be_coords = set(window_dim) & set(self.obj.coords)
   result = reshaped.set_coords(should_be_coords)
   ```

   This code selects only those coordinates that are also part of the `window_dim`. However, the `day` coordinate is not a dimension, and thus likely gets excluded from the `should_be_coords` set. As a result, it is not being maintained as a coordinate in the `result`.

2. **Reshaping Process**: The loop through `obj.variables.items()` from lines 964 to 974 reshapes each variable. However, it doesn't seem to make any special checks for non-dimensional coordinates initially set in `ds` before coarsening.

The key area to focus on is the process where coordinates are set after reshaping the dataset because the preservation of the `day` coordinate is not handled, leading to the demotion of `day` from a coordinate to a variable.

To pinpoint the root cause, let's observe deeper into the method:

Observed scope: `xarray/core/rolling.py:964-977`

This will help further elucidate whether the issue lies in how variables and coordinates are handled during reshaping, and why non-dimensional coordinates are demoted.

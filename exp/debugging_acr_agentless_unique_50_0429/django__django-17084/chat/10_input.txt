## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Cannot use aggregate over window functions since 4.2
Description
	 
		(last modified by younes-chaoui)
	 
After upgrading to Django 4.2, I encountered an exception when executing ORM queries that involve aggregates over Window functions. The specific error was psycopg2.errors.GroupingError: aggregate function calls cannot contain window function calls
Dependencies :
psycopg2 version: 2.9.3
django version: 4.2.3
PostgreSQL version: 13.4
Example Code:
queryset = queryset.annotate(
	cumul_DJR=Coalesce(Window(Sum("DJR"), order_by=F("date").asc()), 0.0)
)
aggregate = queryset.aggregate(
	DJR_total=Sum("DJR"),
	cumul_DJR_total=Sum("cumul_DJR")
)

</ISSUE>

This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
The issue revolves around an incompatibility introduced in Django 4.2, where aggregate functions are no longer allowed to operate over results from window functions. The test provided attempts to simulate this problem by performing a window function annotation followed by an aggregate query, which results in an error.

Let's break down the behavior:
1. **Window Function:** `Window(Sum("DJR"), order_by=F("date").asc())` is used to compute a running total (`cumul_DJR`) over the `DJR` values for each entry, ordered by `date`.

2. **Aggregation:** The attempted aggregation `queryset.aggregate(DJR_total=Sum("DJR"), cumul_DJR_total=Sum("cumul_DJR"))` tries to sum up the values computed by the window function, leading to the `psycopg2.errors.GroupingError` because PostgreSQL doesn't allow aggregates directly over window function results.

3. The observed behavior indicates that the interaction between the aggregation function (`Sum`) and the window function needs to be modified or separated because PostgreSQL does not support this operation directly.

To address the error message about `conda.cli.main_run:execute(125)`, it seems unrelated to the primary issue about Django ORM queries, and instead pertains to the test execution environment setup. The test fails due to a missing import `sys`, but this is secondary to solving the Django issue itself.

The primary focus should be to decouple the aggregation logic so it doesn't directly operate on window function conclusions in ORM terms. This might involve restructuring the query logic or aggregating only original non-window results in PostgreSQL-compatible form.

Given this analysis, the issue likely resides in the querying methodology itself rather than a specific buggy method within Django's internals. This requires a reconsideration of the ORM query design rather than a direct trace into Django's source methods.

Since there's no explicit call to any Django code lines, it's clear that the complication is the approach rather than a bug in Django itself or psycopg2.

To proceed, we should focus on understanding the composition of queries involving window functions. Django's documentation or source code may hold more details on managing annotations cleanly in line with this exception.

Thus, considering the need to address the query construction, the next step is to observe Django's ORM or database backend handling. Specifically, how Django forms or transforms queries regarding window functions.

Observed method: `django/db/models/query.py:annotate`
==================================================
The issue reported is related to using aggregate functions on window function results with Django 4.2, which is resulting in a `GroupingError` from PostgreSQL. In the observed runtime information, we saw an `ImportError` when trying to import `Window` from `django.db.models.functions`, which suggests a separate issue in the test setup.

However, the real problem lies in how the query using window functions and aggregations is constructed. The behavior change in Django 4.2, where it disallows aggregate operations over window function results directly, is rooted in how Django internally constructs SQL queries. This isn't a direct bug in Djangoâ€™s code, but a necessity based on PostgreSQL's SQL behavior compatibility.

The key here is to understand that PostgreSQL doesn't allow an aggregate function call over a window function result, which means this Django query pattern can't be translated to SQL correctly under PostgreSQL's rules.

**Current Analysis:**
1. **Window and Aggregate Functions Incompatibility:** The code tries to perform an aggregate operation (using `Sum`) directly over a window function result (`Window(Sum(...))`), which PostgreSQL does not support.
2. **ImportError:** There's an apparent misconfiguration or misunderstanding of the `import` path given Django's refactoring or restructuring of module imports.
3. **Code Location:** The issue inherently lies with the method producing queries (like `annotate`) that cause the problem when translated to SQL. 

Given this information, to correct the query:
- Consider restructuring the query logic to avoid direct aggregation over a window function. One potential solution is to compute the window function results independently and then perform the aggregation in application logic manually.
  
To locate the underlying constraints and behavior, further analysis of Django's query construction methods is needed. Let's delve deeper into the `QuerySet._annotate` method, which handles annotation in queries.

Observed scope: `django/db/models/query.py:1602-1610`
==================================================
The error in the provided runtime information indicates an `ImportError` involving the `Window` function from `django.db.models.functions`. This error suggests that the `Window` function may not exist in the path specified for import in this context. This specific issue is a part of the observed test script execution but does not resolve the main issue about the behavior change in aggregate operations over window functions starting from Django 4.2. However, it is an important setup problem which needs correction before further runtime analysis.

The key tangential problem here concerns two things:
1. **Incorrect Import Path:** `Window` should be imported properly from available Django model functions.
2. **Query Construction Issue:** Aggregate operations over window function results directly should not be attempted in PostgreSQL.

Given the current observation, the focus should be on understanding the interaction when using the `Window` function within Django's ORM for PostgreSQL. The problematic behavior is likely in the query construction or annotations.

Upon inspecting the `annotate` functionality, we are actually looking at the mechanism Django uses to apply computations (like windows or aggregates) on query sets. The method `_annotate` appears responsible for how these computations are applied, but deeper observation into how it constructs or modifies the queries is needed.

Next, I will observe the `QuerySet._annotate` method as it seems critical in understanding how annotations get processed and how query construction might be causing incompatibility with PostgreSQL's handling of window functions and aggregate functions.

Observed method: `django/db/models/query.py:QuerySet._annotate`
==================================================
The issue reported is about a change in behavior in Django 4.2 that causes a `GroupingError` in PostgreSQL when trying to use aggregate functions over window functions. This is highlighted by the error `psycopg2.errors.GroupingError: aggregate function calls cannot contain window function calls`. This is due to the SQL limitations where PostgreSQL does not allow executing an aggregate function directly over a window function's result.

### Analysis of the Observed Code and Runtime Behavior

1. **Method Involved: `_annotate` in `django/db/models/query.py`:**
   - The method `_annotate` is used to apply annotations (including window functions) to a query. In this context, it's primarily responsible for handling computational values that are to be appended to each query result but not necessarily for transforming them into aggregations compatible with PostgreSQL.
   - The observed scope involves ensuring no conflicts in naming, preparation of annotations, and performing clone operations which includes marking of group by clauses based on conditions met (like containing aggregates).

2. **Runtime Error:**
   - The `ImportError` related to `Window` not being found in `django.db.models.functions` indicates a setup or configuration issue in the test script, suggesting `Window` has been moved or should be imported differently.
   - The main issue, however, is not the import or setup, but how Django translates query logic into SQL in a way that it tries to perform invalid operations on a window function, such as aggregating its result.

### Next Steps for Bug Localization

The issue described doesn't directly point to a bug in the method's implementation but suggests that the method `_annotate` or related query construction methods fail to prevent inappropriate operations like aggregation over window functions, potentially not enforcing necessary SQL restrictions. Rather than a coding mistake, this issue is more about missing logic to guide proper usage or error handling when composing such queries.

### Conclusion

As of now, the `_annotate` method doesn't appear to be directly buggy but rather does not restrict users or handle situations where an aggregation function is inappropriately attempted on a window function. The solution involves understanding Django's internals on query transformations and constraints, to intercept or catch such logically inappropriate usages.

### Further Investigation Needed

To explicitly follow how window annotations are being processed and their relationships to the final SQL query formation, further analysis into how Django processes annotations might be necessary, specifically around how constraints are applied in query formations to align with PostgreSQL. 

I suggest observing more of the methods related to query processing and their interaction with database backends:

Observed scope: `django/db/models/sql/query.py:Query.add_annotation` 

This method might provide insight into how annotations are compiled into query plans and where enforcement of aggregation limitations could potentially be integrated.
==================================================
To analyze the current situation, let's break down the issues presented:

1. **`ImportError` for `Window`:** The test script is trying to import `Window` from `django.db.models.functions`, but `Window` is not found in this location. This suggests that the import path for `Window` might have changed in Django 4.2 or later versions, or it's incorrectly specified in the script.

2. **`psycopg2.errors.GroupingError`:** This is the main issue reported where PostgreSQL does not allow aggregate functions over window function results. Django ORM attempts such a query, leading to an exception.

### Current Analysis:

- The import issue needs to be resolved first to correctly identify any subsequent runtime errors and behaviors. Fixing the import path would allow us to observe more meaningful runtime behavior related to the `GroupingError`.
- The problem seems to originate from how the Django ORM constructs SQL queries when using a window function with an aggregation directly on it, which PostgreSQL does not allow.

### Method Analysis:

The method `add_annotation` in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` is responsible for adding annotation expressions to a query. It resolves the expression and sets the annotation with the given alias. This method handles annotations but doesn't have direct interaction with ensuring that aggregation rules are SQL-compliant regarding the use of window functions.

Given the function of `add_annotation`, it doesn't directly address the SQL constraint issue encountered but is part of the larger query construction process where annotations (like window functions) are added.

### Next Steps:

To further identify where the issue lies, we need to examine how Django's ORM manages SQL query construction, focusing on constraints regarding annotations and aggregation.

I'll proceed by observing the area where annotations and their constraints might be processed to comply with PostgreSQL capabilities, as adding the annotations separately does not inherently avoid the error seen.

#### To further investigate:
I'll look deeper into the logic that handles SQL query construction involving annotations and aggregates:

Observed scope: `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py:406-440`

This section might provide insights into how queries involving annotations are compiled, which is crucial for understanding how constraints related to PostgreSQL's handling of aggregates over window functions are imposed.

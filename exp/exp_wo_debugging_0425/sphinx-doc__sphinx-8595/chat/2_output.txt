Based on the issue related to the autodoc extension in Sphinx, I will be focusing on the `setup` method implementation of the components related to the autodoc functionality within Sphinx. Specifically, this issue is about how the `__all__` attribute is treated by the autodoc extension. We need methods involved in the initialization of the autodoc extension to see how it is currently configured and handles its logic.

Here's the relevant selection from the invocation results, focusing on the Sphinx autodoc setup:

```
sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:setup
sphinx/ext/autodoc/type_comment.py:setup
sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py:setup
```

These entries are directly related to the sphinx.ext.autodoc module, which is where handling of `__all__` attribute is likely implemented or influenced.

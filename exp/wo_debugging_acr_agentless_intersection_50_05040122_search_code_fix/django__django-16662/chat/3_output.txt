Upon reviewing the returned API content, the goal is to identify where the import handling logic might be for migration files. We are looking for files that deal with migration writing, potentially using the `MigrationWriter` class or similar.

Based on this, the relevant lines from the API results are:

- `tests/migrations/test_writer.py:924-930`

This line contains a test that specifically checks the formatted output of migration files, including the order of imports, which is directly relevant to our issue.

Here's the selection of the necessary content:

```
tests/migrations/test_writer.py:924-930
```

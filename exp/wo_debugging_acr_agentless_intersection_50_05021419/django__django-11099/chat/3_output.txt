Here's the patch in the *SEARCH/REPLACE* format to fix the issue with trailing newlines in usernames for both `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator`.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/auth/validators.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    regex = r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'\n=======\n    regex = r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/contrib/auth/validators.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    regex = r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'\n=======\n    regex = r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

These changes ensure that usernames cannot end with a newline by replacing the `^` and `$` anchors with `\A` and `\Z` respectively, which are the correct start and end anchors that do not match at line breaks.

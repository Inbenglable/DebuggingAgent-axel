The observed program behavior indicates an issue when handling the `Contains` object in the `Piecewise.eval` method. The key line of code that triggers the behavior is line 136 in `/sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`. Specifically, the method attempts to call `as_set()` on a `Contains` object, but the implementation currently returns the `Contains` object rather than a set. Consequently, it lacks an `as_relational` method necessary for proper evaluation.

From the tracing history and analysis:

#### Observations:
- The test case reproduces an `AttributeError` due to the lack of the `as_relational` method within the `Piecewise` evaluation process.
- `Contains.as_set()` doesn't return a set as expected, leading to failures when `as_relational` is attempted.

#### Conclusion:
The issue resides with how `Contains.as_set()` is implemented, as it should return a set representation instead of a `Contains` object.

Buggy method: `sympy/sets/contains.py:Contains.as_set`

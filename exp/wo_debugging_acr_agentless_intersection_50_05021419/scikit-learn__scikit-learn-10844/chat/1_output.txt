To fix the issue, I need to examine the implementation details of the `fowlkes_mallows_score` function in `sklearn/metrics/cluster/supervised.py`. The line in question involves calculations that can lead to an overflow, and the proposed fix requires modifying this calculation.

I'll start by retrieving the implementation of the `fowlkes_mallows_score` method.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/metrics/cluster/supervised.py", "fowlkes_mallows_score")
```

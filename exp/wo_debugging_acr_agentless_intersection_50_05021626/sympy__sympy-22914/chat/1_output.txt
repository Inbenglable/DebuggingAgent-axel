To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code of the `PythonCodePrinter` class and understand its current implementation, particularly looking at other supported functions. This will help determine where and how to add the new methods `_print_Min` and `_print_Max`.

First, I'll search for the `PythonCodePrinter` class to locate its file path and examine its methods.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("PythonCodePrinter")
```

To resolve the issue, we need to ensure that we handle cases where the `support_vectors_` attribute is empty, which causes the division by zero in creating `dual_coef_indptr`. I'll introduce a check for the number of support vectors and handle the situation when it's zero to avoid the `ZeroDivisionError`.

Let's proceed with generating the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

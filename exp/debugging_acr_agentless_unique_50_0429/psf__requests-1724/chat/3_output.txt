Let's analyze the current observed code and the abnormal behavior.

### Analysis

- **Session.request method**
  This method constructs a `Request` object, prepares it, and sends it, returning a `Response` object. The snippet shows that the `method` parameter is passed directly to the `Request` object after converting it to uppercase using `method.upper()`. Since using a Unicode method string (`u'POST'`) causes an issue, the conversion may need more handling to avoid mixing character encodings incorrectly in Python 2.7.

- **Potential for encoding issues**
  Python 2.7 has a known issue with handling Unicode and non-Unicode strings, often leading to errors like `UnicodeDecodeError`. When `method.upper()` is called, it works fine with ASCII, but if `method` is Unicode, it could cause downstream encoding issues if not properly converted.

### Action

To identify the root cause, we should trace the process further down to see where the `method` string, once converted, interacts with other pieces of data that expect a specific string type. 

Given the stack trace, let's delve into how the `Request` object is prepared and interact with the `method` parameter further down. Specifically, we should look into how `prep = self.prepare_request(req)` processes the `method` string.

### Next Steps

Let's choose the scope around the preparation and sending of the request to trace further. We should check the preparation phase of the request to locate the possible encoding issue.

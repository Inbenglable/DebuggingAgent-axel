To determine whether the issue is resolved, let's review the provided information step-by-step:

1. **Issue Analysis**: 
   The original issue involves an invalid comparison of the complex number `I` in the function responsible for simplifying trigonometric expressions. This occurs because complex numbers cannot be compared directly using relational operators.

2. **Reproducible Test**: 
   The test provided captures the error by trying to simplify `cos(x)**I` and expecting an `AssertionError` because the complex comparison issue throws a `TypeError`. The test attempts to identify if the problem was fixed if it does not encounter an exception.

3. **Original Test Output**: 
   The original test output shows a `NameError` because `I` (the imaginary unit) was not defined in the testing script. This isn't related directly to the core issue but impacts the reproduction of the problem.

4. **Patch**: 
   The patch modifies the conditional checks in the relevant part of the Sympy code by adding checks to ensure that the comparisons are only made if `rv.exp` is both a number and real. This aims to resolve the TypeError.

5. **Patched Test Output**: 
   Despite the patch being applied, the test output remains unchanged because the `NameError` due to `I` not being defined in the test script. Therefore, the bug isn't reached/tested properly, which means the test setup itself is incorrect.

**Conclusion**: 
The patch seems logically correct in addressing the TypeError by ensuring comparisons are only made with real numbers. However, the test provided still inaccurately sets up the scenario needed to verify the fix due to the undefined `I`, so the intended verification of the patch effectiveness is not achieved via this test.

Thus, based on the test outputs provided (mainly due to inadequacies in the reproducible test), we cannot conclusively verify if the issue is resolved purely from this data. It appears the underlying issue in the code could be addressed, but the PR could not be properly tested due to the separate configuration issue (`NameError` for `I`).

Issue resolved: `False`

Based on the information provided and the snippet retrieved, the issue seems to involve correctly handling the metadata for proxy models. The solution requires replacing the direct metadata access with the concrete model metadata access to ensure compatibility with proxy models. Here is the patch in the SEARCH/REPLACE format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/sql/query.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                opts = cur_model._meta\n=======\n                opts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch replaces the direct metadata retrieval from `cur_model._meta` with `cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta`, ensuring that the concrete model's metadata is accessed when dealing with proxy models. This modification intends to resolve the crash issue without disrupting the existing functionality.

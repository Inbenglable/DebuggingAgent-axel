To resolve the issue, I need to identify the part of the Django source code responsible for generating migrations so that I can modify the import order logic. The logical step is to look for any methods or classes related to migration generation.

Since it's possible the migration generation logic may not be tied to a clearly defined method name, I may need to start by searching for relevant keywords related to migration generation in the codebase. 

I'll start by searching for the migration generation functionality within the Django codebase:

```python
search_code_in_codebase("generate migration")
search_code_in_codebase("migration import")
search_code_in_codebase("migrations import order")
```

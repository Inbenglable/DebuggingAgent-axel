To determine whether the issue is fixed, let's analyze the patch and the test outputs:

### Patch Analysis
The patch modifies the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file to enhance the handling of the `:private-members:` option. Specifically, it:

- Checks if `self.options.private_members` is a list.
- If it is, the patch filters private members by checking membership in this list.
- If it's not a list, the existing behavior remains, where a boolean flag directs the documentation of all private members.

### Test Output Comparison

#### Original Output
- The original test output confirms that all private members are being documented regardless of attempts to specify only certain ones.
- A critical error is present: `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '_build/html/index.html'`.

#### Patched Output
- The error persists in the patched output: `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '_build/html/index.html'`.
- Despite the intended changes in handling `:private-members:`, it appears the output is identical regarding documentation generation.

### Conclusion
Given that the crucial error preventing proper validation (missing HTML output) remains unaddressed, and the behavior concerning `:private-members:` appears unchanged due to this error, we cannot assert the feature was implemented and tested properly. The inability to generate the documentation output indicates a broader issue preventing the validation of the applied change.

Issue resolved: `False`

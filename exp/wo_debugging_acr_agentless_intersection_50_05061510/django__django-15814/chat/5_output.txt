Based on the provided issue, I am going to generate the patch in the *SEARCH/REPLACE* format to address the bug in the Django project relating to proxy model handling in queries.

```pythony
### django/db/models/sql/query.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
opts = cur_model._meta
=======
opts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This modification ensures that when working with proxy models, the query correctly retrieves metadata from the concrete model instead of the proxy, thereby preventing errors related to missing fields.

The final JSON which contains the edit is as follows:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/sql/query.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nopts = cur_model._meta\n=======\nopts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

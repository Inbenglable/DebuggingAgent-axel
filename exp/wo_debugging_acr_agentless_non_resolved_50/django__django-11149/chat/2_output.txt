To address the issue where admin inlines for auto-created `ManyToManyFields` are editable for users with only view permissions, I need to inspect the `TabularInline` class from the file `django/contrib/admin/options.py` to understand how permission checks are being handled.

I'll proceed by retrieving the source code of the `TabularInline` class to analyze how the current permission checks are implemented.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/contrib/admin/options.py", "TabularInline")
```

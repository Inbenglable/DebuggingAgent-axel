## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
ManagementUtility instantiates CommandParser without passing already-computed prog argument
Description
	
ManagementUtility ​goes to the trouble to parse the program name from the argv it's passed rather than from sys.argv: 
	def __init__(self, argv=None):
		self.argv = argv or sys.argv[:]
		self.prog_name = os.path.basename(self.argv[0])
		if self.prog_name == '__main__.py':
			self.prog_name = 'python -m django'
But then when it needs to parse --pythonpath and --settings, it ​uses the program name from sys.argv: 
		parser = CommandParser(usage='%(prog)s subcommand [options] [args]', add_help=False, allow_abbrev=False)
Above "%(prog)s" ​refers to sys.argv[0]. Instead, it should refer to self.prog_name. This can fixed as follows:
		parser = CommandParser(
			prog=self.prog_name,
			usage='%(prog)s subcommand [options] [args]',
			add_help=False,
			allow_abbrev=False)
I'm aware that execute_from_command_line is a private API, but it'd be really convenient for me if it worked properly in my weird embedded environment where sys.argv[0] is ​incorrectly None. If passing my own argv to execute_from_command_line avoided all the ensuing exceptions, I wouldn't have to modify sys.argv[0] globally as I'm doing in the meantime.

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue, I need the source code where the `ManagementUtility` class and its method are implemented, especially the part where it instantiates the `CommandParser`. Let's retrieve the necessary source code by searching for the `ManagementUtility` class and relevant method in the Django codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ManagementUtility")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_class_in_codebase("ManagementUtility")
RESULT:
#### django/core/management/__init__.py:ManagementUtility
```python
class ManagementUtility:
    """
    Encapsulate the logic of the django-admin and manage.py utilities.
    """
    def __init__(self, argv=None):
        ...

    def main_help_text(self, commands_only=False):
        ...

    def fetch_command(self, subcommand):
        ...

    def autocomplete(self):
        ...

    def execute(self):
        ...
```


==================================================

Your Output:
To fix the reported issue, I need to review the implementation details of the `ManagementUtility` class, specifically the method where `CommandParser` is instantiated with program name-related parameters. As the file path of the class is `django/core/management/__init__.py`, I will search for the method implementation in this file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/management/__init__.py", "execute")
search_method_in_file("django/core/management/__init__.py", "__init__")
```

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

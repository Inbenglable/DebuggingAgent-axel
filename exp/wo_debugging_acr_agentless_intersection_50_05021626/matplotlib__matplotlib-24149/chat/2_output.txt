To address the issue with handling `NaN` values in the `Axes.bar` method, it appears that the problem arises when converting x values using `_convert_dx`. The `_safe_first_finite` function fails to find any finite values, leading to the `StopIteration` exception.

To resolve this, I will first check the implementation of `_convert_dx` and `_safe_first_finite` methods to see how they handle or filter `NaN` values. This will guide us in handling such cases properly without raising an exception.

I'll proceed by retrieving the source code for both `_convert_dx` and `_safe_first_finite`.

```python
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py", "Axes._convert_dx")
search_method_in_codebase("_safe_first_finite")
```

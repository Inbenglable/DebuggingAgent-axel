Based on the code retrieved, we have enough information to implement the `get_antialiased` and `set_antialiased` methods for the `Text` class. We have identified the pattern for these methods from other classes like `Patch` and `Line2D`. We don't need additional source code to proceed with generating the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

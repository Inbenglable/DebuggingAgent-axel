Based on the results retrieved so far, I have gained insights into the `QuantityInput` class and its `as_decorator` method. However, I still need to look into the `__call__` method to understand how this decorator handles return annotations and where the problem with `NoneType` might be occurring. This will help me identify where to add a check for `NoneType`.
   
Therefore, I will search for the `__call__` method in the `QuantityInput` class to obtain its source code.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/units/decorators.py", "QuantityInput.__call__")
```

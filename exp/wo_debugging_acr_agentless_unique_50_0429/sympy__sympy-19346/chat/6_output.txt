I've already retrieved the necessary methods related to the `ReprPrinter` class. I now need to check whether there are specific methods for handling `dict` and `set` or if they need to be added. Since the `reprify` method is central to formatting elements, and the file already contains specific methods for handling lists (`_print_list`) and tuples (`_print_tuple`), it's likely that similar methods should exist or need to be created for `dict` and `set`. I will now retrieve `_print_dict` and `_print_set` methods, if they exist. Additionally, I will check for any set and dict related methods within the `ReprPrinter` class.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/repr.py", "ReprPrinter._print_dict")
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/repr.py", "ReprPrinter._print_set")
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/repr.py", "_print_dict")
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/repr.py", "_print_set")
search_code_in_file("sympy/printing/repr.py", "dict")
search_code_in_file("sympy/printing/repr.py", "set")
```

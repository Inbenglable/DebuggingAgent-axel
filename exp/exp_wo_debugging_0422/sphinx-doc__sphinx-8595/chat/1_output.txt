To address the issue, we need to handle the case where the `__all__` attribute is empty in the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` extension. I need to locate the correct section of the code in the Sphinx project where this attribute is processed. Typically, such work might be handled in a module related processing method or function. 

I will start by searching for the functions used in the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` extension.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("sphinx.ext.autodoc")
```

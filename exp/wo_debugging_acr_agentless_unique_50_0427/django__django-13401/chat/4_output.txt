To address the issue where abstract model fields should not be considered equal across different instantiated models, we need to modify the `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods of the `Field` class. Currently, these methods only consider the `creation_counter`, which leads to fields from different models being considered equal (and thus deduplicated if added to a set). To resolve this, we should incorporate the model information in these methods.

Here are the search/replace edits:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        # Needed for @total_ordering\n        if isinstance(other, Field):\n            return self.creation_counter == other.creation_counter\n        return NotImplemented\n=======\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        # Needed for @total_ordering\n        if isinstance(other, Field):\n            return self.creation_counter == other.creation_counter and self.model == other.model\n        return NotImplemented\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    def __hash__(self):\n        return hash(self.creation_counter)\n=======\n    def __hash__(self):\n        return hash((self.creation_counter, self.model))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    def __lt__(self, other):\n        # This is needed because bisect does not take a comparison function.\n        if isinstance(other, Field):\n            return self.creation_counter < other.creation_counter\n        return NotImplemented\n=======\n    def __lt__(self, other):\n        # This is needed because bisect does not take a comparison function.\n        if isinstance(other, Field):\n            if self.creation_counter != other.creation_counter:\n                return self.creation_counter < other.creation_counter\n            return self.model < other.model\n        return NotImplemented\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

These changes ensure that fields from different models are not mistakenly considered equal, which will prevent deduplication in scenarios like the one presented. By including the model comparison, we distinguish fields that may have the same `creation_counter` but belong to different models.

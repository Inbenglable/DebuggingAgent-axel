To fix the issue in the Django project, the error is occurring in the file `django/db/models/sql/query.py` around line 745 within some method where `cur_model._meta` is used. The proposed change is to replace it with `cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta`. Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code for the method in which this line exists to understand the context and ensure the patch is applied correctly.

To do this, I will search for the method in the specified file where the issue occurs. Since the exact method name is not provided, I will search for code surrounding line 745 in the file `django/db/models/sql/query.py` to locate the relevant method.

```python
search_code_in_file("django/db/models/sql/query.py", "opts = cur_model._meta")
```

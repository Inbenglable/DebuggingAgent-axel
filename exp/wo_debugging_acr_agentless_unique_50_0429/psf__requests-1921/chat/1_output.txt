To resolve this issue, we need to investigate how session headers are managed in the `requests` library. Specifically, we need to find where the headers are being set or modified in the `Session` class, as that's where the behavior needs to be adjusted to support setting a header value to `None`, which should prevent that header from being sent entirely.

Therefore, to understand what part of the code is responsible for handling session headers, I'll need to locate the `Session` class in the `requests` repository. Once we retrieve the source code for this class, we'll look for methods or code blocks that deal with setting or managing headers.

I'll proceed with searching for the `Session` class in the codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Session")
```

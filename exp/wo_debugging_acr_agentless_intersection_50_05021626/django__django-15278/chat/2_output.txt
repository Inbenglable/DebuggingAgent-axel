To resolve the issue, I need to understand how the `SQLiteSchemaEditor` class handles the addition of fields, specifically the `add_field` method. This class should be responsible for constructing and executing SQL commands, which likely include handling nullable fields and unique constraints.

I will search for the `SQLiteSchemaEditor` class to examine its implementation, especially its `add_field` method, which seems to be related to the issue.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("SQLiteSchemaEditor")
search_method_in_codebase("SQLiteSchemaEditor.add_field")
```

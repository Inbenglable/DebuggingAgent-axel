To resolve this issue, I need to review the source code for the `FileField` class, specifically looking at its `deconstruct` method. This will allow me to understand how the current implementation works and why it fails to include the callable for the `storage` argument when it returns `default_storage`.

I will start by locating the `FileField` class and then its `deconstruct` method.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("FileField")
search_method_in_codebase("FileField.deconstruct")
```

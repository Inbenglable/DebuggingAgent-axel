[Bug]: ConciseDateFormatter not showing year anywhere when plotting <12 months
### Bug summary

When I plot < 1 year and January is not included in the x-axis, the year doesn't show up anywhere.
This bug is different from bug #21670 (fixed in #21785).

### Code for reproduction

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.dates as mdates
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

#create time array
initial = datetime(2021,2,14,0,0,0)
time_array = [initial + timedelta(days=x) for x in range(1,200)]

#create data array
data = [-x**2/20000 for x in range(1,200)]


#plot data
fig,ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(time_array,data) 
        
locator = mdates.AutoDateLocator()
formatter = mdates.ConciseDateFormatter(locator)

ax.grid(True)
ax.set_ylabel("Temperature ($\degree$C)")
ax.xaxis.set_major_locator(locator)   
ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(formatter)
fig.autofmt_xdate() #automatically makes the x-labels rotate
```


### Actual outcome

### Expected outcome

I expect the year "2021" to show in the offset, to the right of the x-axis

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
```python
search_class_in_codebase("ConciseDateFormatter")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_class_in_codebase("ConciseDateFormatter")
RESULT:
#### lib/matplotlib/dates.py:ConciseDateFormatter
```python
class ConciseDateFormatter(ticker.Formatter):
    """
    A `.Formatter` which attempts to figure out the best format to use for the
    date, and to make it as compact as possible, but still be complete. This is
    most useful when used with the `AutoDateLocator`::

    >>> locator = AutoDateLocator()
    >>> formatter = ConciseDateFormatter(locator)

    Parameters
    ----------
    locator : `.ticker.Locator`
        Locator that this axis is using.

    tz : str or `~datetime.tzinfo`, default: :rc:`timezone`
        Passed to `.dates.num2date`.

    formats : list of 6 strings, optional
        Format strings for 6 levels of tick labelling: mostly years,
        months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.  Strings use
        the same format codes as `~datetime.datetime.strftime`.  Default is
        ``['%Y', '%b', '%d', '%H:%M', '%H:%M', '%S.%f']``

    zero_formats : list of 6 strings, optional
        Format strings for tick labels that are "zeros" for a given tick
        level.  For instance, if most ticks are months, ticks around 1 Jan 2005
        will be labeled "Dec", "2005", "Feb".  The default is
        ``['', '%Y', '%b', '%b-%d', '%H:%M', '%H:%M']``

    offset_formats : list of 6 strings, optional
        Format strings for the 6 levels that is applied to the "offset"
        string found on the right side of an x-axis, or top of a y-axis.
        Combined with the tick labels this should completely specify the
        date.  The default is::

            ['', '%Y', '%Y-%b', '%Y-%b-%d', '%Y-%b-%d', '%Y-%b-%d %H:%M']

    show_offset : bool, default: True
        Whether to show the offset or not.

    usetex : bool, default: :rc:`text.usetex`
        To enable/disable the use of TeX's math mode for rendering the results
        of the formatter.

    Examples
    --------
    See :doc:`/gallery/ticks/date_concise_formatter`

    .. plot::

        import datetime
        import matplotlib.dates as mdates

        base = datetime.datetime(2005, 2, 1)
        dates = np.array([base + datetime.timedelta(hours=(2 * i))
                          for i in range(732)])
        N = len(dates)
        np.random.seed(19680801)
        y = np.cumsum(np.random.randn(N))

        fig, ax = plt.subplots(constrained_layout=True)
        locator = mdates.AutoDateLocator()
        formatter = mdates.ConciseDateFormatter(locator)
        ax.xaxis.set_major_locator(locator)
        ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(formatter)

        ax.plot(dates, y)
        ax.set_title('Concise Date Formatter')

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

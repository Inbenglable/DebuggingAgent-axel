To resolve the issue, we need to examine the implementation of the `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension()` method. Since the issue exists in the internal method `_collect_factor_and_dimension` of the `SI` class, I need to retrieve the source code of this particular method. I'll search for this method within the codebase to review its implementation.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("SI._collect_factor_and_dimension")
```

You need to trace the abnormal program to resolve project issues and submit pull requests.
Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
inspect.signature() returns incorrect signature on manager methods.
Description
	 
		(last modified by Shiva Kumar)
	 
inspect.signature returns incorrect signature information when used on queryset methods
import inspect
from django.db import models
class Person(models.Model):
	name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
print(inspect.signature(Person.objects.bulk_create))
# actual: (*args, **kwargs)
# expected: (objs, batch_size=None, ignore_conflicts=False)
ipython and jupyter seem to internally use inspect.signature to show documentation when using the <obj>? command and they too show incorrect signature information:
 
The issue is due to the code at ​https://github.com/django/django/blob/fe2e1478464846638082219c933a4302e5cf3037/django/db/models/manager.py#L84
Although we are ensuring the decorated method has the right name and docstring on lines 87 and 88, complete metadata is not copied.
The fix is to use functools.wraps instead of manually assigning name and docstring. wraps will take care of all the metadata and inspect.signature will return the expected output.
If the bug is acknowledged please assign the ticket to me, I would like to raise a PR for this.

This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
The error message indicates that there is an "ImproperlyConfigured" exception occurring because the Django settings were not fully configured before accessing them. This is happening specifically when trying to create a new Django model class (`Person`) due to the interaction with the `apps.get_containing_app_config(module)` line.

Let's break down the situation based on the traceback:

- The setup is supposed to be configuring Django settings for testing, which is done in the `setup_django` function. This function calls `settings.configure()` with the required settings.

- The error occurs during the execution of `class Person(models.Model):`, when Django is trying to access the Django application registry with `apps.get_containing_app_config(module)` in the `ModelBase.__new__` method. This suggests that the settings have not been properly configured by this point in time.

The issue may arise from the order of operations within the script or an oversight in how/when `setup_django()` is being called or configured.

Since this is the primary issue causing the script not to run, I need to check further into the `setup_django` function to verify if `settings.configure` is being called correctly and if the settings are appropriate.

Observed method: `reproduce.py:setup_django`
==================================================
Based on the provided trace information, it appears the testing script is failing before determining the correctness of the `inspect.signature` output due to a configuration error in setting up the Django environment.

### Analysis of the Current Observed Code and Runtime Information:

1. **Code in `setup_django()`:** 
    - The function `setup_django()` is designed to manually configure Django settings for a test environment using an in-memory SQLite database and basic Django components.
    - `os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'reproducer')` is intended to set an environment variable for Django settings, but the value 'reproducer' does not correspond to any real settings module or file, potentially leading to a misconfiguration.
    - `settings.configure(...)` sets up necessary Django settings, but the missing line or incorrect order causing an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception might indicate either late configuration or missing application registration.
    - `django.setup()` is crucial as it initializes the Django application registry, but its effectiveness depends on the correctness of preceding settings.

2. **Error in Runtime Information:**
    - The assertion error in the runtime suggests that an expected file path was not found, which might result from misconfigured settings or from issues beyond Django setup.

### Observation Strategy:

To proceed, we need to delve deeper into the Django setup code to ensure configuration consistency and registration of installed applications. Issues often arise when the Django settings module is improperly set or when the app registry isn't fully registered.

### Next Steps:

- **Expand the code investigation into the Django application startup** to ensure correct app configurations and registrations have been completed.
  
- **Trace the code lines related to Django setup:** This can help verify whether applications are being correctly loaded, which is critical to ensure models and queries are accurately associated with the database and settings.

### Observed Scope to Further Investigate:

```plaintext
Observed scope: reproduce.py:21-35
```

This scope includes setting the environment variable and configuring the Django settings to observe how the setting configuration process and the invocation of `django.setup()` may contribute to potential misconfigurations or timing issues, and possibly locate the root cause of the abnormal program behavior.
==================================================
Based on the analysis of the current setup and the runtime information provided, it appears that the setup step for configuring Django in-memory settings is incomplete due to the lack of an appropriate app configuration in `INSTALLED_APPS`. The test setup relies on the in-memory database, and configuration should resemble closer an operational Django environment, including necessary built-in apps or custom apps that implement models.

To address the immediate issue, let's analyze:

### Analysis:

1. **Django Settings Configuration:**
    - The configuration for the Django environment mentions `INSTALLED_APPS` and `DATABASES` settings but only lists `django.contrib.contenttypes`. Typically, real Django projects include several other key apps such as `django.contrib.auth` or `django.contrib.admin`, which might be necessary for a functional environment.
    
2. **Stack Trace Information:**
    - The error seems localized in the testing setup script, with `ImproperlyConfigured` exception happening around the model instantiation due to missing app registration or faulty settings.
      
3. **Environment Variable Setup:**
    - The environment setting `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE='reproducer'` might be setting a placeholder rather than an actual settings module path, leading to inconsistencies when Django tries to access settings.

Given the incomplete settings, let's ensure that the necessary Django components are correctly included and initialized. This should include the addition of any missing primary app configuration relevant to model deployment.

### Next Steps:

The testing environment should resemble an actual Django setup, requiring at least minimally functional settings and applications for models to be properly instantiated. It would be helpful to further inspect how Django models interact with these settings components and whether augmenting these app configurations resolves the issue.

### Observing the Code:

To further hone in on the setup failure and inspect any overlooked discrepancies, the next step is to trace further setup entanglements within the Django settings and app registries during the initialization of the test environment.

```plaintext
Observed method: reproduce.py:main
```

By examining the `main` method, we can see the exact point where the failure occurs as the model `Person` interacts with the database settings. This method will help verify if the configured settings remain consistent when interfacing with Django's app registry and establishing model connections.
==================================================
### Analysis of the Current Observed Code and Abnormal Program Behavior:

1. **Main Method Functionality:**
   - The main function tries to obtain the signature of `bulk_create` from `Person.objects` using `inspect.signature`.
   - It then attempts to assert that the obtained signature matches an expected signature.
   - If the assertion fails, an `AssertionError` is raised and the stack trace is printed.
   - There's no observed interaction with the database or settings in this method; it focuses solely on function signature validation.

2. **Runtime Error:**
   - The runtime information indicates an `AssertionError`, but not directly related to the code logic in `main()`.
   - The error arises in the `tracer.py` file of the debug tool (`dbgsnooper.snoop`), which seems unrelated to Django testing logic but affects the invocation of the testing script.

3. **Scope of the Issue:**
   - While the signature validation logic is straightforward, the test setup involving Django's environment, including `settings.configure` and the app initialization `django.setup()`, might need further attention.
   - The immediate runtime error suggests more focus should be on correctly configuring and initializing the testing environment.

Based on this analysis, the runtime error doesn't directly pertain to the `main()` method's immediate logic but rather reflects the testing script execution context. Further observation is needed to guarantee Django's settings and apps are fully configured before signature validation.

### Next Steps:

Given the focus on establishing the necessary environment before `main()` can execute without failure, let's continue the tracing from the `setup_django()` method, which is responsible for configuring this environment.

```plaintext
Observed scope: reproduce.py:21-35
```

This scope includes configuration of Django settings via `setup_django`. It's crucial for ensuring the test setup mirrors the foundational requirements of a Django project, correcting misconfigurations that currently affect environment initialization. Let's trace and verify the configuration completeness and assess how it ties with `main()` execution.
==================================================
### Analysis of the Current Observed Code and Abnormal Program Behavior:

1. **Code in `setup_django()`:**
   - The setup for Django's in-memory test environment is configured using `os.environ.setdefault` and `settings.configure`.
   - `INSTALLED_APPS` includes only `'django.contrib.contenttypes'`, essential for Django model operation but potentially insufficient for complete environment functionality.
   - Uses an in-memory SQLite database which should be fine for testing purposes.
   - The `django.setup()` call is intended to initialize the app registry, which is crucial for model loading and query execution.

2. **Runtime Error:**
   - The traceback provided points to an `AssertionError` in the debugging tool's tracer code (`dbgsnooper.snoop`), indicating a potential misalignment when file path verifications were performed during debugging, but this doesn't directly involve the test logic itself.
   - This runtime error seems external to the logic of setting up Django and more about the test environment and flakiness in the debugger tool's setup or application.

3. **Connection to Observed Code:**
   - The settings appear typical for basic Django function tests but might require additional built-in apps such as `django.contrib.auth` or similar, depending on later interactively required dependencies.

Given the inability of current settings to correctly establish the Django environment that eventually is able to assert `Person.objects.bulk_create` signature properly, continued responsibility confirmation of the configuration is necessary.

### Next Steps:

To guarantee that Django's app configuration does not miss crucial elements potentially needed for model method operations:

```plaintext
Observed method: reproduce.py:main
```

Reviewing the `main()` method is vital to better verify the validity of tested assumptions against `bulk_create` and ensure it's not erroneous through external factors. This will clarify if the setup suffices once the method execution environment stabilizes or if additional setup configurations need inclusion.
==================================================
### Analysis of the Current Observed Code and Abnormal Program Behavior:

1. **Observed Code:**
   - The `main()` function retrieves the signature of the `bulk_create` method and compares it to an expected value.
   - This involves Django models and introspection using Python's `inspect` module.
   - In case of mismatches, an `AssertionError` is raised, indicating the signature does not match expectations.

2. **Runtime Information:**
   - The provided trace indicates an `AssertionError` occurring in a debugging tool's tracer code (`dbgsnooper.snoop`).
   - This error is due to an assertion checking file path existence, which is separate from the Django application's logic.

3. **Issue Characteristics:**
   - The error suggests a path resolution issue in the testing environment or debugging setup rather than a logical error within the `main()` function or Django configuration directly.
   - This setup error preempts the actual check of the `bulk_create` method's signature.

4. **Potential Areas for Addressing:**
   - Review the file path configurations and the environment/setup being used to run the test and interact with the debugging tool.
   - Ensure the relevant Django settings and configurations have been initialized completely and accurately, especially if other apps or settings are needed for the given configuration to correctly introspect models.

Given the external nature of the error—specifically related to file paths in the testing framework—it seems more systemic to the interaction between the test tool and the given script's execution. Thus, the immediate focus should be on ensuring environmental or setup inconsistencies are mitigated before confirming if the core Django setup test meets expectations.

### Next Steps:
Given the external nature of the current error:

Observed scope: `reproduce.py:21-35`

By refining this setup phase, clarity over the existing Django model environment will be improved, ensuring settings and any necessary migrations or app integrations support the introspection used in `main()`. Addressing missing components or dependencies in setup could lead to resolving these preemptive errors.
==================================================
### Analysis of the Current Observed Code and Abnormal Program Behavior

1. **Code in `setup_django()`:**
   - This code initializes the Django environment for testing purposes.
   - It uses `os.environ.setdefault` to set `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` to `'reproducer'`, which usually refers to a settings module, but it appears more as a placeholder.
   - `settings.configure()` is called with minimal required settings, including a single installed app (`django.contrib.contenttypes`) and an in-memory SQLite database, but this setup may be insufficient for complete Django environments.
   - `django.setup()` finalizes the configuration by initializing the Django application registry.

2. **Runtime Information:**
   - The error occurs due to an `AssertionError` within a debugging tool (`dbgsnooper.snoop`) that checks for the existence of a file path, rather than directly within the Django setup.
   - This assertion failure is unrelated to the Django configuration logic but instead relates to the environment and execution context of the testing/debugging framework.

3. **Key Takeaways:**
   - The Django setup logic seems standard for a minimal test, but the reliance on such limited apps and settings might not cover additional implicit dependencies required by Django.
   - The core error arises outside typical Django logic, suggesting an external file path or setup misalignment within the testing tool's configuration.

### Conclusion:
The immediate problem affecting runtime exceeds Django's setup and involves the test or debug framework. This systemic issue regarding file path configuration within the tool disrupts the proper test execution, which must be addressed before diagnostics of Django configurations can meaningfully continue.

Given that the issue identified stems from the test tool, examine the broader context of the testing script environment or debug setup beyond the `setup_django` method itself for misconfigurations or placeholder files.

### Next Steps:
Address the test/debug environment by observing broader interactions or initializations within the script that invoke the `snoop` tool and file checks.

```plaintext
Observed method: reproduce.py:print_stacktrace
```

This method can identify the logging route capturing errors during setup/environment calls, helping understand debug assertions affecting our runtime without direct connection to Django setup functions.

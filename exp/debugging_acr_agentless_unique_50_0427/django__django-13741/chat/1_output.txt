The current observed code snippet imports the `django` module and attempts to run `django.setup()`. This requires Django settings to be properly configured. The error message indicates that the script tries to set the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable to `'test_settings'`, but there is no module named `'test_settings'`, resulting in a `ModuleNotFoundError`.

This is causing the initial setup of Django to fail because it cannot find a settings module, which is necessary for configuring Django before using its components, such as models and forms.

Considering the error and where it originates from in the traceback:

- The error occurs during the `django.setup()` call, which is part of the script to configure Django.
- The missing `'test_settings'` module is the root cause of the error, preventing Django from initializing properly.

Before moving directly to the buggy method to implement the fix regarding the disabled property, we must first resolve the testing environment issue using appropriate settings.

Observed method: `django/conf/__init__.py:LazySettings._setup`

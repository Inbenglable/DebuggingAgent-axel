To address the issue, I need to examine the source code of the `add_fields` method within the `django/forms/formsets.py` file. This will enable me to identify the specific line of code that requires modification. 

I'll proceed with retrieving the method source code.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/forms/formsets.py", "BaseFormSet.add_fields")
```

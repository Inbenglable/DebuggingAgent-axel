Based on the description of the issue and the provided traceback, we are looking for the `_sparse_fit` method in the context of support vector machine (SVM) implementation in scikit-learn. Let's analyze the provided contents:

1. **sklearn/impute/_base.py:SimpleImputer._sparse_fit**
   - This method is related to the `SimpleImputer` class, which deals with imputation strategies for missing data on sparse matrices. It is not related to SVMs, so it's irrelevant.

2. **sklearn/svm/base.py:BaseLibSVM._sparse_fit**
   - This method is directly related to SVMs in the `BaseLibSVM` class and operates on sparse matrices. It handles the fitting process of SVMs using sparse data, which makes it relevant to the issue at hand.

3. **sklearn/preprocessing/data.py:QuantileTransformer._sparse_fit**
   - This method pertains to the `QuantileTransformer` class, which is used for scaling and transforming features using quantiles. It is not related to SVMs, so it's irrelevant.

Hence, the relevant method related to the issue of SVMs with empty support_vectors_ is:

```
sklearn/svm/base.py:BaseLibSVM._sparse_fit
```

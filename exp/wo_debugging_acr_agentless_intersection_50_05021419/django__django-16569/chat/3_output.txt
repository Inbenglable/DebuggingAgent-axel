Here is the patch to resolve the issue in *django/forms/formsets.py*:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/forms/formsets.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or index < initial_form_count):\n=======\n        if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or (index is not None and index < initial_form_count)):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch addresses the issue by ensuring that the comparison involving `index` only takes place if `index` is not `None`.

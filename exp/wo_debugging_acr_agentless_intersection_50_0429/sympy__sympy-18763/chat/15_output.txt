Here's a patch to address the incorrect parenthesizing issue of `Subs` in LaTeX output within the Sympy project. The patch will modify the `_print_Subs` method in the `sympy/printing/latex.py` file to ensure proper parenthesizing:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/printing/latex.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        return r'\\left. %s \\right|_{\\substack{ %s }}' % (latex_expr,\n                                                         latex_subs)\n=======\n        return r'\\left. \\left(%s\\right) \\right|_{\\substack{ %s }}' % (latex_expr,\n                                                         latex_subs)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch wraps the expression part (`latex_expr`) of the `Subs` in parentheses within the LaTeX string, solving the parenthesizing issue as described in the Sympy project issue report.

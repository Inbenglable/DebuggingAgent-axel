The issue arises when a structured numpy array is added to an Astropy Table. The problem is that the array is automatically being transformed into an `NdarrayMixin`, which is not desired. Based on the analysis, the part of the code responsible for this transformation occurs in the `_convert_data_to_col` method, specifically in this block:

```python
if (not isinstance(data, Column) and not data_is_mixin
        and isinstance(data, np.ndarray) and len(data.dtype) > 1):
    data = data.view(NdarrayMixin)
    data_is_mixin = True
```

Here, if the data is a structured numpy array and not already a mixin or a `Column`, it gets modified to be viewed as an `NdarrayMixin`.

Given that this is where the transformation happens and aligns with the issue description, we have identified the root cause of the problem. The method that requires modification is `_convert_data_to_col`.

Thus, the buggy method is:
Buggy method: `astropy/table/table.py:_convert_data_to_col`

To address the incorrect parenthesizing of the `Subs` expressions in LaTeX output, we need to modify the `_print_Subs` method in the `LatexPrinter` class to ensure that the expression part of the `Subs` is enclosed within parentheses before being substituted. Here's the patch:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/printing/latex.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        return r'\\left. %s \\right|_{\\substack{ %s }}' % (latex_expr,\n=======\n        return r'\\left. \\left(%s\\right) \\right|_{\\substack{ %s }}' % (latex_expr,\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch encloses `latex_expr` within additional parentheses, ensuring the overall expression in the `Subs` is correctly parenthesized in the LaTeX output.

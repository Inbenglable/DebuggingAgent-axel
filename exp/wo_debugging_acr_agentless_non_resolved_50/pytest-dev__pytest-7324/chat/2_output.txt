To address the issue, I need to understand the full implementation of the `Expression.compile` method. This method needs to be modified to prevent the crash on a debug build by handling the specific case where an expression like "False" is compiled. Currently, I've located the method in the `src/_pytest/mark/expression.py` file, but I haven't yet retrieved the full implementation of the method's code. 

Let's retrieve the source code for the `Expression.compile` method.

```python
search_method_in_file("src/_pytest/mark/expression.py", "Expression.compile")
```

The issue appears to be related to how the stdout/stderr flushing is managed within the `migrate` command. We have retrieved the `handle` method from `django/core/management/commands/migrate.py` which shows how migration plans are executed using `MigrationExecutor.migrate`.

To generate the patch, I need to inspect how output is being printed and how flushing could be affected during this process, especially in the `Command.handle` method in `migrate.py`. There might be a need to ensure that outputs are flushed at certain key points.

I need to retrieve the `flush()` method usage details from `migrate.py` to complete this understanding.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/management/commands/migrate.py", "flush")
```

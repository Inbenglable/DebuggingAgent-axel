Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions
I am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.

See the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.

Sympy version: 1.8.dev

```python
from sympy import *
from sympy.core.cache import clear_cache

x, y, z = symbols('x y z')

clear_cache()
expr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))
# This works fine
expr.subs({1: 1.0})

clear_cache()
x, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)
expr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))
# This fails with "PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense"
expr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error
# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error
expr.subs({1: 1.0})
```

I am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-

- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds
- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`
- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)
- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)

Not too sure how to debug this one.

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:

This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
To start diagnosing the issue, we should first inspect the execution path leading to the `PolynomialError`. Based on the code involved in the error, it most likely relates to the execution path when substitutions occur alongside specific function compositions like `exp`, `sinh`, and `Piecewise`.

Let's begin by examining the method that triggers the `PolynomialError` during the substitution process when the expression involves `Piecewise`. The method responsible for handling substitutions in expressions is typically linked to `Expr.subs` or methods dealing with symbolic manipulations involving polynomials.

Next, it is essential to analyze how the polynomial tools interact with `Piecewise` expressions because the error message "Piecewise generators do not make sense" suggests an issue with polynomial generation from a `Piecewise` expression. Thus, the focus should be on methods invoked within `subs` that attempt polynomial manipulations.

Observed method: `sympy/core/basic.py:Basic.subs`
==================================================


Now you choose downstream method Basic.subs to further observe, tracing the abnormal program behavior.
This is the method code:
   761	    def subs(self, *args, **kwargs):
   762	        """
   763	        Substitutes old for new in an expression after sympifying args.
   764	
   765	        `args` is either:
   766	          - two arguments, e.g. foo.subs(old, new)
   767	          - one iterable argument, e.g. foo.subs(iterable). The iterable may be
   768	             o an iterable container with (old, new) pairs. In this case the
   769	               replacements are processed in the order given with successive
   770	               patterns possibly affecting replacements already made.
   771	             o a dict or set whose key/value items correspond to old/new pairs.
   772	               In this case the old/new pairs will be sorted by op count and in
   773	               case of a tie, by number of args and the default_sort_key. The
   774	               resulting sorted list is then processed as an iterable container
   775	               (see previous).
   776	
   777	        If the keyword ``simultaneous`` is True, the subexpressions will not be
   778	        evaluated until all the substitutions have been made.
   779	
   780	        Examples
   781	        ========
   782	
   783	        >>> from sympy import pi, exp, limit, oo
   784	        >>> from sympy.abc import x, y
   785	        >>> (1 + x*y).subs(x, pi)
   786	        pi*y + 1
   787	        >>> (1 + x*y).subs({x:pi, y:2})
   788	        1 + 2*pi
   789	        >>> (1 + x*y).subs([(x, pi), (y, 2)])
   790	        1 + 2*pi
   791	        >>> reps = [(y, x**2), (x, 2)]
   792	        >>> (x + y).subs(reps)
   793	        6
   794	        >>> (x + y).subs(reversed(reps))
   795	        x**2 + 2
   796	
   797	        >>> (x**2 + x**4).subs(x**2, y)
   798	        y**2 + y
   799	
   800	        To replace only the x**2 but not the x**4, use xreplace:
   801	
   802	        >>> (x**2 + x**4).xreplace({x**2: y})
   803	        x**4 + y
   804	
   805	        To delay evaluation until all substitutions have been made,
   806	        set the keyword ``simultaneous`` to True:
   807	
   808	        >>> (x/y).subs([(x, 0), (y, 0)])
   809	        0
   810	        >>> (x/y).subs([(x, 0), (y, 0)], simultaneous=True)
   811	        nan
   812	
   813	        This has the added feature of not allowing subsequent substitutions
   814	        to affect those already made:
   815	
   816	        >>> ((x + y)/y).subs({x + y: y, y: x + y})
   817	        1
   818	        >>> ((x + y)/y).subs({x + y: y, y: x + y}, simultaneous=True)
   819	        y/(x + y)
   820	
   821	        In order to obtain a canonical result, unordered iterables are
   822	        sorted by count_op length, number of arguments and by the
   823	        default_sort_key to break any ties. All other iterables are left
   824	        unsorted.
   825	
   826	        >>> from sympy import sqrt, sin, cos
   827	        >>> from sympy.abc import a, b, c, d, e
   828	
   829	        >>> A = (sqrt(sin(2*x)), a)
   830	        >>> B = (sin(2*x), b)
   831	        >>> C = (cos(2*x), c)
   832	        >>> D = (x, d)
   833	        >>> E = (exp(x), e)
   834	
   835	        >>> expr = sqrt(sin(2*x))*sin(exp(x)*x)*cos(2*x) + sin(2*x)
   836	
   837	        >>> expr.subs(dict([A, B, C, D, E]))
   838	        a*c*sin(d*e) + b
   839	
   840	        The resulting expression represents a literal replacement of the
   841	        old arguments with the new arguments. This may not reflect the
   842	        limiting behavior of the expression:
   843	
   844	        >>> (x**3 - 3*x).subs({x: oo})
   845	        nan
   846	
   847	        >>> limit(x**3 - 3*x, x, oo)
   848	        oo
   849	
   850	        If the substitution will be followed by numerical
   851	        evaluation, it is better to pass the substitution to
   852	        evalf as
   853	
   854	        >>> (1/x).evalf(subs={x: 3.0}, n=21)
   855	        0.333333333333333333333
   856	
   857	        rather than
   858	
   859	        >>> (1/x).subs({x: 3.0}).evalf(21)
   860	        0.333333333333333314830
   861	
   862	        as the former will ensure that the desired level of precision is
   863	        obtained.

## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Meta.ordering fields must not be included in GROUP BY clause
Description
	
This continues (closed) [1] ticket.
I beleave it was not properly fixed in commit [0ddb4ebf].
While commit [0ddb4ebf] removes ORDER BY when Meta.ordering is used it still does populates GROUP BY with Meta.ordering fields thus leads to wrong aggregation.
PR with test case was added at [2].

</ISSUE>


In the previous round, you called search APIs to retrieve relevant source code that would help identify the root cause of the issue and generate a patch. However, the code you retrieved appears in multiple locations (maybe some are irrelevant but have same key). So now your task is to determine which of the retrieved contents are indeed you need, and filter out the irrelevant ones.
This is your API invocation round output:
To address the issue regarding the inappropriate inclusion of `Meta.ordering` fields in the `GROUP BY` clause, I need to locate and potentially modify the code responsible for query generation, particularly where the `Meta.ordering` might be affecting the `GROUP BY` clause.

As a starting point, I should retrieve the existing implementation related to query construction, focusing on how the `Meta.ordering` interacts with `GROUP BY`. This will likely involve examining the ORM components within Django, such as the queryset or query generation logic in the `Query` or `QuerySet` classes.

I'll proceed by retrieving relevant source code to identify the specific points where changes might be required.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Query")
search_class_in_codebase("QuerySet")
search_method_in_codebase("add_fields")
search_method_in_codebase("add_ordering")
```

And this is the corresponding API returned result (each content is started with #### FILE_PATH:NAME):

Among the API returned contents, there may be some irrelevant ones or not. So now you need to analyze each returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.
Now, please first analyze the API returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.

Then you need to choose you needed ones with the following format:
```
FILE_PATH_1:NAME_1
FILE_PATH_2:NAME_2
...
```

Note:
1. The value of FILE_PATH:NAME, must consistent with the API returned content (but remove the prefix ####).
2. You may select one or more contents, or even all of them if they are indeed you need.

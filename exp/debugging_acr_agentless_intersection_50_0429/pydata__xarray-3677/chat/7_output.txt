Issue resolved: `True`

The patch addresses the issue by ensuring that when the `ds.merge()` method is called with a `DataArray` as argument, the `DataArray` is first converted to a `Dataset`. The original output indicated a failure due to an `AttributeError` because the `DataArray` was not being handled correctly. After applying the patch, this error no longer appears, and the operation executes successfully, as evidenced by the patched output matching the expected result: a merged dataset containing both `a` and `b`. The success of the operation indicates that the issue has been resolved.

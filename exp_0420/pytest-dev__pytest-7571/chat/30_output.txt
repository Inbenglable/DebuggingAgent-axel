Based on our ongoing tracing and analysis, we have a good understanding that the `LogCaptureFixture._finalize` method is supposed to restore the log levels but it seems the `_initial_logger_levels` dictionary might not be getting populated as expected at the start of the test.

From the `LogCaptureFixture.__init__` method, we see that `_initial_logger_levels` is an empty dictionary when the fixture is initialized. This dictionary is supposed to store the initial log levels before any changes so that they can be restored later.

The next step to identify the root cause is to check how and when `_initial_logger_levels` is populated with the initial log levels. Given that changing log levels interactively via `caplog.set_level()` is a common scenario, we should inspect how `set_level` method interacts with `_initial_logger_levels`.

Letâ€™s look deeper into the `set_level` method implementation of `LogCaptureFixture` to verify how the initial log levels are recorded.

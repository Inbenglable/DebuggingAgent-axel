Issue resolved: `True`

The patch addresses the problem by adding a condition to handle cases where `n_SV` is zero. Specifically, it sets `self.dual_coef_` to an empty sparse matrix with the shape `(n_class, 0)` when `n_SV` is zero, thus preventing the division by zero error that originally occurred. The test output after applying the patch is empty, indicating that the code executed successfully without errors, confirming that the issue is resolved.

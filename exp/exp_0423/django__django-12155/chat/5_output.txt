To fix the issue in the `trim_docstring` function, we'll adjust the calculation of `indent` to exclude the first line of the docstring when determining the minimal indentation. This will prevent errors when the first line is not empty and doesn't have leading spaces.

Here's the patch in a SEARCH/REPLACE format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())\n=======\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch correctly skips the first line of the docstring while calculating the minimum indentation, resolving the issue as described.

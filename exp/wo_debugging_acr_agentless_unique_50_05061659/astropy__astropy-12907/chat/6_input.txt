This is the bug issue, which is in the **astropy** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Modeling's `separability_matrix` does not compute separability correctly for nested CompoundModels
Consider the following model:

```python
from astropy.modeling import models as m
from astropy.modeling.separable import separability_matrix

cm = m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)
```

It's separability matrix as you might expect is a diagonal:

```python
>>> separability_matrix(cm)
array([[ True, False],
       [False,  True]])
```

If I make the model more complex:
```python
>>> separability_matrix(m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5))
array([[ True,  True, False, False],
       [ True,  True, False, False],
       [False, False,  True, False],
       [False, False, False,  True]])
```

The output matrix is again, as expected, the outputs and inputs to the linear models are separable and independent of each other.

If however, I nest these compound models:
```python
>>> separability_matrix(m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm)
array([[ True,  True, False, False],
       [ True,  True, False, False],
       [False, False,  True,  True],
       [False, False,  True,  True]])
```
Suddenly the inputs and outputs are no longer separable?

This feels like a bug to me, but I might be missing something?

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
## REPRODUCE TEST
```
import traceback
import sys
from astropy.modeling import models as m
from astropy.modeling.separable import separability_matrix

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Define the models
    cm = m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)
    nested_cm = m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm

    # Expected separability matrix for the nested compound model
    expected_matrix = [
        [True, True, False, False],
        [True, True, False, False],
        [False, False, True, False],
        [False, False, False, True]
    ]

    # Get the actual separability matrix
    actual_matrix = separability_matrix(nested_cm)

    # Check if the actual matrix matches the expected matrix
    try:
        assert (actual_matrix == expected_matrix).all(), "Separability matrix does not match the expected output."
        print("The issue is fixed. Exiting with code 0.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

And this is the original output when running the test (before applying the patch):
## ORIGINAL OUTPUT

The repair agent has tried to generate a patch to fix the issue:
## PATCH CONTEXT
<PATCH_CONTEXT>
To address the issue of incorrect computation of the separability matrix for nested compound models in Astropy, we will make modifications to the `_separable` function logic.

The issue arises because the separability calculation does not account properly for nested compound models. Particularly, we need to refine how we compute separability for nested `CompoundModel` instances by ensuring that the separability of nested models respects the hierarchy correctly, adjusting how matrices are combined.

By changing the way compound model separabilities are computed, we ensure that the boolean matrix is calculated accurately even in nested scenarios.

Here is the patch for the fix:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### astropy/modeling/separable.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        return _operators[transform.op](sepleft, sepright)\n=======\n        op_func = _operators[transform.op]\n        comp_matrix = op_func(sepleft, sepright)\n        # Ensure the compound matrix accounts for nested structure\n        if transform.n_inputs > sepleft.shape[1]:\n            left_matrix = np.zeros((sepleft.shape[0], transform.n_inputs), dtype=bool)\n            right_matrix = np.zeros((sepright.shape[0], transform.n_inputs), dtype=bool)\n            left_matrix[..., :sepleft.shape[1]] = sepleft\n            right_matrix[..., -sepright.shape[1]:] = sepright\n            comp_matrix = op_func(left_matrix, right_matrix)\n        return comp_matrix\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Original Logic:**
   - The original logic combined the separability matrices of the left and right submodels directly using `_operators`.

2. **Enhanced Logic:**
   - Added extra logic to create a `left_matrix` and `right_matrix` with dimensions matching the parent transform when the parent has more inputs, ensuring the matrices fit correctly within nested layers.
   - This ensures that the separability is checked accurately, including how nested models might change the dependencies between inputs and outputs. 

This patch improves the accuracy of the separability matrix, particularly for nested compound models, by making sure that the correct dimensions and relations are considered when computing separable matrices from nested models.

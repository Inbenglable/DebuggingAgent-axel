To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve more information on how the `__all__` attribute is processed within the relevant code, most likely in the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` module itself. I need to explore how it handles the selection of members within modules, particularly focusing on how it deals with the `__all__` attribute.

Given the previous search results regarding `ModuleScanner`, I should check the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` directory specifically for code related to scanning modules or dealing with member selection of modules which might be connected to `ModuleScanner`.

Let me start by searching for any method handling `__all__` related processing in the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` module or other closely related sections.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("AutodocReporter.get_result")
search_method_in_codebase("Documenter.analyze_module")
```
These searches aim to find the methods that might have a direct influence on the documentation generation based on module member attributes. Once this is retrieved, more clarity on the matter can be achieved.

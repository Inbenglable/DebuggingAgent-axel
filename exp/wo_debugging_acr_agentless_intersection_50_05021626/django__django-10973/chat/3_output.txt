To address the issue, I need to modify the `runshell` method in `django.db.backends.postgresql.client`. I found the method signature but I need to retrieve the full source code for this method to understand how it handles subprocess execution. This will allow me to introduce the necessary changes using `subprocess.run` and `PGPASSWORD`. 

I will search for the method `runshell_db` as it seems to be the method that actually handles the database client connection.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py", "runshell_db")
```

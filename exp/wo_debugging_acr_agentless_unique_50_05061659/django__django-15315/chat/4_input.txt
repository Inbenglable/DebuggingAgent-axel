You are a PR reviewer that needs to review the patch generated by a bug repair agent and determine whether the issue is fixed or not.
This is the bug issue, which is in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Model Field.__hash__() should be immutable.
Description
	
Field.__hash__ changes value when a field is assigned to a model class.
This code crashes with an AssertionError:
from django.db import models
f = models.CharField(max_length=200)
d = {f: 1}
class Book(models.Model):
	title = f
assert f in d
The bug was introduced in #31750.
It's unlikely to have been encountered because there are few use cases to put a field in a dict *before* it's assigned to a model class. But I found a reason to do so whilst implementing #26472 and the behaviour had me stumped for a little.
IMO we can revert the __hash__ change from #31750. Objects with the same hash are still checked for equality, which was fixed in that ticket. But it's bad if an object's hash changes, since it breaks its use in dicts.

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
## REPRODUCE TEST
```
from django.db import models
import traceback
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    f = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    d = {f: 1}
    class Book(models.Model):
        title = f
    try:
        assert f in d
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

And this is the original output when running the test (before applying the patch):

```

The repair agent has tried to generate a patch to fix the issue:
## PATCH CONTEXT
<PATCH_CONTEXT>
To address the issue, I will revise the `Field.__hash__()` method to eliminate its dependency on mutable elements that may change during the field's lifecycle. Specifically, I will modify the hash method to only utilize the `creation_counter`, which remains unchanged after the field has been instantiated.

Here is the modification using the *SEARCH/REPLACE* format for the patch:

```pythony
### django/db/models/fields/__init__.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def __hash__(self):
        return hash((
            self.creation_counter,
            self.model._meta.app_label if hasattr(self, 'model') else None,
            self.model._meta.model_name if hasattr(self, 'model') else None,
        ))
=======
    def __hash__(self):
        return hash(self.creation_counter)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the hash value of a `Field` object remains constant, even after it has been assigned to a `Model`.

Now, I will provide the edit in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    def __hash__(self):\n        return hash((\n            self.creation_counter,\n            self.model._meta.app_label if hasattr(self, 'model') else None,\n            self.model._meta.model_name if hasattr(self, 'model') else None,\n        ))\n=======\n    def __hash__(self):\n        return hash(self.creation_counter)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```
</PATCH_CONTEXT>

After applying the patch, the output of the test is:

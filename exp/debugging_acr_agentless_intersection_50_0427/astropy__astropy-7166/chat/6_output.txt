The patch aims to address the issue of the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass not handling property docstrings by modifying the `__init__` method. It adds a check for properties, in addition to functions, and updates the properties in the derived class if a docstring is found in the base class.

Reviewing the test output:

### Original Output
The original output indicates an `AssertionError` because the property docstring is not inherited. This confirms that the bug exists, as the intended functionality is to inherit docstrings for properties as well as methods.

### Patched Output
The patched output shows an `IndentationError`. This indicates a syntactic issue in the code, suggesting that the patch did not apply correctly.

The failed test due to the `IndentationError` confirms that the patch is not syntactically correct, and thus cannot be executed as intended to resolve the issue.

### Conclusion
The issue is not resolved as the patch introduced a syntactic error, leading to an `IndentationError` when running the test. The intended functionality of inheriting property docstrings was not tested due to this error.

Issue resolved: `False`

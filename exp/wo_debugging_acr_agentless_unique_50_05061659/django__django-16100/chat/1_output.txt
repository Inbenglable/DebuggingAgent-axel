To address the issue of adding transaction handling to the `changelist_view` in Django admin, I need to review the source code of the `changelist_view` method. This will help identify the exact changes required to add transaction management.

Since I'm not provided with the file path, I will need to search for the method in the codebase:

```python
search_method_in_codebase("changelist_view")
```

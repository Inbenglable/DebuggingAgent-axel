I need to retrieve the source code for the `_print_Subs` method in the `LatexPrinter` class within the `sympy/printing/latex.py` file, as this method is responsible for printing `Subs` objects in LaTeX format. Let's obtain the method's source code:

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/latex.py", "LatexPrinter._print_Subs")
```

The observed code is attempting to run a Django migration that adds a nullable `OneToOneField` using SQLite as the database backend. However, during execution, the code crashes with the following error:

```
AttributeError: module 'django.db.migrations' has no attribute 'OneToOneField'
```

The root cause of this error is a misunderstanding of how Django migrations work. In Django migrations, field definitions should use the models module for field types, not the migrations module. The error occurs because the code is trying to access `OneToOneField` from `django.db.migrations`, which does not exist. The correct approach is to use the `models.OneToOneField` from `django.db`.

Now, let's identify the specific method where this error is present. The error occurs in the migration class definition where the field is being defined.

Buggy method: `test_app/migrations/0001_initial.py:Migration`

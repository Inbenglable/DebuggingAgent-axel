Issue resolved: `False`

The patch applied attempted to address the deprecation warnings by modifying type casting for arrays, however, the test output before and after applying the patch remains identical. The deprecation warnings regarding the conversion of out-of-bound Python integers to integer arrays in NumPy persist. This indicates that the changes did not address the core issue causing these warnings. The error logs and assertion failures still appear after the patch is applied, meaning the bug is still present and unresolved.

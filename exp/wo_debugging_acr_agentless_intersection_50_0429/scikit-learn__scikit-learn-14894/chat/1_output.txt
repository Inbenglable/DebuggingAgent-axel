To properly address this issue, I should obtain the source code for the `_sparse_fit` method in the SVM module since the error occurs there. I need to examine how the ZeroDivisionError is triggered and determine how to handle cases where the `support_vectors_` attribute is empty.

I'll start by searching for the `_sparse_fit` method in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("_sparse_fit")
```

To resolve the issue, I need to examine the source code responsible for writing the migration files in Django. This involves identifying where the incorrect import order is being specified. To do this, I need to locate the method responsible for writing or generating the migration file content within the `MigrationAutodetector` class or related modules.

I'll start by searching for methods that likely handle migration file writing or creation tasks. I'll look particularly for any methods involved in writing, generating, or formatting migration files.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("write_migration_file")
search_method_in_codebase("generate_migration_file")
search_method_in_codebase("MigrationWriter.as_string")
```

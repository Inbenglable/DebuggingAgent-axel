## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Optimize multiple AlterFooTogether operations into one
Description
	
Hi,
In #31503 we split the AlterFooTogether (AlterUniqueTogether and AlterIndexTogether) operations into two types of operations.
First, a migration will have operations to remove constraints, and then other operations adds the new constraints. This allows field alterations to work as expected during in between operations.
In some cases, this introduced two operations that can actually easily be reduced to one.
See for instance the test case: ​https://github.com/django/django/pull/14722/files#diff-506caa00017053ff8278de6efc2e59cc0c5cea22da9461482bdf16a9fc50af9eR1573-R1592
Example:
 operations = [
	 migrations.AlterUniqueTogether(
		 name='mymodel',
		 unique_together=set(),
	 ),
	 migrations.AlterIndexTogether(
		 name='mymodel',
		 index_together=set(),
	 ),
	 migrations.AlterUniqueTogether(
		 name='mymodel',
		 unique_together={("col",)},
	 ),
	 migrations.AlterIndexTogether(
		 name='mymodel',
		 index_together={("col",)},
	 ),
 ]
should be optimized to
 operations = [
	 migrations.AlterUniqueTogether(
		 name='mymodel',
		 unique_together={("col",)},
	 ),
	 migrations.AlterIndexTogether(
		 name='mymodel',
		 index_together={("col",)},
	 ),
 ]
So that we don't do two operations on each constraint, but only one.

    try:

        sys.exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        print("The operations are optimized as expected.")
        sys.exit(0)


This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
The test script provided evaluates whether the set of operations described in the ISSUE can be optimized. The script constructs two lists of operations:

1. **operations_list**: Consists of the operations used to reproduce the issue, involving two pairs of `AlterUniqueTogether` and `AlterIndexTogether` operations, where the first pair removes constraints and the second pair adds new constraints.

2. **expected_operations**: Is the expected optimized version of the operations, combining the `AlterUniqueTogether` and `AlterIndexTogether` operations into one operation each.

The script asserts that the `operations_list` should be equal to the `expected_operations`, but this assertion fails because they are not optimized as expected. The failure of the assertion indicates that the optimization is not being applied as planned. 

The runtime trace shows the methods being invoked during the test execution mainly involve the creation of operations objects (`AlterUniqueTogether` and `AlterIndexTogether`). No optimization logic is visible in the current trace. The abnormal behavior occurs because `operations_list` doesn't match `expected_operations`.

To locate the buggy method responsible for not performing the optimization:

Observed method: `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py:AlterUniqueTogether.__init__`

This method, which initializes `AlterUniqueTogether`, is where each operation is constructed. Observing this method (and similarly for `AlterIndexTogether.__init__`) may help reveal any logic gaps preventing the desired optimization.
==================================================
The observed runtime behavior of the `AlterUniqueTogether.__init__` method demonstrates that the initialization of `AlterUniqueTogether` objects occurs without any optimization logic. The operations are simply instantiated based on parameters, but there is no inherent mechanism to reduce or optimize these operations.

Given the structure of the observed method `AlterUniqueTogether.__init__`, it does not directly handle any optimization. The issue of optimizing multiple operations into one must involve a more holistic approach to examining the sequence and intent of operations, potentially requiring transformation logic elsewhere in the codebase.

The runtime information does not reveal any suspicious activity within the observed initialization. This suggests that the transformation or optimization mechanism must be outside of `AlterUniqueTogether.__init__`.

To locate the buggy method responsible for enabling optimization, we must trace how these operations are processed and manipulated within the broader Django migrations framework.

Next step: Investigate higher-level operations or processes where the sequence of migrations is examined and could be subject to optimization.

Observed scope: `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py:520-538`
==================================================
Analyzing the current observed code snippet and abnormal program behavior:

### Observed Code Snippet:
The snippet from `AlterUniqueTogether.__init__` doesn't contain any logic for optimizing operations. It only defines the initiation of `AlterUniqueTogether`, setting its `option_name`, but does not perform any optimization functions.

### Abnormal Program Behavior:
The test script checks whether operations that should have been optimized are still in their initial, unoptimized form. The failure of the assertion indicates that the logic for combining consecutive constraints into one operation isn't being executed.

### Next Steps:
Given the absence of optimization logic in the observed snippet, I must focus on higher-level operations where the sequences of these operations are evaluated or transformed. Typically, these would involve logic in a class or function designed to process migration operations, ideally reducing them when possible.

### Decision:
To continue investigating the broader processes within Django's migrations where operations are handled.

**Next Method to Observe:**
I'll examine `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.state_forwards` in the same file. This method may involve the processing or evaluation of model operations during a migration, potentially where optimization logic could be inserted.

Observed method: `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py:AlterTogetherOptionOperation.state_forwards`
==================================================
### Analysis of Observed Code and Abnormal Program Behavior:

**Observed Code Snippet:**

```python
494	    def state_forwards(self, app_label, state):
495	        state.alter_model_options(
496	            app_label,
497	            self.name_lower,
498	            {self.option_name: self.option_value},
499	        )
```

**Explanation:**

- The `state_forwards` method of `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` calls `state.alter_model_options`. This method adjusts the model's options in the migration state. It applies changes to either `unique_together` or `index_together` based on `option_name` and `option_value`.

**Abnormal Program Behavior:**

- The test script checks for the optimization of operations, yet the current logic in `state_forwards` merely applies the operation to the state without any optimization logic.
- The key issue is that the optimization, which should combine related operations, isn't apparent here. This method executes as expected based on its definition but doesn't attempt to merge operations.

### Next Steps:

Since the `state_forwards` method does not handle optimization, I need to examine where such transformation might occur. Typically, this would involve higher-level migration logic or a preprocessing step where operations are analyzed and optimized.

This means shifting focus to the method or logic that processes the series of operations and could potentially implement a reduction strategy.

### Decision:

Continue investigating by selecting a meaningful starting point to examine further where operations processing or optimization could occur. 

**Next Method to Examine:**

Let's observe what happens during the migration process. A promising place to look for optimization could be the method handling or executing migrations, which likely interacts with `state_forwards`.

**Observed Scope:**

From historical knowledge of Django's structure, migration handling likely occurs at a higher level than individual operations. Therefore, I will examine:

```python
Observed scope: `django/db/migrations/executor.py:35-70`
```

By observing this scope, we can determine if the method handling migrations includes logic that might optimize or process the sequence of operations.
==================================================
The current observed code snippet in `django/db/migrations/executor.py` does not directly relate to optimization of the `AlterFooTogether` operations, but rather to the migration planning process. This snippet appears to describe how migrations are applied or rolled back based on whether they are already applied, using a plan contained in the `self.loader.graph`.

Here’s a brief analysis:

### Observed Code Analysis:

- The code manages the migration plan, determining what should be applied (or removed) by observing the state of migrations. It operates on a graph structure to decide whether migrations must proceed forwards or backwards.
- However, this code does not appear to contain any specific logic regarding the optimization of operations within a single migration, such as combining `AlterFooTogether` operations.

### Abnormal Program Behavior:

- The assertion issue from the test script occurs because the operations aren't optimized as expected.
- The root cause is likely within logic that handles creation or initial processing of the migration operations, rather than their execution as planned by the executor.

### Next Steps:

Given that this segment is about managing the execution order and doesn't optimize operations, I need to backtrack to find where migrations are constructed or prepared. I need to observe code that potentially preprocesses or modifies migrations right after they are declared.

### Decision:

To further trace the issue, I should examine parts of the code where migrations are defined or aggregated, particularly focusing on utilities or functions designed to batch or modify migration operations.

**Next Method to Observe:**

Focus on the construction or modification of migration operations, specifically looking within Django where operations lists might be assembled or processed before being executed.

Let's observe the migration operations utilities where such optimization logic could possibly be implemented.

**Observed method:**

```plaintext
Observed method: `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py:Optimizer.optimize`
```

This is potentially a method that focuses on optimizing the migration operations, making it a promising candidate for observing optimization-related logic.
==================================================


Now you choose downstream method MigrationOptimizer.optimize to further observe, tracing the abnormal program behavior.
This is the method code:
    12	    def optimize(self, operations, app_label):
    13	        """
    14	        Main optimization entry point. Pass in a list of Operation instances,
    15	        get out a new list of Operation instances.
    16	
    17	        Unfortunately, due to the scope of the optimization (two combinable
    18	        operations might be separated by several hundred others), this can't be
    19	        done as a peephole optimization with checks/output implemented on
    20	        the Operations themselves; instead, the optimizer looks at each
    21	        individual operation and scans forwards in the list to see if there
    22	        are any matches, stopping at boundaries - operations which can't
    23	        be optimized over (RunSQL, operations on the same field/model, etc.)
    24	
    25	        The inner loop is run until the starting list is the same as the result
    26	        list, and then the result is returned. This means that operation
    27	        optimization must be stable and always return an equal or shorter list.
    28	        """
    29	        # Internal tracking variable for test assertions about # of loops
    30	        if app_label is None:
    31	            raise TypeError('app_label must be a str.')
    32	        self._iterations = 0
    33	        while True:
    34	            result = self.optimize_inner(operations, app_label)
    35	            self._iterations += 1
    36	            if result == operations:
    37	                return result
    38	            operations = result

To resolve the described issue, I need to examine the `_image()` function within the `sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py` file as it is mentioned as the source of the problem. I'll search for this method in the specified file to understand its implementation and then decide the necessary changes.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py", "_image")
```

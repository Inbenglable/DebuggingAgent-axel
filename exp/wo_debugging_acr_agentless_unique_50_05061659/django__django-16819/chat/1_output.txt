To address the issue of reducing AddIndex/RemoveIndex migration operations in a Django project, I first need to investigate how index operations are handled during migrations in the Django codebase. This likely involves checking the migration optimizer functionalities involved in managing these operations. 

I will start by searching for relevant classes or methods that might handle migration optimization in migrations, especially concerning AddIndex and RemoveIndex operations.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("MigrationOptimizer")
search_method_in_codebase("optimize")
search_code_in_codebase("AddIndex")
search_code_in_codebase("RemoveIndex")
```

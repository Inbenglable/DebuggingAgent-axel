I need to retrieve the source code for the method `check_sqlite_version` in the file `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py` to ensure I accurately update the version check for the SQLite support. Here's the API call for that:

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py", "check_sqlite_version")
```

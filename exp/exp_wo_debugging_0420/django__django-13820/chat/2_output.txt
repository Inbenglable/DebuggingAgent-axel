The code for the `MigrationLoader.load_disk` method is already available to me. The goal is to refine the check for modules that lack a `__file__` attribute to ensure it accurately distinguishes between namespace packages and modules in environments that do not set `__file__`. This requires altering the `getattr(module, '__file__', None)` check by combining it with an `isinstance(m.__path__, list)` check to better comply with the Python import API.

Given this insight into the problem and with the method code available, I am ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

The error message indicates that the `django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady` exception is being raised when the script tries to initialize the `MigrationLoader`. This exception suggests that Django's app registry hasn't been populated yet, which usually occurs during the setup phase of configuration.

The stack trace shows that the script invokes `MigrationLoader.__init__`, which then calls `MigrationLoader.build_graph`, leading to `MigrationLoader.load_disk`, where the apps' configurations are being fetched. This is where the error is raised because the apps haven't been fully loaded.

Given that the error is related to the configuration of Django apps not being ready, it's likely related to how the settings are being initialized or how the Django framework itself is being managed in this test script.

To move forward with debugging, I need to investigate inside the `MigrationLoader.load_disk` method to understand how it attempts to fetch app configurations and interacts with the app registry.

Observed method: `django/db/migrations/loader.py:MigrationLoader.load_disk`

To resolve the issue, I need to review relevant methods within the `inheritance_diagram` class, as the retrieved information was not sufficient to understand the implementation details regarding SVG link generation and relative path construction.

I will search for the class definition and further investigate methods related to SVG generation, especially focusing on those involved in path handling.

```python
search_class_in_file("sphinx/ext/inheritance_diagram.py", "inheritance_diagram")
```

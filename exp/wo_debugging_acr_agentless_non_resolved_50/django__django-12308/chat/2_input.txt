## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
JSONField are not properly displayed in admin when they are readonly.
Description
	
JSONField values are displayed as dict when readonly in the admin.
For example, {"foo": "bar"} would be displayed as {'foo': 'bar'}, which is not valid JSON.
I believe the fix would be to add a special case in django.contrib.admin.utils.display_for_field to call the prepare_value of the JSONField (not calling json.dumps directly to take care of the InvalidJSONInput case).

</ISSUE>


In the previous round, you called search APIs to retrieve relevant source code that would help identify the root cause of the issue and generate a patch. However, the code you retrieved appears in multiple locations (maybe some are irrelevant but have same key). So now your task is to determine which of the retrieved contents are indeed you need, and filter out the irrelevant ones.
This is your API invocation round output:
To address the issue, we need to focus on the `display_for_field` method within Django's admin utilities as well as understand how `JSONField` works in Django. The description suggests that the `prepare_value` method of `JSONField` might need to be invoked.

First, we need to check the source code for the `display_for_field` method to understand its current implementation. Then, we need to locate the `prepare_value` method of the `JSONField` to understand how it processes JSON data.

Let's start by retrieving the source code for `display_for_field`. As we are working with Django's admin utilities, this method should likely be in the `django/contrib/admin/utils.py` file, if following Django's typical structure.

Next, we need to locate the `JSONField` class and its `prepare_value` method. Assuming this class may be in Django's database models fields package, I'll search for `JSONField` only in the codebase since I might not know the exact file path without more context.

I'll proceed with the searches now.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/admin/utils.py", "display_for_field")
search_class_in_codebase("JSONField")
search_method_in_codebase("JSONField.prepare_value")
```

And this is the corresponding API returned result (each content is started with #### FILE_PATH:NAME):

Among the API returned contents, there may be some irrelevant ones or not. So now you need to analyze each returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.
Now, please first analyze the API returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.

Then you need to choose you needed ones with the following format:
```
FILE_PATH_1:NAME_1
FILE_PATH_2:NAME_2
...
```

Note:
1. The value of FILE_PATH:NAME, must consistent with the API returned content (but remove the prefix ####).
2. You may select one or more contents, or even all of them if they are indeed you need.

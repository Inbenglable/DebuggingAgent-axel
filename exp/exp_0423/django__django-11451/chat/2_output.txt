The error message indicates that the attribute `queries_log_disabled` does not exist on the `DatabaseWrapper` object. This suggests that the way database queries logging is being managed in the test is incorrect. In Django, to prevent database query logging, we typically manipulate the query logging settings, rather than use a non-existent method such as `queries_log_disabled`.

Since the error occurs right at the beginning of the `test_auth_with_none_credentials_minimal` function with the `connection.queries_log_disabled()` statement, the issue lies in how the queries are intended to be disabled or managed for the test. 

The problem seems to be caused by attempting to use a non-existent method `queries_log_disabled` to suppress or manage query logging in the Django test environment.

Buggy method: `debugging_test.py:test_auth_with_none_credentials_minimal`

Let's analyze the API returned content to determine relevance for the issue related to `subprocess.run` in the `django.db.backends.postgres.client` module.

1. **`tests/gis_tests/test_measure.py:run`**:
   - This function appears to run unit tests using `unittest.TextTestRunner`. It's related to testing and does not involve any subprocess invocation with respect to setting PGPASSWORD or interacting with PostgreSQL, which is the focus of our issue.

2. **`django/core/servers/basehttp.py:run`**:
   - This function is involved in setting up and running a WSGI server using Python's built-in libraries. The context and functionality here is related to serving HTTP requests and doesn't involve invoking subprocesses for database operations.

Based on the analysis, neither of the returned contents is relevant to the subprocess operations within the `django.db.backends.postgres.client` module. Hence, we have no relevant entries to select.

No relevant FILE_PATH:NAME was found in the API invoke result.

The issue described pertains to the incorrect inclusion of fields specified in `Meta.ordering` in the `GROUP BY` clause. The patch provided aims to address this problem by adjusting logic in the `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` file to exclude fields from `Meta.ordering` in the `GROUP BY` clause.

**Review of the test output:**

1. **Original Output:**
   - The test fails with a `RuntimeError` related to the `setup_test_environment`.
   - The error occurs because `setup_test_environment()` seems to be called multiple times without a call to `teardown_test_environment()`.

2. **Patched Output:**
   - The behavior and error output remain the same after the patch is applied, indicating that the underlying issue with `Meta.ordering` fields in `GROUP BY` was not encountered because of the `RuntimeError`.

**Conclusion:**

The patch aims to address the logic determining what fields are included in the `GROUP BY` clause. However, the test does not appear to run successfully due to a `RuntimeError` before even checking for that logic. This suggests that the test environment setup needs to be fixed before the relevant issue (handling `Meta.ordering` in `GROUP BY`) can be tested effectively.

Overall, because the test does not even reach a state where the primary issue can be verified, it's not possible to assert that the issue is resolved from the patched output.

Issue resolved: `False`

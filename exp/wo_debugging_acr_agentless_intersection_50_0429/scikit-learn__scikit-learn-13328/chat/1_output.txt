To address the issue of `TypeError` when fitting `HuberRegressor` with boolean predictors, we need to examine how the `HuberRegressor.fit` method processes the input data `X`. Specifically, we want to determine where and how the data conversion is handled, and if a type-checking and conversion step for boolean arrays is necessary.

To proceed with fixing this issue, I need to retrieve the source code of the `HuberRegressor` class and its `fit` method. Once I see how the inputs are being processed, I can then patch the code to ensure boolean arrays are converted to floats.

Let's start by searching for the `HuberRegressor` class and its `fit` method:

```python
search_class_in_codebase("HuberRegressor")
search_method_in_codebase("HuberRegressor.fit")
```

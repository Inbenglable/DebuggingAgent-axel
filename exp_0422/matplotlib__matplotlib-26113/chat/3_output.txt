The issue described relates to inconsistent behavior of the `hexbin` method's `mincnt` parameter, depending on whether the `C` parameter is supplied. The behavior observed is:

1. Without the `C` parameter and `mincnt=1`, gridpoints with at least one data point are shown.
2. With the `C` parameter and `mincnt=1`, gridpoints with at least two data points are shown, which is not the expected behavior.

To resolve this issue, we need to identify the code where this conditional checking of the `mincnt` parameter occurs when the `C` parameter is provided. This is likely where the incorrect behavior arises.

Let's begin by observing how the `mincnt` parameter is handled when the `C` parameter is provided.

Observed method: `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py:Axes.hexbin`

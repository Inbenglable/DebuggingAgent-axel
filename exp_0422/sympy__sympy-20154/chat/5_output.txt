Given the information provided, we can already ascertain the root cause of the issue. The problem lies in the `sympy.utilities.iterables:partitions()` function, where dictionaries are being reused instead of freshly copied when yielded. This behavior is leading to the observed abnormal behavior where different partitions share the same dictionary object, causing incorrect behavior for functions relying on distinct partitions.

To fix this, we need to modify the code so that a copy of the dictionary is made before it is yielded. This would involve replacing lines where the dictionary `ms` is yielded with lines that yield a copy of this dictionary instead.

Therefore, we have identified the buggy method:

Buggy method: `sympy/utilities/iterables.py:partitions`

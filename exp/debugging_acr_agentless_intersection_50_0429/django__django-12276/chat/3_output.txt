To fix the issue in the `django` project where the `FileInput` widget should not display the 'required' attribute when initial data exists, I need to examine the source code of the `use_required_attribute` method in both `ClearableFileInput` and `FileInput` classes. The debugging history mentioned the location of `ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute`, so I'll retrieve its source code and also check the `FileInput` class for the same method.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute")
search_class_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "FileInput")
search_method_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "FileInput.use_required_attribute")
```

To resolve the issue of the `TypeError` when passing boolean arrays to the `HuberRegressor.fit` method, we likely need to modify the `fit` method to automatically convert boolean arrays to float arrays, similar to how other linear models handle this.

Let's retrieve the relevant code for the `fit` method in the `HuberRegressor` class to ensure we have all the details before generating the patch.

The `fit` method source code is already retrieved, so there's no need for additional source code retrieval. We can proceed to generate the patch.

```python
# Verify source code retrieval is complete for generating patch
Ready generation: True
```

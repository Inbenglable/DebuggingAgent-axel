## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
sylow_subgroup() IndexError 
I use sympy 1.6.1, with numpy 1.18.5, scipy 1.4.1, under Python '3.8.5 (default, Aug  5 2020, 09:44:06) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)]'. 

The code that I run as the following gives IndexError for sylow_subgroup():

from sympy.combinatorics import DihedralGroup, PermutationGroup, Permutation

G = DihedralGroup(18)

S2 = G.sylow_subgroup(p=2)
 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<input>", line 7, in <module>
  File "D:\anaconda38\envs\default\lib\site-packages\sympy\combinatorics\perm_groups.py", line 4370, in sylow_subgroup
    blocks = self.minimal_blocks()
  File "D:\anaconda38\envs\default\lib\site-packages\sympy\combinatorics\perm_groups.py", line 2207, in minimal_blocks
    del num_blocks[i], blocks[i]
IndexError: list assignment index out of range

The same error shows up as well when I set: 
G = DihedralGroup(2*25)

S2 = G.sylow_subgroup(p=2)

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue, we need to locate the source of the problem which appears to be in the method `sylow_subgroup` of the `PermutationGroup` class. The error is arising from the `minimal_blocks` method. To address this, we'll first need to retrieve the source code for `PermutationGroup.sylow_subgroup` and `PermutationGroup.minimal_blocks` to understand why the `IndexError` is occurring. 

Let's begin by obtaining the source code for these methods.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/perm_groups.py", "PermutationGroup.sylow_subgroup")
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/perm_groups.py", "PermutationGroup.minimal_blocks")
```

```python
    def sylow_subgroup(self, p):
        '''
        Return a p-Sylow subgroup of the group.

        The algorithm is described in [1], Chapter 4, Section 7

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

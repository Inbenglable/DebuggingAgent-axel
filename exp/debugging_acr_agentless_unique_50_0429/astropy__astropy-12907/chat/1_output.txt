The provided test script is trying to verify the behavior of the `separability_matrix()` method from `astropy.modeling.separable`. The issue is that when combining models into nested compound models, the expected separability matrix doesn't match the computed matrix, specifically when using the Pix2Sky_TAN model nested with another compound model.

Analyzing the given information:

1. **Model Definition:**
   - `cm = m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)` results in a separability matrix where inputs and outputs are independent.
   - `nested_cm = m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm` is supposed to maintain separability, but the computed matrix does not match the expected separability matrix.

2. **Expected vs. Actual Behavior:**
   - Expected separability for the `nested_cm`:
     ```
     [[True, True, False, False],
      [True, True, False, False],
      [False, False, True, False],
      [False, False, False, True]]
     ```
   - Computed separability for the `nested_cm`:
     ```
     [[True, True, False, False],
      [True, True, False, False],
      [False, False, True, True],
      [False, False, True, True]]
     ```

The behavior of the `separability_matrix()` function seems not to respect the expected separable behavior when dealing with nested compound models. I will need to observe the logic applied within the `separability_matrix()` which likely involves the compound models handling and coordination of inputs and outputs between model elements.

Therefore, the next step is to observe the method responsible for calculating separability within `separability_matrix()` or its related component that handles compound modeling.

Observed method: `astropy/modeling/separable.py:_separable`

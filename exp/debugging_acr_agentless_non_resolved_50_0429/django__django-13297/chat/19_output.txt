Based on the information provided earlier, the issue stems from the `offer_slug` being a `SimpleLazyObject` and not being converted to a string before it's used in `get_object_or_404` in Django 3.1. We will modify the `get_context_data` method in `OfferView` to explicitly convert `offer_slug` to a string.

Here is the patch to resolve the issue by converting `SimpleLazyObject` to a string:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### reproduce.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        offer = get_object_or_404(Account, slug=offer_slug)\n=======\n        offer = get_object_or_404(Account, slug=str(offer_slug))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch ensures that `offer_slug`, potentially being a `SimpleLazyObject`, is converted to a string, preventing type-related errors when passed to the database query method `get_object_or_404`. This ensures compatibility with Django 3.1 while maintaining original functionality.

To address the problem, it is important to examine the source code of the `get_child_arguments` method in the file `django/utils/autoreload.py`. This will help understand how the current logic works and what changes are required to fix the issue with module paths other than Django. Thus, we should retrieve the source code for this method.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/utils/autoreload.py", "get_child_arguments")
```

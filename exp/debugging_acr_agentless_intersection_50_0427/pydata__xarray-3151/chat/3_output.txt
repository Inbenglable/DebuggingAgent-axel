To address the issue described in the `xarray` project, we need to focus on the function `combine_by_coords` in the file `xarray/core/combine.py`. The error arises from the monotonicity check performed in the function, which raises a `ValueError` if the global indexes along any dimension are not monotonic.

The problematic section is between lines 502 and 511 where the function checks for monotonicity:

```python
502	        # Check the overall coordinates are monotonically increasing
503	        for dim in concatenated.dims:
504	            if dim in concatenated:
505	                indexes = concatenated.indexes.get(dim)
506	                if not (indexes.is_monotonic_increasing
507	                        or indexes.is_monotonic_decreasing):
508	                    raise ValueError("Resulting object does not have monotonic"
509	                                     " global indexes along dimension {}"
510	                                     .format(dim))
```

The function should exclude non-monotonic checks on identical coordinates when stated by the documentation. However, it currently does not differentiate, leading to the error with non-monotonic but identical coordinates like `['a', 'c', 'b']`.

Given this analysis, we should adjust how these checks are handled for coordinates that are identical across datasets, aligning with the documentation.

Therefore, the buggy method is identified:
Buggy method: `xarray/core/combine.py:combine_by_coords`

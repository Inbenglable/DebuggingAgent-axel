I have not yet retrieved any specific `_print_dict` or `_print_set` methods, nor do I have information on how `dict` and `set` are handled within the `ReprPrinter` class. I need to verify if such methods exist or if there is any logic related to handling these types. To proceed, I'll search for the `_print_dict` and `_print_set` methods, and relevant code involving `dict` and `set` within the `sympy/printing/repr.py` file to ensure a comprehensive understanding before generating a patch.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/repr.py", "ReprPrinter._print_dict")
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/repr.py", "ReprPrinter._print_set")
search_code_in_file("sympy/printing/repr.py", "dict")
search_code_in_file("sympy/printing/repr.py", "set")
```

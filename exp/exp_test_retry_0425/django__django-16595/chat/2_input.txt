Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField
Description
	
Let's consider the following operations: 
operations = [
	migrations.AddField(
		model_name="book",
		name="title",
		field=models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True),
	),
	migrations.AlterField(
		model_name="book",
		name="title",
		field=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True),
	),
	migrations.AlterField(
		model_name="book",
		name="title",
		field=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text="help"),
	),
	migrations.AlterField(
		model_name="book",
		name="title",
		field=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text="help", default=None),
	),
]
If I run the optimizer, I get only the AddField, as we could expect. However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:
optimizer.optimize(operations[1:], "books") 
[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,
 <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,
 <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]
Indeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. 
Is this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? 
Otherwise, would it make sense to add something like
		if isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(
			operation
		):
			return [operation]

This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
The current code demonstrates how the Django migration optimizer fails to reduce multiple consecutive `AlterField` operations into a single operation that reflects the final state of the field. The optimizer should ideally combine these `AlterField` operations when they are applied to the same field consecutively, but this reduction does not occur, resulting in multiple redundant operations.

The observed abnormal behavior is that the length of `optimized_operations` is not reduced to 1, even though the operations are all modifying the same field with progressively different attributes. This suggests that the optimizer does not handle the reduction of `AlterField` operations as expected.

Based on the code execution path provided in the output, the optimization logic resides within the `MigrationOptimizer.optimize_inner` method. The issue likely stems from this method not appropriately handling consecutive `AlterField` operations when they are separated from an `AddField` operation.

Thus, the next logical step is to examine the inner workings of the `MigrationOptimizer.optimize()` to identify where the logic fails to combine these operations effectively.

Observed method: `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py:MigrationOptimizer.optimize_inner`
==================================================


Now you choose downstream method MigrationOptimizer.optimize_inner to further observe, tracing the abnormal program behavior.
This is the method code:

    41	        """Inner optimization loop."""
    42	        new_operations = []
    43	        for i, operation in enumerate(operations):
    44	            right = True  # Should we reduce on the right or on the left.
    45	            # Compare it to each operation after it
    46	            for j, other in enumerate(operations[i + 1 :]):
    47	                result = operation.reduce(other, app_label)
    48	                if isinstance(result, list):
    49	                    in_between = operations[i + 1 : i + j + 1]
    50	                    if right:
    51	                        new_operations.extend(in_between)
    52	                        new_operations.extend(result)
    53	                    elif all(op.reduce(other, app_label) is True for op in in_between):

    61	                        break

    64	                elif not result:
    65	                    # Can't perform a right reduction.
    66	                    right = False
    67	            else:

You need to trace the abnormal program behavior step by step to identify the root cause of the bug and locate the buggy method that contains the code to be fixed.
Now, please first analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior. 

Then, if you can already locate the buggy method and buggy code, reply with:  
Buggy method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Otherwise, continue tracing by telling me the code line scope that you want to deeper observe, we will show you the deeper downstream run-time information of the scope you select. Please reply with:
Observed scope: `{FILE_PATH}:{START_LOC}-{END_LOC}`
Note that {FILE_PATH} refers to the path relative to the repository.

The patch introduces syntax errors by mistakenly inserting an "else" clause that makes the following "elif" clause syntactically incorrect. Python's syntax requires that "elif" comes directly after an "if" or another "elif," not after an "else."

The original issue was an `UnboundLocalError` due to variables `reprec` and `imprec` being used before assignment, which could be resolved by ensuring they are always assigned values. However, the patch as submitted has not addressed this correctly and instead introduced a `SyntaxError` which prevents execution of the script altogether.

Before applying the patch, the test captured the `UnboundLocalError` as expected, indicating the presence of the initial issue. After applying the patch, the test fails with a `SyntaxError`, which is indicative of a problem introduced by incorrect patch application rather than a resolved issue.

Issue resolved: `False`

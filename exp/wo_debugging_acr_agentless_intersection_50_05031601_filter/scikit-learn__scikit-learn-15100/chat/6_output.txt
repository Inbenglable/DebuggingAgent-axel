The patch provided by the repair agent shows an attempt to fix the issue by modifying the `strip_accents_unicode` function in the `text.py` file of the `scikit-learn` library. The proposed change suggests removing the conditional check `if normalized == s:` from the function.

However, examining the test outputs before and after applying the patch reveals that after applying the patch, a `SyntaxError` occurs. This indicates that the modification introduced an error in the code, leading to invalid syntax.

Here's a breakdown of the outputs:

### Original Output

- The test fails with an `AssertionError`, indicating that the accented character in `s2` is not removed as expected.

### Patched Output

- The test encounters a `SyntaxError`, showing that there is an issue with the patch itself. The code does not run properly to test if the original issue with accent stripping is fixed.

Considering that the patched output results in a `SyntaxError`, it suggests that not only did the patch fail to fix the original issue, but it also introduced a new syntax error, making the code unable to execute. Therefore, the issue is not resolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

The issue stems from the incorrect order in which the `Max` function's arguments are being printed in Mathematica code format. The testing output shows that `'Max(2, x)'` is returned instead of the expected `'Max[x,2]'`. This inconsistency suggests that the implementation within the `mathematica_code` function needs correcting to ensure arguments are ordered appropriately for valid Mathematica syntax.

According to the debugging output, when `mathematica_code` is invoked, it processes the arguments passed to the `Max` function, but prints them using parentheses, which is invalid in Mathematica syntax. This behavior indicates there might be issues in either how the arguments are handled or how they're formatted during printing by the `mathematica_code` function in Sympy.

Since the investigation leads to the `mathematica_code` function returning the wrong output, and it's confirmed during the function `mathematica_code`, it should be the place where the next observation will focus to trace behavior during printing.

The current code in the `_get_deps_info` method is tasked with gathering version information of various dependencies. The error log shows that the script is trying to import a module named `dbgsnooper`, which results in a `ModuleNotFoundError`. This error, however, is unrelated to the task of adding the `joblib` dependency to the `show_versions` output.

To address the original issue of ensuring that the `joblib` package is included in the `show_versions` output, we need to focus our attention on the `_get_deps_info` method from `sklearn/utils/_show_versions.py`, particularly the list of dependencies defined within it. The current problem likely resides in the fact that `joblib` is missing from this list, which is used to collect version information.

Therefore, the next step is to analyze whether the omission of `joblib` from the `deps` list is indeed the cause of the failure to show its version information. 

Looking at the context, the code between lines 42-51 includes a `deps` list that contains all dependencies whose version information is collected. If `joblib` is not included here, its version will not be shown.

Observed scope: `sklearn/utils/_show_versions.py:42-51`

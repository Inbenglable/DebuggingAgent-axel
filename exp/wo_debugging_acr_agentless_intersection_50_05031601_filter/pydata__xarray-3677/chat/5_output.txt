To determine whether the issue is resolved, let's examine the provided patch and the test outputs:

### Patch Review
The proposed patch attempts to address the issue by:
1. Modifying the `merge` method in `xarray/core/dataset.py` to handle `DataArray` objects by converting them to `Dataset` objects using `other.to_dataset()` if `other` is an instance of `DataArray`.
2. Updating the type annotation to include `DataArray` as a possible type for `other`.

### Analysis of Test Outputs

**Original Output:**
The original output shows that the `ds.merge(da)` method fails because it tries to call `.items()` on a `DataArray` object, leading to an `AttributeError`.

**Patched Output:**
The patched output indicates a `NameError` because `DataArray` is not defined in the scope of where it is checked with `isinstance(other, DataArray)`. This suggests there might be a missing import for `DataArray` or a misunderstanding of the scope for recognizing `DataArray`.

Given the patched output, the test still fails, but for a different reason than before. The problem persists in a new form.

### Conclusion
The patch attempts to fix the bug but introduces a new error (a `NameError`), indicating that the necessary imports or scope context for `DataArray` wasn't properly considered. Therefore, the original issue is not resolved.

**Issue resolved: `False`**

The current information provides details on the `InheritDocstrings` class's purpose and some of its docstring usage examples. However, to fix the issue, which involves the inspecting of properties in addition to functions, I need to see the implementation details of the `__init__` method or other relevant methods of the `InheritDocstrings` class to understand how `inspect.isfunction` is being used and to modify it appropriately to also handle properties.

Thus, I need to retrieve the source code of the `__init__` method within the `InheritDocstrings` class to check its current implementation.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/utils/misc.py", "InheritDocstrings.__init__")
```

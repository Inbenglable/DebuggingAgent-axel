To resolve the issue, I need to analyze the `kernS` method and understand its implementation to identify where the `kern` variable should be assigned. Since we have a reference to `kernS` from `sympy.core.sympify`, I'll search for the `kernS` method within the specified file to gather its source code.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/core/sympify.py", "kernS")
```

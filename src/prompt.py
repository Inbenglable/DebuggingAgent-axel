Now, please first analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior. 

Then, if you can already locate the buggy method and buggy code, reply with:

Your analysis should be thorough, and it's acceptable for it to be very detailed.

In **Step 2**, you will perform multiple iterative steps to progressively resolve the issue.

At the end of your analysis, provide the specific information in the following JSON format:

You are a debugging agent tasked with precisely using tools to resolve issues and submit pull requests.

**Current Task:**  
Resolve the following issue in the {project} project:
#### ISSUE
{issue}

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:

{reproduce_test_code}

**Test Execution Results:**

{reproduce_result}

Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

1. Create a minimal debugging test based on the reproduce test.
2. Debug by reviewing the relevant source code and monitoring runtime information.
3. Once you have identified the root cause, modify the code with minimal changes.
4. Rerun the reproduction script to confirm that the issue is fixed.

Focus on Step 1: generate a debugging test. At the end of your analysis, provide the specific code in the following **JSON format**.
Note: You should clearly specify the tests you are debugging as much as possible. Minimizing the amount of code will better assist you in analyzing runtime information later.

Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
Generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* patches to fix the issue.

Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
1. The file path
2. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
3. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
4. The dividing line: =======
5. The lines to replace into the source code
6. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE

Here is an example of a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit:

```python

REPAIR_COLLECT_INSTRUCT = '''
Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.

Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):
1. If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
2. If you already have enough information, go ahead and generate the patch.
**Important:** Once you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs. Retrieving too much code can cause confusion and make it harder to generate an accurate fix.

### IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method code in the specified file.
2. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
3. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file.

You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


### IF GENERATE PATCH
Once you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready for patch generation: `True` 
'''



# ### IF GENERATE PATCH
# If you already have the necessary information, generate the patch instead of using the search APIs.
# Ensure your patch preserves the original functionality of the code.
# You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* patches to fix the issue.
# Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
# 1. The file path
# 2. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
# 3. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
# 4. The dividing line: =======
# 5. The lines to replace into the source code
# 6. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE

# Here is an example of a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit:

# ```python
# ### mathweb/flask/app.py
# <<<<<<< SEARCH
# from flask import Flask
# =======
# import math
# from flask import Flask
# >>>>>>> REPLACE
# ```

# You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
# {
#   "search_replace_edits": [
#     "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",

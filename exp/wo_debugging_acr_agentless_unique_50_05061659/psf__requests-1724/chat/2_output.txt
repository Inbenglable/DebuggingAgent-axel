To address the issue, we need to ensure the method name is always converted to a standard string type, which is essential for compatibility with Python 2.7. The reference to `sessions.py:313` indicates the location where the method name is processed, specifically using `.upper()`. To fix this, we should consider converting the method name from Unicode to a string type if it isn't already.

To implement the patch, I need to access the code around `sessions.py:313` to understand its context and ensure the required changes won't affect other functionalities unexpectedly. Therefore, I'll retrieve the surrounding code of `req.method = method.upper()` in `sessions.py`.

```python
search_code_in_file("requests/sessions.py", "req.method = method.upper()")
```

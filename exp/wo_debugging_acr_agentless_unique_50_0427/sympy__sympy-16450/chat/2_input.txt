Posify ignores is_finite assmptions
Posify removes a finite assumption from a symbol:
```julia
In [1]: x = Symbol('x', finite=True)                                                                                                           

In [2]: x._assumptions                                                                                                                         
Out[2]: {'finite': True, 'infinite': False, 'commutative': True}

In [3]: x.is_finite                                                                                                                            
Out[3]: True

In [4]: xp, _ = posify(x)                                                                                                                      

In [5]: xp._assumptions                                                                                                                        
Out[5]: 
{'positive': True,
 'real': True,
 'hermitian': True,
 'imaginary': False,
 'negative': False,
 'nonnegative': True,
 'nonzero': True,
 'zero': False,
 'complex': True,
 'nonpositive': False,
 'commutative': True}

In [6]: xp.is_finite                                                                                                                           

In [7]: print(xp.is_finite)                                                                                                                    
None
```
I think that posify should preserve the finiteness assumption. Possibly other assumptions should be preserved as well (integer, rational, prime, even, odd...).

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue related to the `posify` function, I need to locate and analyze its source code to modify it to preserve finiteness and potentially other assumptions. Since the issue description does not specify the file path for `posify`, I will need to search for the method in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("posify")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("posify")
RESULT:
#### sympy/simplify/simplify.py:posify
```python
def posify(eq):
    """Return eq (with generic symbols made positive) and a
    dictionary containing the mapping between the old and new
    symbols.

    Any symbol that has positive=None will be replaced with a positive dummy
    symbol having the same name. This replacement will allow more symbolic
    processing of expressions, especially those involving powers and
    logarithms.

    A dictionary that can be sent to subs to restore eq to its original
    symbols is also returned.

    >>> from sympy import posify, Symbol, log, solve
    >>> from sympy.abc import x
    >>> posify(x + Symbol('p', positive=True) + Symbol('n', negative=True))
    (_x + n + p, {_x: x})

    >>> eq = 1/x
    >>> log(eq).expand()
    log(1/x)
    >>> log(posify(eq)[0]).expand()
    -log(_x)
    >>> p, rep = posify(eq)
    >>> log(p).expand().subs(rep)
    -log(x)

    It is possible to apply the same transformations to an iterable
    of expressions:

    >>> eq = x**2 - 4
    >>> solve(eq, x)
    [-2, 2]
    >>> eq_x, reps = posify([eq, x]); eq_x
    [_x**2 - 4, _x]
    >>> solve(*eq_x)
    [2]
    """
    eq = sympify(eq)
    if iterable(eq):
        f = type(eq)
        eq = list(eq)
        syms = set()
        for e in eq:
            syms = syms.union(e.atoms(Symbol))
        reps = {}
        for s in syms:
            reps.update(dict((v, k) for k, v in posify(s)[1].items()))
        for i, e in enumerate(eq):
            eq[i] = e.subs(reps)
        return f(eq), {r: s for s, r in reps.items()}

    reps = {s: Dummy(s.name, positive=True)
                 for s in eq.free_symbols if s.is_positive is None}
    eq = eq.subs(reps)
    return eq, {r: s for s, r in reps.items()}

```


==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

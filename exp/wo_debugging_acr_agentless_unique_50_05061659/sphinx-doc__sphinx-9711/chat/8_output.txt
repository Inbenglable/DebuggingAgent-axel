To resolve the issue, I need to inspect the method implementation responsible for checking extension versions. The given output suggests that the problematic version check might occur in a `check_extension_version` function in a file named `reproduce.py`. However, the function is likely simulated for reproduction purposes. Since we're dealing with the Sphinx codebase, the actual implementation of version checks could reside elsewhere, possibly within the `sphinx.versioning` module or related modules.

To proceed, I'll search for the `needs_extensions` functionality within the Sphinx project codebase to locate the exact method where the version strings are being improperly compared.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("needs_extensions")
search_code_in_codebase("needs_extensions")
search_code_in_codebase("check_extension_version")
```

To determine whether the issue is resolved, let's review the patch and analyze the test outputs.

### Review of the Patch

**Patch Explanation:**
1. **First Change:**
   - Modifies the condition to check if scientific notation should be used. After the patch, scientific notation is used only if `decimal_pos` is `None`.
   
2. **Second Change:**
   - Adds a condition to return a zero formatted according to `decimal_pos` if the number is extremely small (i.e., the exponent is larger in magnitude than `decimal_pos`).

These changes aim to avoid scientific notation for very small numbers when `decimal_pos` is specified.

### Analysis of the Test Outputs

**Original Output:**
- The test was unable to complete due to a configuration issue with Django settings (`ImproperlyConfigured` error). The test never reached the point where it could verify the output of the number format function.

**Patched Output:**
- The same configuration issue still occurs (`ImproperlyConfigured` error), preventing the test from checking the functionality of the patched code.

### Conclusion

Since the test is failing due to an environment configuration issue (specifically, Django settings are not configured), the patch's efficacy in solving the bug cannot be assessed. The testing framework needs to be correctly set up to evaluate the patch's impact on small decimal number formatting.

**Final Assessment:**
- Given that the configuration issue persists and the test never executes the relevant code to verify the formatting behavior, we cannot determine that the bug is fixed.

Issue resolved: `False`

To determine whether the issue is resolved, let's review the patch and the test outputs:

1. **Patch Review**:
   The patch attempts to fix the issue by adjusting how random seeds are generated for different `n_jobs` configurations. The intention is to keep the reproducibility consistent by ensuring the same seeds are used, regardless of whether multiple jobs are used or not.

   The patch introduces a conditional where if `n_jobs > 1`, it uses the original method of generating seeds (a single call to `random_state.randint` with a size argument), otherwise it manually generates a list of seeds by iteratively calling `random_state.randint`. The goal is to maintain consistent seed generation across different `n_jobs` settings.

2. **Test Output Before the Patch**:
   The original output shows an `AssertionError`, indicating that the inertia values are different when `n_jobs` is set to different values.

3. **Test Output After the Patch**:
   Despite the patch, the test output remains the same, showing an `AssertionError`. This indicates that the patch did not resolve the discrepancy in inertia values when using different `n_jobs` values.

The consistency in test outputs before and after the patch suggests that the issue is not resolved.

**Conclusion**: Issue resolved: `False`

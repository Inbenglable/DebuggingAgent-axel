Based on the issue description, we are looking for the implementation related to client operations in the PostgreSQL backend of Django, specifically within Django's database backends. The results from the API invocation are:

1. `tests/template_tests/views.py:client`: This appears to be a test view related to a client within Djangoâ€™s tests for templates. It is unrelated to the PostgreSQL backend client operations.

2. `django/utils/autoreload.py:WatchmanReloader.client`: This seems to be related to Django's autoreloading functionality and involves the `pywatchman` client. This is also unrelated to the PostgreSQL backend client operations.

Neither of the returned contents from the API invocation is relevant to the PostgreSQL backend client operation in Django. We are looking for something specifically within `django.db.backends.postgresql` or similar, which directly manages the client interactions.

Therefore, there are no contents from the returned API results that are needed in this context.

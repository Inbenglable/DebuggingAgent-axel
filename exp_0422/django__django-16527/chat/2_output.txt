Analyzing the test output, the issue is a `KeyError` being raised within the `submit_row` method. This error occurs when the context dictionary does not contain the key 'has_view_permission', which the code attempts to access.

The test case tries to access the `submit_row` function, which is located in the file `django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py`. The error is triggered because of a missing dictionary key in the `context` object.

Given this analysis, the buggy method is where the exception is raised due to this missing key.

Buggy method: `django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py:submit_row`

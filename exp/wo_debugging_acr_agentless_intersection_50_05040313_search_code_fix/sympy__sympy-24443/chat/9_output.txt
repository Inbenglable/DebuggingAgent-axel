To address the issue with the `_check_homomorphism` function for `PermutationGroup`, I'll simplify the `_image` function to properly handle inverted generators in permutations. 

Here's the patch that should resolve the issue:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                elif s**-1 in images:\n                    w = w*images[s**-1]**power\n=======\n                elif isinstance(domain, PermutationGroup) and r[i]**-1 in gens:\n                    s = domain.generators[gens.index(r[i]**-1)].inverse()\n                    w = w*images[s]**power\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation:

- We modified the logic to explicitly handle cases where a generator or its inverse might be involved. Specifically, when `r[i]` is not in `gens`, we check if its inverse is and handle it accordingly to ensure that both forms are properly detected.
- The replacement addresses the logic where inverted generators weren't identified correctly, which led to the `ValueError` observed in the code snippet shared.

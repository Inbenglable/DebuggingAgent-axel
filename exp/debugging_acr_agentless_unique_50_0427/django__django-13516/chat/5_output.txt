The patch aimed to fix the TypeError encountered due to the incorrect usage of the `captured_output` function. Initially, the function was called with two positional arguments, which caused the error. The patch removed these arguments and attempted to call `captured_output()` without parameters, assuming it would correctly handle both `stdout` and `stderr`. However, the patched output indicates another TypeError because `captured_output()` still requires at least one argument: 'stream_name'.

Given the error encountered after applying the patch, it's clear that the issue with the `captured_output()` usage is not resolved. The function is still being called incorrectly, leading to runtime errors similar to the original unpatched state.

Issue resolved: `False`

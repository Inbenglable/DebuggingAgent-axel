Based on the issue description, we need to fix the bug in the `kahane_simplify` function. To generate the patch, we need to locate and retrieve the source code for this method in the sympy project. Since the file path is not specified in the issue, we will search for the method in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("kahane_simplify")
```

To resolve the issue, I first need to examine the implementation that handles the insertion of type hints into the documentation generated by the `autodoc` extension, particularly where the `autodoc_typehints = "description"` option affects the output. I need to identify the relevant section of the codebase that processes the type hints for methods and classes when this configuration option is set. 

Therefore, I will retrieve the source code for methods responsible for handling or processing typehints in `autodoc`. This typically resides in the Sphinx extensions area, particularly within `sphinx.ext.autodoc`.

Let's go ahead and locate these methods to understand how the type hint for the return type is processed or incorrectly applied for classes.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("add_directive_header")
search_method_in_codebase("get_type_hints")
search_class_in_codebase("Documenter")
```

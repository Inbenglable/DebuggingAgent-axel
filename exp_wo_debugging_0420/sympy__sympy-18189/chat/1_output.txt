The problem arises due to the way the `diophantine` function processes the input symbols and their permutation. To resolve the issue, it is likely necessary to review the implementation of the `diophantine` function to understand how the permutations of symbols are being handled, especially when the `permute=True` flag is used. 

I will search for the `diophantine` function in the sympy project to examine its source code and determine what changes are needed to address the discrepancy in results caused by the order of symbols.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("diophantine")
```

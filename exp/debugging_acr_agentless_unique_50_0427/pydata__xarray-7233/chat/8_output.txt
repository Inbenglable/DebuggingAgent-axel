The source code for the `Coarsen.construct` method has been retrieved. Analyzing this code snippet, it becomes clear that the primary issue is the exclusion of non-dimensional coordinates such as `'day'` from being preserved as coordinates.

To resolve the issue, the logic determining `should_be_coords` needs to be adjusted to account for non-dimensional coordinates that were part of the original object.

I have gathered enough information and am ready to generate the patch. 

Ready generation: `True`

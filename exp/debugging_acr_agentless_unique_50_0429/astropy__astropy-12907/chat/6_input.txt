## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Modeling's `separability_matrix` does not compute separability correctly for nested CompoundModels
Consider the following model:

```python
from astropy.modeling import models as m
from astropy.modeling.separable import separability_matrix

cm = m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)
```

It's separability matrix as you might expect is a diagonal:

```python
>>> separability_matrix(cm)
array([[ True, False],
       [False,  True]])
```

If I make the model more complex:
```python
>>> separability_matrix(m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5))
array([[ True,  True, False, False],
       [ True,  True, False, False],
       [False, False,  True, False],
       [False, False, False,  True]])
```

The output matrix is again, as expected, the outputs and inputs to the linear models are separable and independent of each other.

If however, I nest these compound models:
```python
>>> separability_matrix(m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm)
array([[ True,  True, False, False],
       [ True,  True, False, False],
       [False, False,  True,  True],
       [False, False,  True,  True]])
```
Suddenly the inputs and outputs are no longer separable?

This feels like a bug to me, but I might be missing something?

This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
The provided test script is trying to verify the behavior of the `separability_matrix()` method from `astropy.modeling.separable`. The issue is that when combining models into nested compound models, the expected separability matrix doesn't match the computed matrix, specifically when using the Pix2Sky_TAN model nested with another compound model.

Analyzing the given information:

1. **Model Definition:**
   - `cm = m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)` results in a separability matrix where inputs and outputs are independent.
   - `nested_cm = m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm` is supposed to maintain separability, but the computed matrix does not match the expected separability matrix.

2. **Expected vs. Actual Behavior:**
   - Expected separability for the `nested_cm`:
     ```
     [[True, True, False, False],
      [True, True, False, False],
      [False, False, True, False],
      [False, False, False, True]]
     ```
   - Computed separability for the `nested_cm`:
     ```
     [[True, True, False, False],
      [True, True, False, False],
      [False, False, True, True],
      [False, False, True, True]]
     ```

The behavior of the `separability_matrix()` function seems not to respect the expected separable behavior when dealing with nested compound models. I will need to observe the logic applied within the `separability_matrix()` which likely involves the compound models handling and coordination of inputs and outputs between model elements.

Therefore, the next step is to observe the method responsible for calculating separability within `separability_matrix()` or its related component that handles compound modeling.

Observed method: `astropy/modeling/separable.py:_separable`
==================================================
The method `_separable` function is part of the logic that calculates the separability of outputs for a given model or compound model. The issue here arises because when the separability matrix is calculated, the expected behavior for nested compound models is not achieved.

### Analysis of the Current Observed Code:

1. **Function `_separable`:**
   - This function takes a `transform` object as input, which can either be a simple model or a compound model.
   - It checks if the transform already has a precomputed separability matrix via `_calculate_separability_matrix()`. If it's there, it's used directly; otherwise, it proceeds with further calculations.
   - If the transform is a `CompoundModel`, it recursively computes separability using its `left` and `right` components.
   - It seems to use `_coord_matrix` for normal `Model` instances, which helps create a basic coordinate matrix for linear models.

2. **Observed Problem:**
   - The main issue occurs specifically when dealing with nested compound models. 
   - The computed separability matrix does not align with expectations, indicating that the logic handling nested compound models might not correctly account for the structure and hierarchy of such models.

3. **Runtime Information:**
   - Execution did flow correctly to different branches depending on whether the transform is a `CompoundModel` or a `Model`.
   - However, for the nested compound model, the output does not match the expected separability matrix, implying a logical gap in handling nested structures.

### Next Steps

Since the problem lies in how the logic is combining the results of nested components, we should investigate how the operators for combining separability matrices are applied and possibly incorrect handling of nested structures.

We need to look specifically at the operator logic in `_operators`, which applies operations based on the combination (`&`) of separability matrices for the left and right models in the compound structure.

### Proposed Observation

Let's delve deeper into how separability for compound models is calculated. We should examine the scope of the return line where `_operators[transform.op]` is applied:

```python
Observed scope: `astropy/modeling/separable.py:306-309`
```

This should give insight into how separability is being finalized for compound models and where nested logic might be mishandled.
==================================================
Analyzing the traced code execution reveals that the method `_separable` in `astropy/modeling/separable.py` is responsible for calculating the separability matrix. However, the issue arises due to the improper handling of nested `CompoundModel` instances using the `_cstack` operator. This operator is expected to determine how separability matrices of compound models are combined, affecting the separability matrix structure.

### Observations:
1. **Problematic Behavior**: The logic inside `_cstack`, used to combine the separability matrices of nested models, results in unexpected non-separable output when models are nested. This indicates that the way matrices are combined doesn't preserve the separability for nested models correctly.

2. **Test Results**: The computed separability matrix has unexpected values because the matrices of nested compound models are not preserved appropriately during the combination using `_cstack`.

Based on these observations, it is likely that the buggy behavior originates from the `_cstack` operator's implementation within the `_operators` dictionary. This operator should be ensuring proper separability behavior for nested models, but it seems to be mishandling them instead.

### Next Steps:
It is now crucial to further investigate the `_cstack` operatorâ€™s functionality and logic to pinpoint the potential flaw in handling nested structures correctly. This may involve observing how `_cstack` defines matrix stacking procedures and coordinates within `astropy/modeling/separable.py`.

Hence, to trace deeper into the problem, I will now observe the `_cstack` operator in order to locate any deviations or mistakes in computation.

```plaintext
Observed method: `astropy/modeling/separable.py:_cstack`
```
==================================================


Now you choose downstream method _cstack to further observe, tracing the abnormal program behavior.
This is the method code:
   219	def _cstack(left, right):
   220	    """
   221	    Function corresponding to '&' operation.
   222	
   223	    Parameters
   224	    ----------
   225	    left, right : `astropy.modeling.Model` or ndarray
   226	        If input is of an array, it is the output of `coord_matrix`.
   227	
   228	    Returns
   229	    -------
   230	    result : ndarray
   231	        Result from this operation.
   232	
   233	    """
   234	    noutp = _compute_n_outputs(left, right)
   235	
   236	    if isinstance(left, Model):
   237	        cleft = _coord_matrix(left, 'left', noutp)
   238	    else:
   239	        cleft = np.zeros((noutp, left.shape[1]))
   240	        cleft[: left.shape[0], : left.shape[1]] = left
   241	    if isinstance(right, Model):
   242	        cright = _coord_matrix(right, 'right', noutp)
   243	    else:
   244	        cright = np.zeros((noutp, right.shape[1]))
   245	        cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = 1
   246	
   247	    return np.hstack([cleft, cright])


This is the runtime information of _cstack:

The source code of the `evalf` method in `sympy/core/evalf.py` has been retrieved, which is the key method where the bug occurs. The issue arises because `reprec` and `imprec` are not assigned in certain conditions, leading to an `UnboundLocalError`. The suggestion in the issue description—adding `else: raise NotImplementedError` to handle cases where `reprec` and `imprec` are not set—seems appropriate to ensure these variables are properly handled.

Therefore, considering the information from the API call output and the issue description, I now have enough information to generate a patch for this problem.

Ready generation: `True`

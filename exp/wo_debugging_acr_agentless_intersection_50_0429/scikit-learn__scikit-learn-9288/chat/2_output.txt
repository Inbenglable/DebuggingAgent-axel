To resolve the issue with `KMeans`, where there's a discrepancy in results based on the number of parallel jobs, it's important to examine the code parallelization logic specifically in the `fit` method of the `KMeans` class.

Next, I'll retrieve the source code for the `fit` method in the `KMeans` class to inspect any parallel processing logic that might lead to inconsistencies in results.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/cluster/k_means_.py", "KMeans.fit")
```

To fix the issue, I need to review the source code of the `RenameContentType` class, particularly the `_rename` method that resides in the `django/contrib/contenttypes/management/__init__.py` file. This will allow me to confirm the specific lines of code requiring modification. Therefore, I will retrieve the source code of the `_rename` method within the `RenameContentType` class from the specified file.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/contrib/contenttypes/management/__init__.py", "RenameContentType")
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/contenttypes/management/__init__.py", "RenameContentType._rename")
```

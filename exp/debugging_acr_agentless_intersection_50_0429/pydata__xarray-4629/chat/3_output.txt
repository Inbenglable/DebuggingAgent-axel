Based on the runtime information and the handling of attributes during merging, it appears that the issue lies in how the `merge_attrs` function reads and processes the attributes when `combine_attrs='override'`.

The observed snippet of code calls `merge_attrs` with a list of attribute dictionaries from the datasets. The logic in `merge_attrs` should be responsible for handling these attributes correctly, ensuring they are copied rather than referenced. However, the information extracted suggests that the incorrect reference led to the change in `xds1.attrs['a']` to 'd' unexpectedly.

Therefore, the issue is likely within the `merge_attrs` function's handling of the `combine_attrs='override'` case, where the first set of attributes is not being copied correctly.

Buggy method: `xarray/core/merge.py:merge_attrs`

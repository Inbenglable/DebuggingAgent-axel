To address the issue of dropping support for SQLite versions older than 3.9.0, I need to modify the `check_sqlite_version` function(s) to reflect this new minimum version requirement. Since I have identified the relevant methods, I will need to retrieve the source code of the `check_sqlite_version` function in the `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py` file to apply the necessary changes.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py", "check_sqlite_version")
```

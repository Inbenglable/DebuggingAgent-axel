To resolve the issue where an index entry has parens for a `py:method` directive with the `:property:` option, I need to investigate how the index entries are generated currently and determine where the logic needs adjustment to ensure properties are indexed correctly without parens.

The focus should be on the code responsible for registering index entries for directives with the property option, specifically for `py:method` implementations. I will start by searching for relevant portions of code related to indexing method directives with property options. This will involve searching for the method responsible for handling indexing in `sphinx`.

Since I don't have specific file paths connected to the index feature directly from the information provided, I will first use a codebase-wide search to locate the logic linked to indexing.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("add_index")
search_method_in_codebase("handle_signature")
```

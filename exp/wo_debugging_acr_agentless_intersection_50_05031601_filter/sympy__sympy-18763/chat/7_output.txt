To resolve the issue, we need to locate and modify the `_latex` method responsible for formatting the LaTeX representation of `Subs` objects. The method is likely implemented in the `sympy/printing/latex.py` file. I'll first retrieve the `_latex` method from this file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/latex.py", "Subs._latex")
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/latex.py", "_print_Subs")
```

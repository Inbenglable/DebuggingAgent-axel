To address the issue of comparing complex numbers incorrectly in the `_TR56` function, we can modify the conditional checks to ensure that the type of `rv.exp` is properly handled by checking its properties before comparison. The invalid comparisons should check if the expression is a real number before trying to compare.

Here is the patch in SEARCH/REPLACE format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/simplify/fu.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if (rv.exp < 0) == True:\n=======\n        if rv.exp.is_number and rv.exp.is_real and (rv.exp < 0):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### sympy/simplify/fu.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if (rv.exp > max) == True:\n=======\n        if rv.exp.is_number and rv.exp.is_real and (rv.exp > max):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch ensures that we only perform the comparison operations on `rv.exp` if it is both a number and real, thus avoiding the `TypeError` that results from comparing complex numbers.

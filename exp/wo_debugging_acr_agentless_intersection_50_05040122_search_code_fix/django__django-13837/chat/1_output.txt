To address the issue, I need to examine the source code of the `django.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments` method to accurately implement the update described in the issue. Hence, I will use the relevant API to retrieve the source code for the `get_child_arguments` method from the project's codebase.

Let's proceed with searching for this specific method in the codebase. 

```python
search_method_in_codebase("get_child_arguments")
```

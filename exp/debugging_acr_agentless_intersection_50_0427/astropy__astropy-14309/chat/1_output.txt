Analyzing the output and the traces, the identified `IndexError` is occurring in the `is_fits` function from `astropy/io/fits/connect.py`. This function is being called within a loop iterating over identifiers in the `identify_format` method in `astropy/io/registry/base.py`. The problem arises because the `is_fits` function assumes the presence of at least one element in the `args` list, which might not always be the case.

The critical part of the stack trace is:
```
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/astropy__astropy-14309/astropy/io/fits/connect.py", line 72, in is_fits
    return isinstance(args[0], (HDUList, TableHDU, BinTableHDU, GroupsHDU))
IndexError: tuple index out of range
```

This indicates that the code is trying to access `args[0]`, which does not exist.

Buggy method: `astropy/io/fits/connect.py:is_fits`

To address the issue of import ordering in Django migration files, we need to pinpoint where the import generation logic resides in Django's codebase. Normally, this would be part of Django's migration utilities or operations. We need to conduct a search to identify the exact location or method responsible for generating these import statements. Once identified, we can make appropriate changes to ensure compliance with the Django import style guide.

Let's start by looking for relevant methods or classes responsible for generating migration files in Django. 

```python
search_method_in_codebase("write_migration_file")
search_method_in_codebase("generate_migration_imports")
search_class_in_codebase("MigrationWriter")
```

These searches aim to locate potential methods or classes involved in writing or generating migration files, which may include import statements.

To resolve the issue, we need to modify the `hexbin` method within `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py` to ensure consistent behavior of the `mincnt` parameter whether or not the `C` parameter is supplied. Specifically, this involves changing the condition in the list comprehension to include grid points where the number of data points is equal to or greater than `mincnt`, instead of strictly greater than `mincnt`.

Here is the patch that modifies the condition:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                [reduce_C_function(acc) if len(acc) > mincnt else np.nan\n=======\n                [reduce_C_function(acc) if len(acc) >= mincnt else np.nan\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This change specifically makes the `hexbin` method apply `reduce_C_function` when the count is equal to or exceeds `mincnt`, thereby ensuring that grid points with exactly `mincnt` count are also displayed, aligning the behavior when `C` is supplied with the behavior when `C` is `None`.

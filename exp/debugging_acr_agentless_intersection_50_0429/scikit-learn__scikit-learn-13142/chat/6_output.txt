To resolve the issue, I need to understand how the `BaseMixture.fit_predict` method is implemented, specifically around how it handles `n_init` and the final E-step. Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code for this method.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/mixture/base.py", "BaseMixture.fit_predict")
```

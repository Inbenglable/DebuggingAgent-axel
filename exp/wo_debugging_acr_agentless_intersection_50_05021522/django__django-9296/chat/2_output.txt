To implement the `__iter__` method in the `Paginator` class, I need to access the source code for the `page_range` property, which will be used within this method. Therefore, I'll retrieve the source code for the `page_range`.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/paginator.py", "Paginator.page_range")
```

The patch is designed to modify the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method so that it can properly handle functions where all arguments are dimensionless, specifically for the exponential function `exp`. Here's a breakdown of what the patch does:

1. It inspects expressions that are instances of `Function`.
2. It collects the dimensions of the arguments of the function.
3. It checks if all argument dimensions are dimensionless.
4. If all arguments are dimensionless (as expected for functions like `exp`), it returns the function result with a dimension of `Dimension(1)` to indicate dimensionlessness.
5. Otherwise, it returns the function result with the dimensions collected from the arguments.

Before the patch, executing the test raised a `ValueError` indicating that `exp(second/(farad*ohm))` was incorrectly calculated to have a dimension. This issue was highlighted by an assertion error stating that the dimension should instead be dimensionless.

After the patch, the output from running the test is empty, which typically indicates that no errors were raised. This suggests that the patch allows `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(buggy_expr)` to execute without raising a `ValueError`, accomplishing the goal of properly recognizing that the expression should be dimensionless.

Therefore, based on the information provided about the outputs before and after applying the patch, it appears that the issue has been resolved.

Issue resolved: `True`

To resolve the issue, I'll modify the comparison logic in the `_TR56` function to handle complex exponents appropriately. Here is the proposed patch in the SEARCH/REPLACE format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/simplify/fu.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if (rv.exp < 0) == True:\n=======\n        if rv.exp.is_number and rv.exp.is_real and (rv.exp < 0):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch changes the comparison to check if `rv.exp` is a number and is real before performing the comparison, thus avoiding a `TypeError` when dealing with complex exponents.

Now You need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
floatformat() crashes on "0.00".
Description
	
from decimal import Decimal
from django.template.defaultfilters import floatformat
floatformat('0.00', 0)
floatformat(Decimal('0.00'), 0)
Both throw ValueError: valid range for prec is [1, MAX_PREC]

</ISSUE>


A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
To diagnose the problem, we need to analyze where and why the `floatformat()` function behaves unexpectedly when the provided input value is `"0.00"` and the precision argument is `0`.

The trace indicates that the problem arises in the line of code:

```python
rounded_d = d.quantize(exp, ROUND_HALF_UP, Context(prec=prec))
```

Here, `prec` is calculated based on the `units` and the absolute value of `p`, resulting in `prec=0`. However, the valid range for `prec` in `Context` is `[1, MAX_PREC]`, which leads to a `ValueError` when `prec=0` is encountered.

Given the traceback, let's look at the calculations and logic surrounding this line more closely; the following lines and calculations are of interest:

```python
units = len(tupl[1])
units += -tupl[2] if m else tupl[2]
prec = abs(p) + units + 1
```

Given that `m` evaluates to `False`, the second part of the conditional logic will be used, leading to `units` being modified further. However, it's essential to ensure that `prec` doesn't fall outside the valid range.

Since the issue is manifesting at this point, and the floatformat function is the one being directly tested, this would be the appropriate place to targeting fixing the observed issue.

Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude:
Buggy method: `django/template/defaultfilters.py:floatformat`
==================================================


Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

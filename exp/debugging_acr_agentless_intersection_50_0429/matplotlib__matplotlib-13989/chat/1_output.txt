Given the provided information, the error arises when we attempt to use `plt.hist()` with the `range` parameter specified and `density=True`. The expectation is that the first and last bin edges should align with the specified range `(0, 1)`, but they currently do not.

The erroneous behavior seems related to the histogram plotting functionality, specifically in how the bins are calculated when `density=True` is specified. The report indicated that the issue bisects to a particular commit, which could have induced a regression in the histogram calculation logic.

To proceed with identifying the root cause, we should explore how the bin calculation and normalization are handled within the `hist` function or relevant utility functions that it might call. This is likely encompassed within `matplotlib.pyplot.hist` or within the respective axes method `matplotlib.axes.Axes.hist`.

Next, we need to examine how these methods or helper functions handle the `range` parameter in conjunction with `density=True`.

Observed method: `lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py:hist`

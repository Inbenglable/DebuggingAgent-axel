To resolve the issue, I need to adjust the handling of the 'to' field in the `generate_renamed_models` method within the `MigrationAutodetector` class. I have a reference to this method in the traceback, and I know its file is 'django/db/migrations/autodetector.py'. Before generating the patch, I need to retrieve the source code of the method `generate_renamed_models`.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/autodetector.py", "MigrationAutodetector.generate_renamed_models")
```

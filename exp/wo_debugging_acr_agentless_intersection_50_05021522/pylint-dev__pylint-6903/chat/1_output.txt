To address the issue, I need to examine the `_query_cpu` function's implementation to understand its current behavior and logic for calculating the number of CPUs. This will help me make informed modifications to prevent returning zero CPUs and handle cases in Kubernetes Pods effectively.

I'll start by retrieving the source code of the `_query_cpu` method in the `pylint/lint/run.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("pylint/lint/run.py", "_query_cpu")
```

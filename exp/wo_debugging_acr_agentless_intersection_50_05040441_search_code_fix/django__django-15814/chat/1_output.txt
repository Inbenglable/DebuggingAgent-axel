To address the reported issue, we need to modify the line in the Django source code at `django/db/models/sql/query.py` on line 745, where `opts = cur_model._meta` is set. 

To fully understand the implementation and ensure that the patch is correct, we should retrieve the surrounding code of this particular line number to effectively apply the fix and see how it fits into the context.

Let's search for this snippet around the specified file.

```python
search_code_in_file("django/db/models/sql/query.py", "opts = cur_model._meta")
```

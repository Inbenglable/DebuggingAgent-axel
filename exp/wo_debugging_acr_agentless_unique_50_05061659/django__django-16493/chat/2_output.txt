To address the issue, I need to verify the definition and context of the `FileField` class in the specified `files.py` file. This will help ensure that any changes made to the `deconstruct` method are aligned with the overall structure and purpose of the class. Therefore, I will proceed to retrieve the full implementation of the `FileField` class.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/fields/files.py", "FileField")
```

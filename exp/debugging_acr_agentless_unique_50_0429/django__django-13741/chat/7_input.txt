## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Set disabled prop on ReadOnlyPasswordHashField
Description
	
Currently the django.contrib.auth.forms.UserChangeForm defines a clean_password method that returns the initial password value to prevent (accidental) changes to the password value. It is also documented that custom forms for the User model need to define this method: ​https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/auth/customizing/#a-full-example
A while ago the forms.Field base class gained the ​disabled argument to:
[disable] a form field using the disabled HTML attribute so that it won’t be editable by users. Even if a user tampers with the field’s value submitted to the server, it will be ignored in favor of the value from the form’s initial data.
It seems to me that this property could be set to True be default on the ReadOnlyPasswordHashField used to display the password hash. This way the clean_password is no longer necessary and the potential pitfall when using the ReadOnlyPasswordHashField without implementing clean_password is removed.

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
The observed issue occurs due to missing `test_settings` module as seen in the traceback. This module name is set in the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable, influencing the Django setup process.

In the given reproducible test, the line `os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'test_settings')` assumes a settings module named `test_settings`, but it is not provided, resulting in a `ModuleNotFoundError`.

Here's the breakdown of the process:

1. **Setup error**: During the Django initialization with `django.setup()`, the framework attempts to load settings specified by the environment variable. Because `test_settings` isn't available, it fails at `django/conf/__init__.py:__getattr__` while trying to access log configurations via `settings`.

Observing deeper into Django's settings module handling is required to understand why the absence leads directly to a failure during setup.

Observed method: `django/conf/__init__.py:LazySettings._setup`
==================================================
From the runtime information provided, the issue arises because the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable is set to `'test_settings'`, which does not exist, leading to a `ModuleNotFoundError`. The test setup process attempts to load settings defined by the `ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE`, which is supposed to point to a valid Django settings module.

Let's analyze the observed code:

The method being traced is `LazySettings._setup` within the Django configuration system (`django/conf/__init__.py`). It locates the settings module specified by the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` variable and attempts to wrap it within the `Settings` class.

The steps are as follows:
1. **Line 61** gets the settings module name from the environment variable.
2. **Line 70** attempts to initialize `self._wrapped` with the settings module. This step fails because the settings module (`test_settings`) cannot be found, raising a `ModuleNotFoundError`.

The abnormal behavior occurs because the settings module specified does not exist. This isn't directly related to the feature request of adding the `disabled` attribute to `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField`.

The resolution steps are:
- Fix the environment setup in the test by ensuring that we specify a valid settings module.
- Implement the feature request to set `disabled=True` by default in the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField`.

Given the details, the issue can be addressed in the following method in the Django codebase:

Buggy method: `django/contrib/auth/forms.py:ReadOnlyPasswordHashField`

This forms file contains the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` where the `disabled` attribute should be set by default. Now, you should modify this field by setting `disabled=True` by default within its initialization code if it isn't already enforced. If you need help implementing this change, let me know!
==================================================

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To address the issue effectively, I should retrieve the exact implementation of the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` in the `django/contrib/auth/forms.py` file. Once I have the source code, I can proceed to implement the default `disabled=True` feature for this field.

Let's retrieve the source code for `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField`:

```python
search_class_in_file("django/contrib/auth/forms.py", "ReadOnlyPasswordHashField")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_class_in_file("django/contrib/auth/forms.py", "ReadOnlyPasswordHashField")
RESULT:
#### django/contrib/auth/forms.py:ReadOnlyPasswordHashField
```python
class ReadOnlyPasswordHashField(forms.Field):
    widget = ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        ...

    def bound_data(self, data, initial):
        ...

    def has_changed(self, initial, data):
        ...
```


==================================================

Your Output:
To generate the patch for setting the `disabled=True` by default for the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField`, I need to retrieve the source code for the `__init__` method of the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` class. 

Let's search for the `__init__` method within the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` class in the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/auth/forms.py", "ReadOnlyPasswordHashField.__init__")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_file("django/contrib/auth/forms.py", "ReadOnlyPasswordHashField.__init__")
RESULT:
#### django/contrib/auth/forms.py:ReadOnlyPasswordHashField.__init__
```python
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        kwargs.setdefault("required", False)
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

```


==================================================

Your Output:
Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

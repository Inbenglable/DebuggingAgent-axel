To determine whether the issue is resolved, let's go through the patch and the test outputs step-by-step:

### Patch Analysis
- The patch modifies the `get_context_data()` method by explicitly converting `offer_slug` from `kwargs` to a string: 
  ```python
  offer_slug = str(kwargs.get("offer_slug", ""))
  ```
- This conversion is intended to resolve the issue where `offer_slug` is of type `SimpleLazyObject`, which causes a crash with Django 3.1 when used in `get_object_or_404`.

### Test Output Analysis Before Patch
- The original output shows an `ImproperlyConfigured` error regarding `INSTALLED_APPS`. This error indicates that Django's settings were not properly configured before the test began.
- This error is unrelated to the conversion issue and needs to be addressed to correctly test the patch.

### Test Output Analysis After Patch
- The patched output is identical to the original output, showing the same `ImproperlyConfigured` error.
- Since the configuration error persists, the test is not successfully reaching the point where the `offer_slug` conversion takes place.
- Therefore, it's not possible to verify if the patch itself resolves the template view crash issue, as the test is not running correctly due to the settings configuration problem.

### Conclusion
- Since the test is not executing the code needed to verify the behavior of `offer_slug` due to the settings misconfiguration, the issue resolution can't be properly determined.
- The `ImproperlyConfigured` error needs to be fixed in the test setup before the patch can be correctly evaluated.

Issue resolved: `False`

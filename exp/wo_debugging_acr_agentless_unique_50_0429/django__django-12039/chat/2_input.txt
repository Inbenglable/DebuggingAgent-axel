Now You need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Use proper whitespace in CREATE INDEX statements
Description
	 
		(last modified by Hannes Ljungberg)
	 
Creating an index through:
index = Index(
	fields=['-name’],
	name='idx'
)
Will generate the valid but not so pretty CREATE INDEX statement: 
CREATE INDEX "idx" ON "schema_author" ("name"DESC)
The following would be expected:
CREATE INDEX "idx" ON "schema_author" ("name" DESC)
This was partially fixed for indexes using opclasses in https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/30903#ticket but it introduced a new quirk when opclasses is used without explicit ordering:
index = Index(
	fields=['name’],
	name='idx'
	opclasses=['text_pattern_ops’]
)
Will result in:
CREATE INDEX "idx" ON "schema_author" (“name” text_pattern_ops )
Note the whitespace after text_pattern_ops. When used with a descending order it will look correct. 
Unfortunately in the fix in #30903 it was assumed that the col_suffixes passed to django.db.backends.ddl_references.Columns would be empty for ascending order but instead it will contain empty strings and thus causing this bug. See: ​https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/db/backends/ddl_references.py#L87
The expected output would be:
CREATE INDEX "idx" ON "schema_author" (“name” text_pattern_ops)

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue described, I need to review the relevant source code related to the generation of SQL statements for index creation in Django. The primary area to investigate would be the code responsible for handling the ordering logic and opclasses in index creation.

The description points to a specific location in the codebase: `django/db/backends/ddl_references.py`. The likely relevant component is the `Columns` class, which seems to be involved in formatting SQL statements for index creation. I will first search for the `Columns` class in `ddl_references.py`.

Additionally, if the `Columns` class has methods related to suffixes or SQL generation, those should be examined to identify where the bug is occurring.

Here's the plan:
1. Identify the `Columns` class in `ddl_references.py`.
2. Explore key methods within this class that might pertain to suffix handling and SQL formatting.

Let's proceed with searching the relevant class and methods to gain further insights.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/backends/ddl_references.py", "Columns")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_class_in_file("django/db/backends/ddl_references.py", "Columns")
RESULT:
#### django/db/backends/ddl_references.py:Columns
```python
class Columns(TableColumns):
    """Hold a reference to one or many columns."""

    def __init__(self, table, columns, quote_name, col_suffixes=()):
        ...

    def __str__(self):
        ...
```


==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

To address the issue, I need to further investigate the `ClassDocumenter` class and its `add_directive_header` method, as well as identify any related methods involved in processing the constructor's signature and type hints. I'll begin by retrieving more detailed source code for the `ClassDocumenter` class to understand its context and functionality better. Additionally, I need to check if there are any methods specifically responsible for constructor signature handling or type hint formatting.

```python
search_class_in_file("sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py", "ClassDocumenter")
```
Once I've reviewed the `ClassDocumenter` code, I'll be able to determine if any adjustments are needed to prevent displaying return types in class documentation when `autodoc_typehints` is set to `"description"`.

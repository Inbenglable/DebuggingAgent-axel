To determine whether the issue is resolved, we need to analyze the patched behavior against the original issue description.

### Issue Summary
The original issue described that when running pytest with `--pdb`, the `tearDown` method is executed even when a test is skipped. This should not happen, and the expected behavior is for the `tearDown` method to remain unexecuted for skipped tests when `--pdb` is used.

### Original Output
The original output after applying the reproduction test showed an error because the reproduction file was not found, which means no tests were run, and the issue wasn't properly demonstrated.

### Patch Content
The patch modifies the `item.runtest()` and `item.session._setupstate.teardown_exact(item, nextitem)` calls in `src/_pytest/runner.py`. It checks whether the test should be skipped using `item._evalskip()` and whether the `--pdb` option is active, ensuring that neither `runtest()` nor `teardown_exact` are called if the test is skipped.

### Patched Output
The output after the patch was applied didn't show any tests being collected or executed because of an error related to a missing reproduction file. The parsed file path was incorrect, which means no tests were run.

### Analysis
The patch intends to prevent tests from running `tearDown` when they are skipped and the `--pdb` flag is active. However, due to a setup issue, we are unable to observe the output of running the actual test because the tests were not found or executed both before and after applying the patch. Consequently, there's no concrete evidence of whether the patch correctly alters the behavior.

### Determination
Since the reproduced test did not run properly in both the original and patched circumstances due to the file missing error, there is no observable change or evidence that confirms the patch fixed the intended issue.

Issue resolved: `False`

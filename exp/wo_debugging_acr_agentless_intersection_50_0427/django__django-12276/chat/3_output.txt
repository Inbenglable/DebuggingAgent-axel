Based on the information obtained, we understand the following:

1. `ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute()` is already defined and currently resides in the `ClearableFileInput` class with the logic: `return super().use_required_attribute(initial) and not initial`.
2. `FileInput` is a class that inherits from `Input`.
3. Within the `Input` class, the `use_required_attribute()` method is not specifically mentioned in the details retrieved thus far, so it must be inherited further up in the hierarchy or may need default implementation.

To generate the patch to move the `use_required_attribute()` method to the `FileInput` class, ensuring accurate functionality is transferred:

- We need to confirm if `use_required_attribute` appears further up the hierarchy or if it's a method to be newly implemented.
- Validate that method functionality aligns with the proposal: not setting the required attribute when initial data is present in `FileInput`.

To proceed effectively with this plan:
- First, check if `use_required_attribute` is implemented in the `Widget` class, the base class for `Input`.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "Widget.use_required_attribute")
search_class_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "Widget")
```

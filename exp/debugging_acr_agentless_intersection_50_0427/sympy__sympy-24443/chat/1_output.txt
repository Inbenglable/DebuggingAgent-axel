Analyzing the output reveals that the problem lies in the `_check_homomorphism` function within the `sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py` file, as this function raises a `ValueError` indicating that the given images do not define a homomorphism. The generator and image lists should match appropriately based on the group homomorphism rules, and a part of this logic is likely failing.

Let's first locate where this method is used before execution continues and leads to the exception.

Observed method: `sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py:_check_homomorphism`

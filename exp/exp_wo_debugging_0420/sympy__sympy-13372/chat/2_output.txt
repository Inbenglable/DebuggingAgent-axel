To address the issue of `UnboundLocalError` related to `reprec` and `imprec` in the `evalf` function when dealing with a `Mul` expression containing `Max`, we should inspect the portion of the code in `evalf` where these variables are supposed to be assigned. It appears that these variables are only set under certain conditions, but not others, which may lead to situations where they are later referenced without being initialized.

The traceback indicates that the error comes from unhandled cases when arguments are not either `re` or `im`. To handle these cases, we can add an `else` clause to raise a `NotImplementedError` if neither `re` nor `im` is handled, as suggested in the issue report.

Given that I have already retrieved the relevant parts of the code for the `evalf` and `evalf_mul` functions, I'm ready to generate a patch to resolve the bug properly.

Ready generation: `True`

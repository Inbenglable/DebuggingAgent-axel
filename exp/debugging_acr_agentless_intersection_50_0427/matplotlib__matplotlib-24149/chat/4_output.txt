To fix the issue with all-NaN data raising a `StopIteration` error in the `Axes._convert_dx` method, we need to modify how `_safe_first_finite` is handled when no finite values are found. The fix will involve providing a default return value in case no finite values are present. This will prevent `StopIteration` from being raised and allow the method to handle all-NaN data gracefully.

Let's create the patch in the `SEARCH/REPLACE` format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                x0 = cbook._safe_first_finite(x0)\n=======\n                try:\n                    x0 = cbook._safe_first_finite(x0)\n                except StopIteration:\n                    x0 = np.nan  # or another appropriate default value\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch ensures that if `cbook._safe_first_finite(x0)` raises a `StopIteration` because all values are `NaN`, it will catch the exception and set `x0` to `np.nan`, allowing the function to continue without raising an error.

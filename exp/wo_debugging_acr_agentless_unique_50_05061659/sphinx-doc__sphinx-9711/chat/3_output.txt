To resolve the issue, I need to inspect how the `needs_extensions` function in the Sphinx project handles version comparisons. This would typically involve checking the function or class handling this logic to change the comparison from string-based to version-based. Let's search for the relevant method or class.

Since I don't have direct information on the file paths or the class and method names, I need to search for the method handling this logic within the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("needs_extensions")
```

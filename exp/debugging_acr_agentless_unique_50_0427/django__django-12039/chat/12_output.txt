To fix the whitespace issue in the concatenation process within the `__str__` method of the `Columns` class, I will modify the code so that the column name and its suffix are separated by a space when the suffix is not empty. Here is the patch in the required format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/backends/ddl_references.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                return self.quote_name(column) + self.col_suffixes[idx]\n=======\n                return self.quote_name(column) + (' ' + self.col_suffixes[idx] if self.col_suffixes[idx] else '')\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This change will ensure that a space is added between the column name and its suffix unless the suffix is an empty string, thus resolving the whitespace handling issue observed in the SQL statements.

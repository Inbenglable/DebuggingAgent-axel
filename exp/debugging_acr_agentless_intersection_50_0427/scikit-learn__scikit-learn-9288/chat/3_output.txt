Based on the current observations, the discrepancy is tied to how the seeds for the random states are generated and utilized in parallel versus serial processing. When running the `KMeans` with `n_jobs` more than 1, seeds are generated to ensure that multiple instances run with different seeds, potentially leading to slight differences in results due to randomness. 

I will further investigate the `_kmeans_single_elkan` method that is involved with the actual cluster assignment and inertia calculations, as this would likely be where discrepancies manifest due to the randomness introduced by differing seeds.

The next step is to observe the `_kmeans_single_elkan` function to understand how it processes each individual k-means iteration with potentially different random seeds.

Observed method: `sklearn/cluster/k_means_.py:_kmeans_single_elkan`

The issue lies within the SymPy project's file: `sympy/core/sympify.py` in the function `kernS`. The error occurs because the local variable `kern` is being referenced before it is assigned a value.  

From the traceback and program flow, we see that the problematic line is `hit = kern in s`, where `kern` was never previously defined or assigned within the function scope.

Therefore, the buggy method is identified as:

Buggy method: `sympy/core/sympify.py:kernS`

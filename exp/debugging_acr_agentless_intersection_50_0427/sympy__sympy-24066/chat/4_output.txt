To address the issue, I need to examine the source code of the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method where the problem is likely occurring. First, I will search for the method in the specified file `sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py`.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py", "UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension")
```

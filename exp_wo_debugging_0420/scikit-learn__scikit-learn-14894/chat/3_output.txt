The issue arises due to a division by zero in the computation of `dual_coef_indptr`. This happens because there might be cases where the `support_vectors_` attribute is empty, resulting in `n_SV` being zero. To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_sparse_fit` method to handle such cases appropriately. However, since I've already obtained the source code for the `_sparse_fit` method, no further code retrieval is needed, and I can proceed with generating the patch.

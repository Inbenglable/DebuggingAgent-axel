Here is the patch to fix the issue using the suggested search/replace format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/forms/models.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if fields and f.name not in fields:\n=======\n        if fields is not None and f.name not in fields:\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
``` 

This change ensures that `model_to_dict` returns an empty dictionary when `fields` is an empty list, as it checks explicitly if `fields` is not `None` rather than just checking its truthiness.

Given the issue description, the problem seems to be with the `ds.merge()` method in the `Dataset` class of the **xarray** project. It fails when attempting to merge a `DataArray` object with a `Dataset`.

To generate a patch, I need to review the `merge` method's implementation in the `Dataset` class found in `xarray/core/dataset.py`. Let's retrieve the source code for the `Dataset.merge` method.

```python
search_method_in_file("xarray/core/dataset.py", "Dataset.merge")
```

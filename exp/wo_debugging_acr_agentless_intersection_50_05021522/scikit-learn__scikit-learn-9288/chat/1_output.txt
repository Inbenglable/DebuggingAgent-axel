To address the issue with `KMeans` producing slightly different results based on the `n_jobs` parameter, it is essential to understand how the parallel computation affects the outcome. This likely involves examining the implementation details of the `KMeans` class and its `fit` method to determine where the parallel processing might be causing inconsistencies.

Given that the method in question is `KMeans.fit`, I will begin by searching for the source code of this specific method within its associated class to understand how the parallel computation is executed.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("KMeans")
search_method_in_codebase("KMeans.fit")
```

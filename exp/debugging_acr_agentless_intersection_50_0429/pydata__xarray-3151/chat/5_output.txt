Based on the observed code snippet from `xarray/core/combine.py`, the issue arises in the section that performs checks for monotonicity on global indexes, specifically within the loop across `concatenated.dims`. 

The key consideration here should be whether a coordinate dimension is indeed "non-varying" between datasets. 

In the examined code:
```python
504	        for dim in concatenated.dims:
505	            if dim in concatenated:
506	                indexes = concatenated.indexes.get(dim)
507	                if not (indexes.is_monotonic_increasing
508	                        or indexes.is_monotonic_decreasing):
509	                    raise ValueError("Resulting object does not have monotonic"
510	                                     " global indexes along dimension {}"
511	                                     .format(dim))
```

Lines 507-511 check for monotonicity without verifying if the coordinates along this dimension vary between datasets. This behavior does not align with the documented expectation to ignore non-varying coordinate dimensions for monotonicity.

Given the current understanding, the issue likely resides in the handling within the loop on line 504, where checks on `dim` are erroneously applied even to non-varying coordinate dimensions.

To correct this behavior, the method needs logic to verify whether a dimension's coordinates are identical across datasets before performing the monotonicity check.

Therefore, the buggy method is:

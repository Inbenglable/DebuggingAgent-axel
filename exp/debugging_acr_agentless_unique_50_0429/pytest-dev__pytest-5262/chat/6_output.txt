### Analysis of the Current Observed Code and Abnormal Program Behavior:

1. **Issue Context & Observations**:
   - The error occurs because `youtube_dl` writes `bytes` into the pytest captured output, expecting the mode of the output to be binary since it's misadvertised as `rb+`.
   - The `_pytest.capture.EncodedFile` class is mistakenly using the binary mode of its underlying buffer.

2. **Initial Observational Method**:
   - The `EncodedFile.__init__()` method shows that `buffer` and `encoding` are simply assigned without altering or checking the mode.
   - No indication in `__init__()` that mode is set or advertised.

3. **Hypothesis & Next Steps**:
   - The root of the issue likely lies in how the mode of `EncodedFile` is defined or propagated from the underlying buffer.
   - The mode might be incorrectly reported elsewhere in `EncodedFile`, probably post-initialization or outside this class.

4. **Direction for Tracing**:
   - Instead of focusing on `__init__`, it is potentially effective to trace the usage of the `mode` attribute in relation to `buffer`.
   - Identify where `EncodedFile` interacts with or reports its mode.

Considering the lack of immediate mode adjustments within `__init__`, the deeper examination should focus on interactions or definitions involving `buffer` and any public attributes related to mode, potentially in methods or properties of `EncodedFile`.

### Proceeding to Next Observational Step:

**Observed Scope**: `_pytest/capture.py` should be explored further to locate where the mode propagation might incorrectly define `rb+` outside of `__init__`. Specifically:

Observed scope: `_pytest/capture.py:431-450`

We will seek to find methods or attributes directly referring to `mode`, which may incorrectly project the underlying buffer's mode.

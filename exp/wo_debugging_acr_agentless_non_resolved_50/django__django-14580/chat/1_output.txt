To resolve this issue, I need to first identify the part of the Django codebase responsible for generating migration files, specifically in the module `django.db.migrations.writer`. To accomplish this, I will search for the relevant class or method definitions that play a role in writing migration files.

Let's begin by retrieving the source code for the `writer` module in the Django migrations package:

```python
search_class_in_codebase("writer")
```

This will help in determining where and how to implement the necessary import statement logic for resolving the `NameError` due to missing `models` import.

To analyze which files are relevant to the issue:

1. **sklearn/impute/_base.py:SimpleImputer._sparse_fit**:
   - This method deals with fitting transformers on sparse data and calculating statistics depending on different strategies like 'mean', 'median', etc.
   - **Relevance**: This is associated with data imputation and not related to SVM, hence it's irrelevant to the issue at hand.

2. **sklearn/svm/base.py:BaseLibSVM._sparse_fit**:
   - This method is directly in the `svm` module and contains the operations that handle the sparse SVM fitting, including where the division might occur (`dual_coef_indices.size / n_class`).
   - **Relevance**: This is highly relevant as it directly pertains to the issue with SVM's sparse fitting process.

3. **sklearn/preprocessing/data.py:QuantileTransformer._sparse_fit**:
   - This method deals with computing percentiles for sparse matrices during preprocessing using the `QuantileTransformer`.
   - **Relevance**: This method is part of preprocessing and doesn't pertain to SVM, thus irrelevant to the current issue.

Based on the analysis, the content relevant to the issue is:

```
sklearn/svm/base.py:BaseLibSVM._sparse_fit

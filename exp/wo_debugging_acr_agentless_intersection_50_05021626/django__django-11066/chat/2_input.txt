## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
RenameContentType._rename() doesn't save the content type on the correct database
Description
	
The commit in question:
​https://github.com/django/django/commit/f179113e6cbc8ba0a8d4e87e1d4410fb61d63e75
The specific lines in question:
​https://github.com/django/django/blob/586a9dc4295357de1f5ad0590ad34bf2bc008f79/django/contrib/contenttypes/management/__init__.py#L27
with transaction.atomic(using=db): 
	content_type.save(update_fields={'model'})
The issue:
For some background, we run a dynamic database router and have no "real" databases configured in the settings file, just a default sqlite3 backend which is never actually generated or used. We forked the migrate.py management command and modified it to accept a dictionary containing database connection parameters as the --database argument. 
The dynamic database router is based on, and very similar to this: ​https://github.com/ambitioninc/django-dynamic-db-router/blob/master/dynamic_db_router/router.py
This has worked beautifully for all migrations up until this point.
The issue we're running into is that when attempting to run a migration which contains a call to migrations.RenameModel, and while specifying the database parameters to the migrate command, the migration fails with an OperationalError, stating that no such table: django_content_types exists.
After having exhaustively stepped through the traceback, it appears that even though the content_type.save call is wrapped in the with transaction.atomic(using=db) context manager, the actual database operation is being attempted on the default database (which in our case does not exist) rather than the database specified via schema_editor.connection.alias (on line 15 of the same file) and thus fails loudly.
So, I believe that:
content_type.save(update_fields={'model'})
should be
content_type.save(using=db, update_fields={'model'})

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue, I need to inspect the source code of the `_rename` method in the `RenameContentType` class, located in the file `django/contrib/contenttypes/management/__init__.py`. This will allow me to understand the current implementation and verify if changes are necessary as suspected. 

Therefore, I'll proceed to retrieve the specific source code for this method. 

```python
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/contenttypes/management/__init__.py", "RenameContentType._rename")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_file("django/contrib/contenttypes/management/__init__.py", "RenameContentType._rename")
RESULT:
#### django/contrib/contenttypes/management/__init__.py:RenameContentType._rename
```python
    def _rename(self, apps, schema_editor, old_model, new_model):
        ContentType = apps.get_model('contenttypes', 'ContentType')
        db = schema_editor.connection.alias
        if not router.allow_migrate_model(db, ContentType):
            return

        try:
            content_type = ContentType.objects.db_manager(db).get_by_natural_key(self.app_label, old_model)
        except ContentType.DoesNotExist:
            pass
        else:
            content_type.model = new_model
            try:
                with transaction.atomic(using=db):
                    content_type.save(update_fields={'model'})
            except IntegrityError:
                # Gracefully fallback if a stale content type causes a
                # conflict as remove_stale_contenttypes will take care of
                # asking the user what should be done next.
                content_type.model = old_model
            else:
                # Clear the cache as the `get_by_natual_key()` call will cache
                # the renamed ContentType instance by its old model name.
                ContentType.objects.clear_cache()

```


==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

To resolve the issue, I need to examine the implementation of the `_sparse_fit` method in the `scikit-learn` codebase. Since it involves the internal method that is likely part of a SVM-related class, it is advisable to search specifically for the class and method.

I'll start by searching for the `_sparse_fit` method in the codebase to gather relevant information for generating the patch.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("_sparse_fit")
```

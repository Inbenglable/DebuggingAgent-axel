To resolve this issue, I need to access the source code of the Paginator class to implement the `__iter__` method. With the class's source code, I can make the necessary modifications. Since I haven't been provided with the file path where the Paginator class is defined, I will need to search for it in the project codebase. 

Let's proceed to search for the Paginator class within the Django codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Paginator")
```

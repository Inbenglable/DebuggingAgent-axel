To analyze the current issue, the error message indicates that settings are not configured properly before accessing the `INSTALLED_APPS`. The part of the test script responsible for this error appears in the initialization/setup phase where the settings should be configured for Django. Specifically, it lacks setting the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable, or the `settings.configure()` is called inappropriately, causing the failure before proper execution can start.

The ImproperlyConfigured exception arises because Django's environment isn't appropriately initialized, hence causing script execution failure when attempting an import that depends on these settings.

### At this point:
The root cause seems to lie in the improper setup before any attempt to interact with Django components requiring settings. This issue doesn't directly address the ManyToManyField permission problems but results in an unprepared state that halts execution prematurely.

### Decision:
To properly configure the settings, we need to ensure the Django setup is correctly handled before these accesses occur. However, since the problem currently is initialization-related, I need to trace further back to locate and verify where the configuration is meant to occur.

### Next Steps:
Since the settings must be appropriately set before any further interaction with Django apps, I'll trace to the section aimed at initializing these settings to confirm where these configuration guarantees should be respected within the context of the problem.

Proceed to observe deeper into how the setup is meant to occur safely:

I need to retrieve the source code for the main method responsible for reporting issues within the `linkcheck` module, specifically how it handles HTTP error scenarios during the link validation process. This will allow me to see where the problem with the error reporting lies and revise it accordingly to meet the expected behavior.

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py", "check")
```

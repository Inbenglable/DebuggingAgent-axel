To address the issue with the `strip_accents_unicode` function in the **scikit-learn** project, I need to inspect its current implementation and understand how it handles Unicode normalization and accent stripping. This will help us identify why it fails for strings that are already in NFKD form.

To proceed, I will search for the source code of the `strip_accents_unicode` function in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("strip_accents_unicode")
```

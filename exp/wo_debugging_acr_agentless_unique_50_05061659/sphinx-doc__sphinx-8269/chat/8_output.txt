To evaluate whether the issue is fixed, let's examine both the nature of the patch and the output of the test before and after the patch is applied.

### Patch Analysis

**Change Made in the Patch:**
- The patch makes a change to the `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py` file.
- It introduces a check for HTTP response status code right before processing the content of the response for an anchor. Specifically, if the `status_code` of the response is anything other than `200`, the method returns `False`, ensuring that HTTP errors are detected and reported correctly.

**Purpose of the Patch:**
- The bug, as described, occurs when linkcheck reports anchor-related errors when HTTP errors occur. The patch is designed to make sure that links returning HTTP error codes (such as 404 or 500) are correctly reported as such, rather than reporting a failure to find an anchor.

### Test Output Analysis

**Original Output:**
- The test failed due to a `FileNotFoundError`, indicating that the directory `/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/sphinx-doc__sphinx-8269/source/` did not exist. This is a configuration issue in the test setup, unrelated to the logic of the linkcheck feature.

**Patched Output:**
- The output remains the same as the original, with the same `FileNotFoundError`.

### Conclusion

From the test outputs before and after the patch, it is clear that the test itself never runs far enough to actually check the changes made by the patch. The `FileNotFoundError` prevents the test from reaching the part where it would evaluate the patch's logic related to HTTP error reporting.

Because the test setup does not even start executing the code that was patched, we cannot determine from these results alone whether the logic of the patch fixes the original issue.

### Resolution

Thus, based on the available information, the issue cannot be confirmed as resolved because the test never validates the linkcheck behavior due to unrelated setup errors.

Issue resolved: `False`

To address the issue with the `caplog` fixture not restoring the log level after a test finishes, we need to investigate the implementation of the `caplog` fixture. Our focus should be on understanding how the log level is set and how it is supposed to be restored. We will first need to locate and review the source code where the `caplog` fixture and its related functionalities are implemented.

Let's start by searching for the caplog fixture and its related methods in the pytest codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("caplog")
search_method_in_codebase("set_level")
search_method_in_codebase("restore_level")
search_method_in_codebase("handle")
search_method_in_codebase("teardown")
```

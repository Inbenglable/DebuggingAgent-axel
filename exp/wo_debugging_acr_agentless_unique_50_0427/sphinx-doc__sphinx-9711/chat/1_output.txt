To resolve this issue, I need to identify where the version checking for `needs_extensions` is implemented and understand how it currently processes the version strings. Since the issue seems to relate to how version strings are compared, I should look for a function or method responsible for this comparison mechanism.

Since I don't have the file path or method name, I will search for relevant code that might be involved in this process within the Sphinx codebase. I'll start with a known method search, if available, or if there's a keyword like "needs_extensions" as it might relate to the check. 

```python
search_method_in_codebase("needs_extensions")
```

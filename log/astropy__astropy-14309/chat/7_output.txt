The current analysis suggests that the `IndexError` arises due to a mismatch or incorrect handling of `args` parameters in the `identify_format` method, particularly when it invokes identifier functions from `self._identifiers`.

Given the error happens in `astropy/io/fits/connect.py` within the `is_fits` function, we need to make sure that it is handling its inputs correctly.

The problem likely lies in how the `is_fits` function is making assumptions about the contents of `args`. Since the traceback ends with:

```python
return isinstance(args[0], (HDUList, TableHDU, BinTableHDU, GroupsHDU))
```

There's an assumption that `args` contains at least one element, which does not hold true in this test case. 

To confirm and locate the buggy code, let's observe the context around how `is_fits` is defined and used, especially its handling of `args`.

Observed scope: `astropy/io/fits/connect.py:60-76`  
This will give us deeper insight into the registration or invocation logic within the affected scope.

I currently have the source code for the `ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute` method. However, the `FileInput` class does not have its own `use_required_attribute` implementation. Given that our goal is to move or modify the logic from `ClearableFileInput` to `FileInput`, I can now generate a patch to add the `use_required_attribute` method in `FileInput`. 

Ready generation: `True`

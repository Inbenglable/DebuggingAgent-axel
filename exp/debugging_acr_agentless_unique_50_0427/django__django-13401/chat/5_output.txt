To address the issue of fields being considered equal when they shouldn't be, we'll modify the `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods to include the model attribute in their comparisons.

Here are the patches to update these methods:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        # Needed for @total_ordering\n        if isinstance(other, Field):\n            return self.creation_counter == other.creation_counter\n        return NotImplemented\n=======\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        # Needed for @total_ordering\n        if isinstance(other, Field):\n            return (self.creation_counter == other.creation_counter and\n                    self.model == other.model)\n        return NotImplemented\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    def __hash__(self):\n        return hash(self.creation_counter)\n=======\n    def __hash__(self):\n        return hash((self.creation_counter, self.model))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    def __lt__(self, other):\n        # This is needed because bisect does not take a comparison function.\n        if isinstance(other, Field):\n            return self.creation_counter < other.creation_counter\n        return NotImplemented\n=======\n    def __lt__(self, other):\n        # This is needed because bisect does not take a comparison function.\n        if isinstance(other, Field):\n            if self.creation_counter != other.creation_counter:\n                return self.creation_counter < other.creation_counter\n            return self.model < other.model\n        return NotImplemented\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

These edits incorporate the `model` attribute into the equality, hashing, and comparison operations, thereby resolving the issue of fields from different models being incorrectly considered equal.

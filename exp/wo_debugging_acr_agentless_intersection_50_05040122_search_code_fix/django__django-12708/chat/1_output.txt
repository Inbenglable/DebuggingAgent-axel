To address this issue, we need to inspect the code responsible for handling index and unique constraints during migrations. Specifically, the error is occurring in the `_delete_composed_index()` method of the `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` file.

Before proceeding with generating the patch, I must first retrieve the source code of this method to understand how it operates and identify the necessary changes.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "_delete_composed_index")
```

To address the issue of rendering a 1-element tuple incorrectly, we need to delve into how the `unparse` function, located in `sphinx/pycode/ast.py`, is implemented. Since this function employs a visitor pattern through `_UnparseVisitor`, it's crucial to examine the visitor class to discern how it processes tuple nodes.

Let's retrieve the `_UnparseVisitor` class to inspect its implementation and make necessary adjustments to handle 1-element tuples. 

```python
search_class_in_file("sphinx/pycode/ast.py", "_UnparseVisitor")
```

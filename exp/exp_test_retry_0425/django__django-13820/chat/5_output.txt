To address the issue, I need to examine the implementation of the `load_disk` method within the `MigrationLoader` class found in `django/db/migrations/loader.py`. This will allow me to understand how the method currently checks for the `__file__` attribute and how it can be updated to handle packages without `__file__`. Since this information is crucial for generating the patch, I will retrieve the source code for the `MigrationLoader.load_disk` method.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/loader.py", "MigrationLoader.load_disk")
```

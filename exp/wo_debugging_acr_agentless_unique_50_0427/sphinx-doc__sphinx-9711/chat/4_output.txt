To resolve the issue of improper version comparison, I need to ensure that the `check_extension_version` function uses proper semantic versioning comparison instead of simple string comparison. This might involve utilizing a library like `packaging.version` for semantic version parsing and comparison.

To proceed, I will retrieve the source code of the `check_extension_version` function in the `reproduce.py` file, where it was identified. 

```python
search_method_in_file("reproduce.py", "check_extension_version")
```

Based on the issue description and the test output, the problem occurs when a structured numpy array is being added to an Astropy Table, and the array is automatically transformed into an `NdarrayMixin`. The test aims to detect this transformation, which is not desired anymore after specific updates in the project (#12644). 

The transformation seems to happen during the table column addition process. This automatic transformation affects how the structured array is handled, specifically its serialization, by signaling to unified I/O interfaces that it might not be supported directly.

From the trace output, it is visible that the problematic transformation happens during the execution of the `Table.__setitem__` method. This method internally calls `Table.add_column`, where the transformation takes place, as per the proposal in the issue description.

Let's confirm the transformation and pinpoint where the transformation occurs exactly:

Observed method: `astropy/table/table.py:add_column`

To address this issue, it is essential to comprehend how the `Avg` and `Sum` aggregate classes are structured in Django, particularly regarding their handling of the `DISTINCT` keyword. Therefore, I need to locate and examine these classes within the Django codebase to understand where modifications need to be made.

I'll start by searching for the `Avg` and `Sum` classes in the Django project codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Avg")
search_class_in_codebase("Sum")
```

To address the issue identified, we'll need to retrieve the source code of the `_query_cpu` method within the `pylint/lint/run.py` file. This will allow us to examine its logic and make the necessary modifications. Let's proceed with retrieving the source code for this specific method:

```python
search_method_in_file("pylint/lint/run.py", "_query_cpu")
```

The source code provided contains the `Subs` class definition, but does not include detailed implementation for its methods. The method responsible for LaTeX conversion is likely missing in the retrieved portion. Typically, SymPy handles LaTeX printing through a `_latex` or similar method, possibly in a separate printer module. Therefore, I need to search for this method in the codebase.

I will begin by searching for any LaTeX printing method associated with the `Subs` class, or if necessary, locate the module responsible for managing LaTeX conversions to investigate further.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("Subs._latex")
search_method_in_codebase("_latex")
search_code_in_codebase("latex")
```

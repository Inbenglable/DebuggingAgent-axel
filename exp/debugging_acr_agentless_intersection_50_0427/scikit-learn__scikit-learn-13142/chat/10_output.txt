Based on the traced runtime information and the analysis of the involved methods, it is clear that the issue stems from differences in parameter settings between `fit_predict` and `predict` when `n_init` is greater than 1 within the `GaussianMixture` class. The problem likely lies in how parameters are being set and retrieved.

The discrepancy between `fit_predict` and `predict` results when `n_init=5` indicates potential issues with how the optimal parameter set is chosen and stored. The `fit_predict` method is responsible for selecting the best parameter set but does not ensure that `predict` uses these same parameters due to possible mismanagement during setting and getting operations.

Given the tracing efforts, the `_set_parameters` method sets the parameters after choosing the best initializations. However, inconsistency is apparent between the way parameters are handled post-initialization and during subsequent predictions.

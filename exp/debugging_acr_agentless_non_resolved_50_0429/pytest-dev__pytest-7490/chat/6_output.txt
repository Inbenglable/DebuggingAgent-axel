Based on the runtime information and the code observations so far, the issue seems to be related to pytest's file path resolution and test discovery mechanism. The error message indicates that pytest is unable to locate the specified test `reproducer.py::test_xfail_test`. This suggests that pytest's test discovery might not be handling dynamic addition of markers correctly or there could be a regression between versions 5 and 6 related to path resolution.

The program attempts to execute a test using `pytest.main()` but reports a `UsageError` because the specified test is not found. It appears that the path to the test file is either not recognized or not processed correctly, leading to no tests being discovered or run.

To drill deeper into this path resolution and test discovery process, especially with respect to dynamic markers, I will observe the method in pytest responsible for collecting test paths after the configuration preparation (`_prepareconfig`). This could potentially explain why the test couldn't be located.

Let's trace the next part of the process to understand how test paths are interpreted and how pytest confirms the existence and validity of the test paths:

Observed method: `src/_pytest/main.py:collect`

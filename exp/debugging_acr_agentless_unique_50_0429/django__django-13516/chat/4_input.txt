Now You need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
flush() on self.stdout/stderr management commands doesn't work.
Description
	
flush() is notably called during migrate command; it doesn't work, and a long migration effectively prints to stderr no relevant information up until the end:
Operations to perform:
 Apply all migrations: myapp
Running migrations:
Then nothing more, but the migration is being done.
Then at the end of the real migration, the rest is flushed:
 Applying myapp.0002_auto_20200817_1030... OK
Expected behavior:
Operations to perform:
 Apply all migrations: myapp
Running migrations:
 Applying myapp.0002_auto_20200817_1030...
then work
then OK

</ISSUE>


A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
Analyzing the provided code and the abnormal behavior indicates that the issue arises due to incorrect usage or definition of the `captured_output` function.

The error message states:

```
TypeError: captured_output() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given
```

From the traceback, it's evident that the call:
```python
with captured_output('stdout', 'stderr') as (out, err):
```

is causing this error because it passes two arguments, `stdout` and `stderr`, to a function or context manager named `captured_output` which is defined to accept only one positional argument. 

The definition of `captured_output` is imported from `django.test.utils`. To locate the issue, we need to observe how `captured_output` is defined to understand what arguments it expects.

Thus, to trace the issue further, we should observe the method where `captured_output` is defined.

Observed method: `django/test/utils.py:captured_output`
==================================================
The error traceback suggests that the `captured_output` function is being called with two arguments (`'stdout'` and `'stderr'`), but it is defined to accept only one positional argument (`stream_name`). From the `captured_output` method in `django/test/utils.py`, we can see that it is designed to temporarily replace the system stream specified by `stream_name` with a `StringIO` object, allowing the capture of that specific stream's output.

Given that its design only supports a single stream at a time, the use of two arguments in the script causes the mismatch. The root of the issue is in how the `captured_output` is invoked within the script.

Let's now locate the buggy portion of the test script provided, focusing on the incorrect call to the `captured_output` function:

```python
# Line in the test script causing the issue
with captured_output('stdout', 'stderr') as (out, err):
```

To capture both `stdout` and `stderr` using `captured_output`, the code should likely use two separate `with` statements, one for each stream.

Buggy method: `reproduce.py:handle`
==================================================


Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

The issue appears to involve the `formats` argument not being applied when writing HTML tables. Given that we found an `HTML` class in `astropy/io/ascii/html.py` and the `write()` method in the `HTML` class is where HTML formatting would happen, we should investigate the implementation of that `write` method to understand how it handles formats.

To proceed with generating a patch, I will need to access the full source code of the `HTML` class and its `write` method to ensure that the `formats` argument is correctly utilized during the writing process.

```python
search_class_in_file("astropy/io/ascii/html.py", "HTML")
search_method_in_file("astropy/io/ascii/html.py", "HTML.write")
```

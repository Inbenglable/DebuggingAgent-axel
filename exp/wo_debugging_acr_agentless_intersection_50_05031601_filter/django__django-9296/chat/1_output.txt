To implement the `__iter__` function for the Paginator class, I need to review the current implementation of the Paginator class and check its existing methods, notably the `page_range` and `page` methods, to understand how pages are retrieved and iterated over.

Firstly, I need to find the Paginator class source code to understand the existing implementation. If it's not immediately clear where the Paginator class is located, I might need to search for its code in the project's codebase.

Let's start by identifying its location and retrieving the necessary code.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Paginator")
search_method_in_codebase("page_range")
search_method_in_codebase("page")
```

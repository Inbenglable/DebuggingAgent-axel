To resolve the issue, I need to locate the part of the code in `xarray/core/merge.py` where `combine_attrs` is being handled. The user mentioned a specific line to check, so I will search that code snippet surrounding the specified line.

```python
search_code_in_file("xarray/core/merge.py", "return variable_attrs[0]")
```

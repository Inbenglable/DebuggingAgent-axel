Based on the traceback and the retrieved code, the error originates from the fact that `surds` might be an empty list in `split_surds`, which leads to attempting to access `a[0]` in `_split_gcd` causing an `IndexError`. To resolve this issue, we can add a conditional check in `_split_gcd` to handle the case where no integers are provided, returning a default value or simply returning `0, [], []`.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/simplify/radsimp.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    g = a[0]\n=======\n    if not a:\n        return 0, [], []\n    g = a[0]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
``` 

The proposed fix adds a simple check for an empty list at the beginning of `_split_gcd`, ensuring that if `a` is empty, it returns `0` for `g` and empty lists for `a1` and `a2`, which will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.

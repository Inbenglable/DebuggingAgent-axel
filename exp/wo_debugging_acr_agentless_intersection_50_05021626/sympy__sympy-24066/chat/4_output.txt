It appears that I've already retrieved the source code for the method `UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension`, which I need to modify. After reviewing the code and the details of the issue, I believe I am ready to generate the patch. The problem is within the handling of `Function` expressions, where dimensionless arguments should yield a dimensionless result, but it currently does not handle this adequately. Additionally, the logic for `Pow` expressions is where I need to confirm that dimensionless exponents set dimension as `Dimension(1)` instead of merely `1`.

I don't currently need additional code retrievalâ€”everything necessary to craft a solution is already visible:

- The method `UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension` already exists with handling for `Pow` and `Function` that needs tweaking.
- The helper method `DimensionSystem.is_dimensionless` ensures that a dimension with no dimensional dependencies is treated as dimensionless.
- `SI.get_dimension_system()` already correctly provides the dimension system object.

Therefore, I'm ready to create a patch correcting these issues.

Ready generation: `True`

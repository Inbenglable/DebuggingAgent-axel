To fix the issue, I will modify the `_query_cpu` function to ensure it returns a minimum of one CPU, thus avoiding crashing when Pylint is run with parallel jobs and the calculated number of CPUs is zero. Here's the patch:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### pylint/lint/run.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    return avail_cpu\n=======\n    return max(avail_cpu, 1)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

Based on the analysis of the `captured_output` method and the error traceback, it is clear that the method only accepts a single argument, which is the stream name (`stdout` or `stderr`). However, the test script is incorrectly providing two arguments (`'stdout', 'stderr'`), which is causing the `TypeError`.

To resolve this issue, the script should be modified to capture each output stream separately. The context manager `captured_output` should be called once for capturing `stdout` and once for capturing `stderr`.

Given this understanding, we can locate the buggy code directly without further tracing, as this is a straightforward API usage error.

Buggy method: `test_script.py:handle` (in the user's script)

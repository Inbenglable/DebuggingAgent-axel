You are a PR reviewer that needs to review the patch generated by a bug repair agent and determine whether the issue is fixed or not.
This is the bug issue, which is in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Paginator just implement the __iter__ function
Description
	 
		(last modified by Alex Gaynor)
	 
Right now, when you want to iter into all the pages of a Paginator object you to use the page_range function. It would be more logical and naturel to use the normal python of doing that by implementing the iter function like that:
def __iter__(self):
	for page_num in self.page_range:
		yield self.page(page_num)

</ISSUE>


Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
## REPRODUCE TEST
```
import traceback
import sys
from django.core.paginator import Paginator

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__):
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Mimicking a Paginator class without the __iter__ method
class MockPaginator(Paginator):
    def __init__(self, object_list, per_page, orphans=0, allow_empty_first_page=True):
        super().__init__(object_list, per_page, orphans, allow_empty_first_page)

    # Intentionally not defining __iter__ here to reproduce the issue

def main():
    # Sample data
    data = list(range(1, 101))  # 100 items
    paginator = MockPaginator(data, 10)  # 10 items per page

    try:
        # Attempt to iterate over the paginator
        for page in paginator:
            print(page.object_list)
        # If we reach here, it means __iter__ is implemented, which is not expected for the issue
        print("The issue is fixed.")
    except AttributeError as e:
        # If AttributeError is raised, it means __iter__ is not implemented, which is expected for the issue
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Paginator does not implement __iter__ method.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

And this is the original output when running the test (before applying the patch):
## ORIGINAL OUTPUT
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-9296/reproduce.py", line 38, in <module>
    main()
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-9296/reproduce.py", line 28, in main
    for page in paginator:
TypeError: 'MockPaginator' object is not iterable

```

The repair agent has tried to generate a patch to fix the issue:
## PATCH CONTEXT
<PATCH_CONTEXT>
To address the issue of making the `Paginator` class iterable, I'll add the `__iter__` method with the proposed implementation. This addition will not disrupt the existing functionality and will provide iteration capability.

Here's the patch in *SEARCH/REPLACE* format:

```python
### django/core/paginator.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def _check_object_list_is_ordered(self):
=======
    def __iter__(self):
        for page_num in self.page_range:
            yield self.page(page_num)

    def _check_object_list_is_ordered(self):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, I'll provide this update in JSON format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/core/paginator.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    def _check_object_list_is_ordered(self):\n=======\n    def __iter__(self):\n        for page_num in self.page_range:\n            yield self.page(page_num)\n\n    def _check_object_list_is_ordered(self):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
``` 

This patch introduces the `__iter__` method, allowing instances of `Paginator` to be directly iterable using a for loop, effectively solving the issue.

After applying the patch, the output of the test is:

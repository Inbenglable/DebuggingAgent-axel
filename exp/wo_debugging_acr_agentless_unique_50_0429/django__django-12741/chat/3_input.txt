You are a bug repair agent to resolve issues and submit pull requests.
Now You need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Simplify signature of `DatabaseOperations.execute_sql_flush()`
Description
	
The current signature is:
def execute_sql_flush(self, using, sql_list):
The using argument can be dropped and inferred by the calling instance: self.connection.alias.
def execute_sql_flush(self, sql_list):
Some internal ises of this method are already doing:
connection.ops.execute_sql_flush(connection.alias, sql_flush)

</ISSUE>


You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
I need to retrieve the source code of the `execute_sql_flush` method to make the necessary changes. Initially, I don't have the file path, so I must search the method in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("execute_sql_flush")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("execute_sql_flush")
RESULT:
#### django/db/backends/base/operations.py:BaseDatabaseOperations.execute_sql_flush
```python
    def execute_sql_flush(self, using, sql_list):
        """Execute a list of SQL statements to flush the database."""
        with transaction.atomic(using=using, savepoint=self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl):
            with self.connection.cursor() as cursor:
                for sql in sql_list:
                    cursor.execute(sql)

```


==================================================

Your Output:
Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

To address the issue of setting the default `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION` to `0o644`, we need to modify the Django settings to set this as the default value if none is explicitly provided. This involves updating the `global_settings.py` to reflect this default value and ensuring that the documentation and test cases align with this new default.

Here's how the changes should be applied in the codebase:

1. **Update the default setting in `global_settings.py`:**
   We need to set `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` to `0o644` in the `django/conf/global_settings.py` file.

2. **Ensure that the `_save` method in `FileSystemStorage` respects this default:**
   The existing logic already respects the `settings.FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting when `file_permissions_mode` is applied. Thus no change is required in the `storage.py` file for this logic.

Here are the patches for these changes:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/conf/global_settings.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nFILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None\n=======\nFILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = 0o644\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This change sets the `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` default to `0o644`, ensuring that in absence of an explicit configuration, uploaded files have consistent permissions across different deployments and storage behaviors.

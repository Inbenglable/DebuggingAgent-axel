To determine whether the issue is resolved, let's analyze the patch and the test outputs before and after the patch.

### Patch Analysis
The patch attempts to fix the issue by adding the `allow_distinct = True` attribute to the `Avg` and `Sum` classes in `django/db/models/aggregates.py`. This change should enable the DISTINCT keyword for these aggregate functions, allowing them to support distinct aggregation, as intended.

### Test Output Analysis

#### Original Output
The original output indicates an `AppRegistryNotReady` exception, which is unrelated to the DISTINCT parameter support for aggregates. This exception is due to issues with Django app configuration and initialization in the test setup.

#### Patched Output
The patched output shows the same `AppRegistryNotReady` exception. This indicates that the test setup is still encountering issues with Django's app registry, preventing the tests from executing as intended. Consequently, we cannot ascertain from this output whether the DISTINCT support change in the `Avg` and `Sum` classes has successfully addressed the original issue.

### Conclusion
Given that the same exception occurred before and after the patch and is related to test setup rather than the DISTINCT support, we cannot confirm if the underlying issue was resolved without first fixing the test setup. As it stands, the test cannot run properly to verify the fix due to unrelated configuration/setup problems.

Issue resolved: `False`

The patch provided does not address the core issue described in the reproducible test's original output. The main error before applying the patch is an `AttributeError`, which indicates that the "migrations" module does not have an attribute `OneToOneField`. This error is not directly related to the operational error caused by adding a `UNIQUE` column in SQLite, which was initially described in the issue.

The patch context provided focuses on modifying the handling of `UNIQUE` constraints within the `_remake_table` method in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py`, which would potentially address the operational error described in the issue but does not address the AttributeError seen in the reproducible test.

After applying the patch, the output remains the same with the same `AttributeError`, which means the patch did not resolve the error encountered during the test. The unchanged error output suggests that the issue was not addressed by this patch. The AttributeError needs to be corrected by ensuring `OneToOneField` is correctly imported or used from the appropriate Django module (likely `models`).

Given this analysis:

Issue resolved: `False`

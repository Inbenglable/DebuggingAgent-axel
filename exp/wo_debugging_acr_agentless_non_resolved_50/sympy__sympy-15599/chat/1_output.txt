To resolve the issue, I need to analyze the existing implementation of the `doit` method within the `sympy/core/mod.py` file, as well as potential related classes or methods in the sympy project. This is to ensure a proper modification that results in the correct handling of `Mod(3*i, 2)` to simplify it to `Mod(i, 2)`.

Thus, I'll explore the relevant parts of the codebase by searching for specific methods and the code mentioned in the provided diff, following the issue details:

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/core/mod.py", "doit")
search_code_in_file("sympy/core/tests/test_arit.py", "def test_Mod():")
```

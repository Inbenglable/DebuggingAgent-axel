To determine if the issue is resolved, let's analyze the given elements:

### Patch Analysis
The patch modifies the behavior in `sympy/polys/polytools.py` concerning how `Piecewise` expressions are handled. The original code raises a `PolynomialError` when encountering a `Piecewise` object, indicating that Piecewise generators are problematic in that context. The patch changes this logic to bypass the polynomial interpretation for `Piecewise` expressions by using a `continue` statement, thus preventing the error from being raised.

### Test Output Before Patch
Before applying the patch, the test output clearly shows that a `PolynomialError` is raised when trying to substitute the value in an expression involving `Piecewise`, which confirms the presence of the issue described.

### Test Output After Patch
After applying the patch, the test outputs "The issue is fixed." and does not raise the `PolynomialError`. This indicates that the test, which is designed to fail by raising an exception if the issue persists, now passes without triggering any errors.

### Conclusion
The patch effectively prevents the `PolynomialError` from being raised by bypassing the polynomial generator logic for `Piecewise` expressions. The test verifies this fix by executing the same substitution process that previously caused an error, and it completes successfully without errors.

Issue resolved: `True`

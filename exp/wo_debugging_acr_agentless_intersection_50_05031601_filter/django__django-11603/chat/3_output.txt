To resolve the issue of adding `DISTINCT` support for `Avg` and `Sum` aggregates, I may need to check if there is existing handling or any methods related to parameters processing that need alteration to facilitate the handling of `DISTINCT`. 

Therefore, I'll search for any methods within the `Aggregate` class that may relate to parameter handling, as both `Avg` and `Sum` inherit from it.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Aggregate")
```

Analyzing the observed behavior, the test case highlights an issue with the `_query_cpu()` function returning 0, which subsequently causes a crash due to multiprocessing requiring a number greater than 0 for processes. The abnormal behavior stems from casting the result of CPU calculation to an integer, resulting in 0 when it should be at least 1.

Given the context, the calculation involved in `_query_cpu()` seems to be the root cause of the issue.

Buggy method: `pylint/lint/run.py:_query_cpu`

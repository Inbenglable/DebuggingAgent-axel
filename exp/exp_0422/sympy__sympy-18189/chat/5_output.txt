To resolve the issue in the `diophantine` method discussed, I need to retrieve the source code of this method from the `sympy/solvers/diophantine.py` file to explore the permutation logic and identify the exact cause of the discrepancy.

I'll proceed to retrieve the code using the following API:

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/solvers/diophantine.py", "diophantine")
```

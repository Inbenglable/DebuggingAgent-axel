Analyzing the runtime information and code snippet from `_parse_command_line_configuration`, we see that each action in `self._actions` is processed within `self._arg_parser.parse_known_args`. Among the actions, `_DoNothingAction` with options `['--verbose', '-v']` expects arguments, which is problematic for the short `-v` option.

Tracing this behavior further, it indicates that when the options are registered with the argument parser, the short `-v` option was mistakenly set to expect an argument. To resolve this, we need to locate where the `verbose` option with `option_strings=['--verbose', '-v']` is defined in the argument parsing setup, likely within the initialization or setup method of the argument manager.

Based on this deduction, it's prudent to trace where argument configurations are set initially, which generally occurs in a constructor or a dedicated option setup method.

Observed method: `pylint/config/arguments_manager.py:_register_options`

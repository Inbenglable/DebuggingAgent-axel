To address the issue described, I need to understand how the `units.quantity_input` decorator works, particularly how it handles the return value type hints. The traceback indicates an error in the `decorators.py` and `units/decorators.py` files.

I'll search for the relevant method related to the `units.quantity_input` decorator to see how it processes return annotations and handle possible issues with `NoneType`.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/units/decorators.py", "wrapper")
search_code_in_file("astropy/units/decorators.py", "quantity_input")
search_code_in_file("astropy/utils/decorators.py", "__init__")
```

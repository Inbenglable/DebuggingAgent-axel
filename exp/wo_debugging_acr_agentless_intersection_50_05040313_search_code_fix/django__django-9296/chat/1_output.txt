To resolve the issue, we need to locate the `Paginator` class within the Django project and examine its existing methods. Particularly, we need to identify where the `page_range` function is defined and how we can integrate the `__iter__` method into the `Paginator` class.

To do this, I need to retrieve the source code for the `Paginator` class. Since the file path is not specified, I will first search for the `Paginator` class in the project's codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Paginator")
```

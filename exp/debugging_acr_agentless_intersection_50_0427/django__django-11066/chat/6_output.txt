To determine whether the issue is resolved, let's analyze the patch and the test outputs:

### Patch Analysis:

The patch modifies the `content_type.save(update_fields={'model'})` line to `content_type.save(using=db, update_fields={'model'})`. This change aligns with the description in the issue, which suggests that the `save` method should specify the `using=db` parameter to ensure the operation is performed on the correct database.

### Test Output Analysis:

#### Original Output:
The original output shows an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception due to the environment variable `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` not being set. This error is unrelated to the issue and indicates a misconfiguration in the test setup itself.

#### Patched Output:
The patched output is identical to the original output, showing the same `ImproperlyConfigured` exception.

### Conclusion:

The underlying issue described in the bug report cannot be verified as resolved because the test setup does not properly configure the Django settings, resulting in an `ImproperlyConfigured` error unrelated to the database routing issue. The error must be addressed in the test setup for the test to execute correctly to verify if the patch effectively resolves the database usage issue.

**Issue resolved: `False`**

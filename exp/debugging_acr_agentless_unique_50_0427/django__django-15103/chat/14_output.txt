### Analysis of Current Observed Code

The observed code snippet primarily deals with Django template parsing related to the `{% ifchanged %}` template tag, which is not directly related to the `json_script`. This part focuses on parsing tokens to create decision-based outputs in Django templates. It uses the `parser`, which handles how these tokens are interpreted and processed.

### Abnormal Program Behavior

The recurring issue remains that the `json_script` is not found, which likely means it isn't defined or registered correctly in Django's template system. The `load_from_library` function is about checking tags and filters within a library, and since `json_script` isn't found, either:

- `json_script` itself is not defined.
- The registration process for `json_script` is missing or incorrect.

The `AssertionError` noted in the runtime information relates to an internal issue within the debugging environment, specifically an assertion check for file path existence, and is unrelated to the Django functionality issue.

### Next Steps

The current focus on `ifchanged` doesn't directly relate to the `json_script` issue, suggesting we need to trace how template tags are registered within Django to pinpoint why `json_script` is not found.

Next, we will need to inspect parts of the codebase where template tags are registered and initialized to see where `json_script` should be defined or registered. This should help in understanding the registration process and identifying any missing pieces or incorrect definitions related to `json_script`.

The patch attempted to add `get_antialiased` and `set_antialiased` methods to the `Text` class in `lib/matplotlib/text.py` and modify the `RendererAgg.draw_text` method in `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_agg.py`. However, it introduced an error because the `get_antialiased` method tries to access `rcParams` without importing it.

### Analysis:

1. **Original Test Output:** The error was due to the absence of the `set_antialiased` method in the `Text` class: 
   ```
   AttributeError: 'Text' object has no attribute 'set_antialiased'
   ```

2. **Patched Test Output:** After the patch, a new error arises:
   ```
   NameError: name 'rcParams' is not defined
   ```
   This error indicates that the `rcParams` variable is referenced in the `get_antialiased` method without import or definition within the scope.

### Conclusion:

The patch did not resolve the issue because it introduced a new error by failing to import or define `rcParams` within the context of `get_antialiased`. This oversight prevents the method from retrieving the default antialiasing value as intended.

To fix this, `rcParams` must be correctly imported or defined in `lib/matplotlib/text.py` to be accessible by the `get_antialiased` method. Once corrected, the functionality should be retested.

**Issue resolved:** `False`

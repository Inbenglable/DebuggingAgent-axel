To resolve the issue, I need to locate and inspect the relevant code in the `astropy` project related to the `units.quantity_input` decorator function. Specifically, I want to examine how the return type is checked and handled.

First, I need to find the source code for the `decorators.py` file where the error occurred. I will search for the relevant methods within this file since the error message specifically mentions `astropy.utils.decorators.py`.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/utils/decorators.py", "make_function_with_signature")
search_method_in_file("astropy/units/decorators.py", "wrapper")
```

These methods were explicitly mentioned in the error traceback, and examining them should provide insight into how the return type is processed, especially when it's `None`. Once I have the source code for these methods, I'll be ready to generate the patch.

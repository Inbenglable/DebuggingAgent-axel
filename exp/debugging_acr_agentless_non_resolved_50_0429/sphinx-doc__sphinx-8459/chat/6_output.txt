To address the issue, I need to examine further code related to `autodoc_type_aliases` and how type hints are transformed when `autodoc_typehints` is set to "description". The `format_signature` method alone does not provide enough context about how type aliases are applied or modified. I need to understand how type hints are processed by the autodoc system within Sphinx.

Therefore, it would be helpful to see the implementation details about the handling of `autodoc_type_aliases`. This likely happens in a related method or in the configuration-handling code of the Sphinx autodoc extension.

To proceed, I will need to examine how Sphinx generally retrieves and applies type alias transformations within its autodoc module. 

```python
search_code_in_file("sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py", "autodoc_type_aliases")
```

This will help locate the specific part of the code where `autodoc_type_aliases` is handled, which is essential for generating a correct patch.

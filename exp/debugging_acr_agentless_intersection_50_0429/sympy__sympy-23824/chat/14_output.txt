The bug in the `kahane_simplify` function was caused by the reversal of leading uncontracted gamma matrices. Initially, when the test was run, the output demonstrated this reversal issue: 

- **Original Output**: 
  ``` 
  4*GammaMatrix(rho)*GammaMatrix(sigma) 
  4*GammaMatrix(sigma)*GammaMatrix(rho) 
  AssertionError
  ```

The test failure indicates that the order of gamma matrices `rho` and `sigma` was reversed in the second case.

The proposed patch modifies the loop in the code to prevent reversing the order by ensuring the leading matrices are inserted correctly. The adjustment is to iterate in reversed order:

```python
for i in reversed(range(0, first_dum_pos)):
    [ri.insert(0, free_pos[i]) for ri in resulting_indices]
```

This change addresses the bug by maintaining the order of gamma matrices when they are added back in during simplification.

- **Patched Output**:
  ```
  4*GammaMatrix(rho)*GammaMatrix(sigma)
  4*GammaMatrix(rho)*GammaMatrix(sigma)
  ```

Here, after applying the patch, the test outputs are consistent and correct, showing that both expressions simplify to the expected form without reversing the order of `rho` and `sigma`.

Reviewing the patch and comparing the output before and after applying the patch clearly indicates that the issue has been resolved.

Issue resolved: `True`

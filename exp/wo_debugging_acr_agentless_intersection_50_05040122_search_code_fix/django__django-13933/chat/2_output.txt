To resolve the issue, I need to find where the `ValidationError` is being raised in the `ModelChoiceField` class, particularly focusing on the `validate` method, as this is likely where the error occurs. I'll retrieve the source code for this specific method from the `django/forms/models.py` file to understand how the error message can be modified to include the invalid choice value.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/forms/models.py", "ModelChoiceField.validate")
```

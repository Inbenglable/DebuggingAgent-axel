You are a PR reviewer that needs to review the patch generated by a bug repair agent and determine whether the issue is fixed or not.
This is the bug issue, which is in the **sympy** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
`Permutation` constructor fails with non-disjoint cycles
Calling `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` raises a `ValueError` instead of constructing the identity permutation.  If the cycles passed in are non-disjoint, they should be applied in left-to-right order and the resulting permutation should be returned.

This should be easy to compute.  I don't see a reason why non-disjoint cycles should be forbidden.

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
## REPRODUCE TEST
```
import sys
from sympy.combinatorics.permutations import Permutation

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        # Attempt to create a Permutation with non-disjoint cycles
        p = Permutation([[0, 1], [0, 1]])
        # If no exception is raised, check if the permutation is the identity
        assert p == Permutation([0, 1]), "The permutation should be the identity permutation."
    except ValueError as e:
        # Print the stack trace and raise an AssertionError
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Permutation constructor raised ValueError for non-disjoint cycles instead of constructing the identity permutation.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

And this is the original output when running the test (before applying the patch):

```

The repair agent has tried to generate a patch to fix the issue:
## PATCH CONTEXT
<PATCH_CONTEXT>
To resolve the issue with handling non-disjoint cycles for the `Permutation` constructor in the `sympy` project, I'll make changes to the `__new__` method in the `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` file. The goal is to allow non-disjoint cycles and apply them sequentially from left to right to compute the resultant permutation rather than raising a `ValueError` when duplicates are detected. Here's the planned patch:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if has_dups(temp):\n            if is_cycle:\n                raise ValueError('there were repeated elements; to resolve '\n                'cycles use Cycle%s.' % ''.join([str(tuple(c)) for c in args]))\n            else:\n                raise ValueError('there were repeated elements.')\n        temp = set(temp)\n\n=======\n        temp = set(temp)\n        if not is_cycle and \\\n                any(i not in temp for i in range(len(temp))):\n            raise ValueError(\"Integers 0 through %s must be present.\" %\n                             max(temp))\n\n        if is_cycle:\n            c = Cycle()\n            for ci in args:\n                c = c(*ci)\n            aform = c.list()\n        else:\n            aform = list(args)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

Explanation of the changes:
- Removed the section of code where `ValueError` was being raised if duplicate elements were found in non-disjoint cycles when `is_cycle` was `True`.
- Implemented logic to sequentially apply the non-disjoint cycles from left to right using the provided cycle notation, ultimately computing the resultant permutation.

After applying the patch, the output of the test is:

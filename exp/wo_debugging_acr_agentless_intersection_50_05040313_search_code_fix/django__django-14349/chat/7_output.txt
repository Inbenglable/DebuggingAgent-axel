The issue is not resolved according to the information provided. 

Review of the patch:
1. The patch's intent was to address the changes introduced by `bpo-43882` by stripping newline (`\n`), carriage return (`\r`), and tab (`\t`) characters from the input URL before proceeding with validation.
2. The actual change proposed in the patch (`value = value.strip('\\n\\r\\t')`) is aimed at removing these characters from both ends of the URL string. However, typically these characters can appear within the string as well.

Analysis of test output:
1. The original output shows failures because `ValidationError` was not raised when URLs with line feed (`\n`) characters were passed for validation.
2. The patched output still shows the same failures. The errors indicate that after applying the patch, `ValidationError` was still not raised for these URLs, meaning the patch didn't cause the validation to function as expected.

Examining this entire scenario, it appears the reason for failure in both cases (before and after the patch) lies in the fact that the `ValidationError` was not raised due to the way the function processes the input URLs. Even after stripping, the line feed characters present within the URLs (not just at the ends) should be causing the validation to fail.

Therefore, the patch did not address the core issue identified in the test. The test results are unchanged, indicating the problem still exists.

Issue resolved: `False`

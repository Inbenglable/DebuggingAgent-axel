To address the issue with the `autodoc` in Sphinx where an empty `__all__` attribute is ignored, I need to identify the part of the code responsible for handling the `__all__` attribute. This will help me understand where the check for the empty `__all__` attribute needs to be implemented. The `sphinx.ext.autodoc` extension is involved in this process, so I will begin by searching for methods related to `autodoc` that involve handling `__all__`.

I will search for potentially relevant methods in the codebase that might be responsible for processing the `__all__` attribute.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("get_members")
search_method_in_codebase("filter_members")
```

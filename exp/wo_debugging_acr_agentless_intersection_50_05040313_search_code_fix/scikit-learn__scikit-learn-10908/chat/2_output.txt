To address the issue, we need to focus specifically on the `get_feature_names` method that belongs to the `CountVectorizer` class, since the problem is directly related to this class. 

Let's analyze the API results:

1. **sklearn/pipeline.py:FeatureUnion.get_feature_names**: This method is part of the `FeatureUnion` class and handles feature names for all transformers. It's not related to `CountVectorizer`.

2. **sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py:CountVectorizer.get_feature_names**: This method belongs to the `CountVectorizer` class and matches the context of the issue. It is relevant for our problem.

3. **sklearn/feature_extraction/dict_vectorizer.py:DictVectorizer.get_feature_names**: This method is part of the `DictVectorizer` class, which is another vectorizer type and not related to `CountVectorizer`.

4. **sklearn/preprocessing/data.py:PolynomialFeatures.get_feature_names**: This method is part of the `PolynomialFeatures` class and deals with polynomial featuresâ€”unrelated to the `CountVectorizer`.

Based on this analysis, the relevant implementation is:

```
sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py:CountVectorizer.get_feature_names
```

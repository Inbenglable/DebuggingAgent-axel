To address the issue with the `timesince()` function, I will adjust the creation of the `pivot` datetime object to account for the timezone information, which currently is causing the `TypeError` when `USE_TZ=True`.

Here's the patch to resolve this:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/utils/timesince.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            d.hour,\n            d.minute,\n            d.second,\n        )\n=======\n            d.hour,\n            d.minute,\n            d.second,\n            tzinfo=d.tzinfo,\n        )\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This update ensures that when creating the `pivot` datetime, it retains the timezone information from the original datetime `d`, avoiding the discrepancy between naive and aware datetime objects, and thus fixing the issue.

To resolve the issue with the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass, I need to examine the implementation of its `__init__` method, since this is where the modification would potentially need to be made to accommodate properties.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/utils/misc.py", "InheritDocstrings.__init__")
```

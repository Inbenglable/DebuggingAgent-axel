Based on the runtime information, the problem occurs during the execution of the `Table.add_column` method in the Astropy library. This method is responsible for adding a column to a table. The specific issue is that when a structured numpy array is added to a table, it is automatically transformed into an `NdarrayMixin`, which is not desired based on the recent updates in the project.

The transformation seems to occur at this line:

```python
col = self._convert_data_to_col(col, name=name, copy=copy, default_name=default_name)
```

Upon returning from the `_convert_data_to_col` method, the `col` has become an `NdarrayMixin`. This indicates that the automatic transformation logic is happening within the `_convert_data_to_col` method.

To further investigate, we need to examine the implementation of the `_convert_data_to_col` method to understand which part of it is responsible for the transformation.

Observed scope: `astropy/table/table.py:2174-2175`

To resolve the issue of checking local links in Sphinx's `linkcheck`, it's necessary to locate and modify the part of the codebase where link checking is performed. We'll need to understand where and how links are currently being checked. Thus, we should start by searching for the relevant method that is responsible for link checking in the Sphinx project.

Let's proceed by searching for the likely link-checking method in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("linkcheck")
```

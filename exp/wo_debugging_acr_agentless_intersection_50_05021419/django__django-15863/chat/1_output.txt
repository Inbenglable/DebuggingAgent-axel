Based on the issue description, the problem is with the `floatformat` template filter, which incorrectly converts Decimal numbers to float, causing loss of precision. 

To resolve the issue, I need to review the code implementation of the `floatformat` function. I will search for this function in the Django codebase to gather the necessary source code and understand how the current implementation converts Decimal numbers.

Since the file path is not provided, I'll first search for the method `floatformat` in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("floatformat")
```

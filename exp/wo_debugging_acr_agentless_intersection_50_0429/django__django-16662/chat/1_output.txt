To resolve the issue of import sorting in Django migration files, I need to investigate how Django generates the migration files, specifically focusing on the code that handles import statements. Typically, this function might reside in the migration-related modules.

I'll start by searching for methods related to migration file generation in the codebase, which is likely part of the Django library that facilitates automatic migration file creation. This might involve looking into methods that deal with the creation or writing of migration files.

I'll start by searching for relevant methods in the migration codebase:

```python
search_method_in_codebase("generate_migration_file")
search_method_in_codebase("write_migration_file")
search_method_in_codebase("render_migration")
```

This search will help me locate where import statements are handled, and subsequently apply the correct ordering strategy as per Djangoâ€™s coding style guidelines.

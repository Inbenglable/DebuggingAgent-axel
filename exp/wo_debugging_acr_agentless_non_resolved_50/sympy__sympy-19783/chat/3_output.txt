To address this issue, I need to examine how the `__mul__` method is implemented in the `IdentityOperator` class. Understanding this implementation will help determine why `Dagger` and `IdentityOperator` are not simplifying correctly and how to implement a fix.

I will retrieve the source code for the `__mul__` method in the `IdentityOperator` class to create a patch.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/physics/quantum/operator.py", "IdentityOperator.__mul__")
```

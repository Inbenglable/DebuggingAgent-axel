The test provided checks if Sphinx's `linkcheck` can now verify local (internal) links and flag them as broken if they do not exist. 

### Analysis of the Patch:
The patch attempts to modify the `check_thread` function in the `linkcheck` builder to check if internal links point to existing documents. It retrieves the current document's name with `self.app.env.docname` and checks if the local URI is present in `self.app.env.found_docs`.

### Review of Test Outputs:

- **Original Output:** The issue mentioned in the test (`doesntexist` local link) is marked as `-local-` in the output, meaning that it has not been checked correctly. It logs the link as local but doesn't return a descriptive status.

- **Patched Output:** After applying the patch, the output generates a `KeyError` on `'docname'`. This means the `patch` is attempting to access a non-existent or improperly structured part of the Sphinx environment, resulting in a failure. Therefore, the issue is not only unresolved, but it introduced a new error.

Given the `KeyError`, the patch does not successfully fix the issue, as the test breaks instead of verifying the desired functionality (checking and appropriately reporting the status of local links).

### Conclusion:

The issue is not resolved by the patch since it failed to implement a working internal link-check and led to an error during execution.

Issue resolved: `False`

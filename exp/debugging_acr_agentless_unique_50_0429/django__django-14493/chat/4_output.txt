To resolve the `UnboundLocalError` issue, I need to review the source code of the `post_process` method in the `ManifestFilesMixin` class, as this is where the error occurs due to the uninitialized `substitutions` variable. Since I have identified the specific class and method from the `django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py` file, I will proceed to retrieve the source code for the `post_process` method in the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py", "ManifestFilesMixin.post_process")
```

To resolve this issue, I need to examine the code related to the `GaussianMixture` class and its methods `fit_predict` and `predict`. I will search for these methods, potentially within the `mixture` module where `GaussianMixture` is typically located in the scikit-learn library.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("GaussianMixture")
search_method_in_codebase("GaussianMixture.fit_predict")
search_method_in_codebase("GaussianMixture.predict")
```

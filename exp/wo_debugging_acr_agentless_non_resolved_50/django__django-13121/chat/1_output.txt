To address the issue at hand, we need to analyze the source code related to duration field conversions and expressions handling in Django. The traceback suggests that there's an issue in the `convert_durationfield_value` method located in `django/db/backends/base/operations.py`. Furthermore, understanding the underlying logic for `apply_converters` in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` will be beneficial. Additionally, examining the duration field expression handling code might also help. Thus, I will need to retrieve source code for these components.

Given the steps required, here's the approach to retrieve the necessary source code:

1. Explore the `convert_durationfield_value` method in `django/db/backends/base/operations.py`.
2. Check for how duration expressions are handled and compiled, particularly in relation to the `apply_converters` method in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`.
3. Reference the `DurationField` to cover its conversion aspects, if needed.

Therefore, I need to retrieve the code for the relevant methods and classes using the search APIs.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/base/operations.py", "convert_durationfield_value")
search_method_in_codebase("apply_converters")
search_class_in_codebase("DurationField")
```

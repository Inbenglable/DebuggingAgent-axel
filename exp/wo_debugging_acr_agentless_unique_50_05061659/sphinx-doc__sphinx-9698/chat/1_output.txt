To resolve this issue, we need to identify how Sphinx handles the `:property:` option in the `py:method` directive to ensure that it does not append parens to index entries. This typically involves understanding the underlying code responsible for handling directives and generating index entries in the Sphinx system.

For this, I should examine methods or classes in the codebase that are responsible for processing the `py:method` and the `py:property` directives and their index generation logic.

I do not have specific files where these methods might be located, so I'll begin by searching for relevant methods like those dealing with directives related to Python objects, properties, and index handling logic throughout the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("handle_directive")
search_method_in_codebase("python_method_directive")
search_method_in_codebase("python_property_directive")
```

To implement the `subprocess.run` with `PGPASSWORD` in Django's PostgreSQL backend, it is crucial to locate and modify the appropriate method. Currently, I haven't identified the relevant method or class within the Django PostgreSQL backend, specifically `django.db.backends.postgresql`.

Based on the provided results, it looks like there might be a connection with the `DatabaseClient` class since there is a reference to `DatabaseClient.runshell_db(dbinfo)` in the retrieved test code.

To proceed:

1. I need to search the class `DatabaseClient` within the PostgreSQL backend to understand how it runs the PostgreSQL shell or client command.
2. I need to explore the method that is responsible for executing the shell command, potentially involving environment variables.

I'll perform searches targeting these specific components to acquire necessary details for the patch.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("DatabaseClient")
search_method_in_codebase("runshell_db")
```

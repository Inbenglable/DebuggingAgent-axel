#### ISSUE
caplog fixture doesn't restore log level after test
From the documentation at https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.0.0/logging.html#caplog-fixture, "The log levels set are restored automatically at the end of the test".
It used to work, but looks broken in new 6.0 release. Minimal example to reproduce:

```
def test_foo(caplog):
    caplog.set_level(42)

def test_bar(caplog):
    print(caplog.handler.level)
```

It prints "0" for pytest<6, "42" after.

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
The provided test script consists of two tests: `test_foo` and `test_bar`. The issue arises because `caplog.set_level(42)` modifies the log handler's level to 42 in `test_foo`. The expectation, as per the documentation, is that the log level should automatically reset to its original level after `test_foo` completes. However, in `test_bar`, the log level is not reset; it remains 42, leading to a test failure due to the expectation that it should be the default level (`logging.NOTSET`).

The error `NameError: name 'logging' is not defined` in the traceback indicates a missing import statement, which needs to be addressed for the assertion to check the log level against `logging.NOTSET`. However, this is secondary to the main functional issue, which is the log level not being reset correctly between tests.

The primary task is to identify where in the pytest codebase the caplog fixture should be restoring the log levels, and why it's failing to do so. The abnormal behavior can be traced to the mechanism responsible for resetting the log level in the caplog fixture.

Next, we will trace the `caplog` fixture's behavior to understand why the log level is not being restored between tests.

Observed method: `src/_pytest/logging.py:LogCaptureFixture.handler`
==================================================
Based on the current observations, we're focusing on the `LogCaptureFixture.handler` method, which is responsible for returning the `LogCaptureHandler`. The method code suggests that it retrieves the handler from some internal store (`self._item._store[caplog_handler_key]`), which implies the handler setup is tied to `_item` and its store dictionary. However, this method itself only returns the handler; it doesn't directly deal with log levels.

Given this, the issue may reside in how the handler's log level is managed between tests, possibly involving the initialization or teardown procedures of the caplog fixture.

Since we've inspected the retrieval method and haven't located the code responsible for resetting the log level, we should trace deeper into the method that sets or resets log levels within the fixtures or handlers.

Observed scope: `src/_pytest/logging.py:340-360`

This range should provide insights into the setup and teardown mechanisms associated with the log levels.
==================================================
From the provided code snippet and tracing information, we can gain insights into the `LogCaptureFixture` class, specifically focusing on the `_finalize` method, which, according to the docstring, is intended to restore log levels modified by the `set_level` method. 

The `_finalize` method iterates over a dictionary (`self._initial_logger_levels`) that stores the initial log levels for loggers by name and attempts to reset the loggers to these initial levels. This suggests that there is a mechanism already in place to restore log levels, but it seems not to be functioning as expected.

Given the design of the code, we need to examine:

1. How and when `_finalize` is being called in the test lifecycle.
2. Whether `self._initial_logger_levels` is being correctly populated during the setup of the fixture.
3. If the method is being invoked at the correct time to restore the levels after each test.

As the trace did not provide enough specific information about why `_finalize` isn't operating correctly, and we need more information about its lifecycle integration. Hence, the next step would be to trace further into the method that might be responsible for initializing or invoking `_finalize`.

Observed method: `src/_pytest/logging.py:LogCaptureFixture.__init__`
==================================================
### Analysis

1. **Current Observations**:
   - The `LogCaptureFixture.__init__` method initializes `_initial_logger_levels` as an empty dictionary designed to store initial log levels of loggers (`self._initial_logger_levels = {}`).
   - There's an indication from previous traces that `self._initial_logger_levels` should be populated with log levels during initialization so that the `_finalize` method can restore them later.

2. **Program Behavior**:
   - Issue arises because log levels are not being restored between tests. This suggests either an incomplete population of `_initial_logger_levels` or improper invocation of `_finalize` method.

### Next Steps

To diagnose why `_initial_logger_levels` isn't functioning properly, we must inspect more around the initialization phase (`__init__`) and any methods that interact with `_initial_logger_levels`.

I propose we delve deeper into the surrounding methods which likely include setup code for loggers and may call `_finalize`.

### Action

Observed Scope: `src/_pytest/logging.py:320-340`

This range should include methods immediately before the initialization, possibly containing setup logic or preliminary interactions with `_initial_logger_levels`.

Let's trace further to locate the point of failure, enabling us to identify potential fixes.
==================================================
### Analysis of Current Observations:
The trace provided for `LogCaptureFixture.__init__` reveals various parts of the initialization method related to `LogCaptureFixture`. However, the lines observed (320-340) do not directly tackle the issue of `_initial_logger_levels` and its population to restore log levels between tests. Here's an analysis of what's visible so far:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The `LogCaptureFixture` initializes some properties (`records`, `stream`) and overrides methods like `emit`, `reset`, and `handleError`. 

2. **Logging Levels**:
   - These lines do not address the initialization or manipulation of log levels, nor the `_initial_logger_levels`. Instead, they are focused on handling log records and error management.

3. **Traceback**:
   - The error `AssertionError` related to file path checking from the traceback suggests a problem with setup or file path resolution during the debugging test wrapper, but this is not specific to the pytest code causing the logging issue.

### Next Steps:
To address the bug related to caplog fixture not restoring log levels, we need to observe further methods in `LogCaptureFixture` that would involve log level setup or restoration. The initialization (lines 320-340) isn't tackling the restoration mechanism enough, indicating a need for inspecting methods that deal with logger level setup/reset specifically.

### Action:
Continue tracing the operation that deals with setting and resetting log levels within the `LogCaptureFixture`.

**Observed method**: `src/_pytest/logging.py:LogCaptureFixture._finalize`
==================================================
### Analysis of Current Observations:

The method `LogCaptureFixture._finalize` is intended to restore log levels that were changed by the `caplog.set_level` method. Here are the key observations:

- **Restoration Mechanism**: The `_finalize` method iterates over the `_initial_logger_levels` dictionary, which is supposed to store the initial logging levels for various loggers. It then resets each logger to its stored initial level using `logger.setLevel(level)`.

- **Potential Cause**: If `_initial_logger_levels` is not being properly populated with initial log levels at the setup stage or is not being correctly invoked, the levels will not reset properly between tests. This would lead to persistent log levels (like 42) into subsequent tests, as seen in the issue.

- **Error Information**: The observed `AssertionError` in the traceback is unrelated to the pytest implementation directly; it seems to be part of a test setup issue with the debugger's configuration rather than a cause of the caplog issue.

### Next Step:

To better understand why the log levels are not being correctly reset, we need to delve into the methods that involve setting up or populating `_initial_logger_levels` in the initial stages of the fixture's lifecycle.

Given the current state, it's crucial to explore the setup process or other aspects of `LogCaptureFixture` that handle logger level initialization.

### Action:

Observed scope: `src/_pytest/logging.py:300-320`

This range should contain the necessary setup or initialization logic that interacts with `_initial_logger_levels` and needs to be further investigated for issues preventing proper log level restoration. Let's continue tracing this area to determine where the breakdown occurs in resetting the log levels.
==================================================
### Analysis of Current Observations:

1. **Restoration Logic**: 
   - This snippet contains parts of the teardown logic in the `__exit__` method that resets the root logger's level (`root_logger.setLevel(self.orig_level)`) and removes the handler (`root_logger.removeHandler(self.handler)`).
   - This mechanism effectively restores any modified logging level on the exit of the context, assuming it was originally captured correctly in `self.orig_level`.

2. **Logger Level Setting**: 
   - The initialization phase (`if self.level is not None:`) involves capturing and potentially altering the root logger level (`root_logger.setLevel(min(self.orig_level, self.level))`), aiming to enforce a temporary level during the handler's lifecycle.
   - This should store the original level in `self.orig_level` and thus be ready to restore it in the `__exit__`.

3. **Error/Traceback Insight**:
   - The observed `AssertionError` is related to testing/debugging setup rather than directly influencing the logging mechanism; it checks a file path within the testing infrastructure rather than affecting the `caplog` fixture functionality.

### Conclusion:
The snippet itself focuses on capturing and restoring the root logger level correctly which should work if `self.orig_level` is initialized and used properly. However, given the observed issue, this mechanism might not trigger for specific logger fixtures like `caplog`, indicating a potential flaw in how/when these attributes (_initial_logger_levels or orig_level) are set or reset between tests. 

Buggy method: `src/_pytest/logging.py:LogCaptureFixture._finalize`

We can identify this as the area potentially responsible for failing to reset levels properly across tests. The next step involves proposing a fix or testing to ensure `_finalize` properly restores all levels according to the caplog requirements, possibly by ensuring complete and correct population of `_initial_logger_levels`.
==================================================


Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

### IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

### IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

To evaluate whether the issue is resolved, let's review the provided patch and the test output analysis:

### Patch Review
The patch modifies the condition in the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass to check if a value is either a function or a data descriptor. The patch uses `inspect.isdatadescriptor(val)` in place of solely relying on `inspect.isfunction(val)`. This is intended to include properties since properties are data descriptors and not functions. The patch adds a new helper function `is_data_descriptor(val)` to make this check more explicit.

### Test Output Analysis

#### Original Output
The original output shows that the assertion for the method docstring passes, but the assertion for the property docstring fails because the property docstring is not inherited. This failure shows that the issue is present.

#### Patched Output
The patched output is empty, indicating that no exceptions were raised. This tells us that both assertions passed:
- The method docstring is inherited correctly.
- The property docstring is inherited as expected after applying the patch.

### Conclusion
Given that the patched output doesn't contain any errors or exceptions, it suggests that both the method and property docstrings are inherited correctly from the `Base` class to the `Derived` class. Therefore, the issue with the property docstring inheritance, as detailed in the bug report, is resolved.

Issue resolved: `True`

To address the issue, I need to investigate the `quantity_input` decorator's implementation and see how it handles method return values. It seems that the error occurs because the decorator is trying to invoke the `to` method on a `None` value.

First, I need to find the source code for the `quantity_input` decorator within the `astropy` project. Once I have identified the relevant part of the code, I can modify it to handle cases where the return value is `None`.

I'll start by searching for the `quantity_input` function within the codebase to examine its implementation.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("quantity_input")
```

To address the issue, I will replace Django's `escape` method with Python's built-in `html.escape`. This involves updating the implementation in `django/utils/html.py` to use `html.escape`:

```pythony
### django/utils/html.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def escape(text):
    """
    Return the given text with ampersands, quotes and angle brackets encoded
    for use in HTML.

    Always escape input, even if it's already escaped and marked as such.
    This may result in double-escaping. If this is a concern, use
    conditional_escape() instead.
    """
    return mark_safe(str(text).translate(_html_escapes))
=======
import html

def escape(text):
    """
    Return the given text with ampersands, quotes and angle brackets encoded
    for use in HTML.

    Always escape input, even if it's already escaped and marked as such.
    This may result in double-escaping. If this is a concern, use
    conditional_escape() instead.
    """
    return mark_safe(html.escape(str(text)))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Here's the JSON representation of the edit:

```json

  "search_replace_edits": [

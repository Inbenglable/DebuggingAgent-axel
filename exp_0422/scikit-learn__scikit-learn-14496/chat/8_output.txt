Here is the patch required to address the issue of `min_samples` being a float when passed to `NearestNeighbors`:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sklearn/cluster/optics_.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        min_samples = max(2, min_samples * n_samples)\n=======\n        min_samples = int(round(max(2, min_samples * n_samples)))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

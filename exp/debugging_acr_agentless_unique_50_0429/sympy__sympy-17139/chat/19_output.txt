Based on the observations and acquired understanding of the `_TR56` function in the `sympy/simplify/fu.py` file, we need to ensure that comparisons with complex numbers are avoided or handled correctly. Specifically, the lines comparing `rv.exp` need modification so that they only execute when `rv.exp` can be validly compared, i.e., when it is a real number.

To resolve the issue, we will modify the function to bypass illegal comparisons by utilizing the `rv.exp.is_real` property to determine when the exponent is real and can be compared, thereby circumventing the `TypeError`.

Here's the proposed patch:

```pythony
### sympy/simplify/fu.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if (rv.exp < 0) == True:
            return rv
        if (rv.exp > max) == True:
=======
        if rv.exp.is_real and (rv.exp < 0):
            return rv
        if rv.exp.is_real and (rv.exp > max):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This patch checks the reality of `rv.exp` before performing comparisons, fixing the issue without disrupting the function's original logic and expected behavior for real cases.

Here's the JSON representation of the patch:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/simplify/fu.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if (rv.exp < 0) == True:\n            return rv\n        if (rv.exp > max) == True:\n=======\n        if rv.exp.is_real and (rv.exp < 0):\n            return rv\n        if rv.exp.is_real and (rv.exp > max):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

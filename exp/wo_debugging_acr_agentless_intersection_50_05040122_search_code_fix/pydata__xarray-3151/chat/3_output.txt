The issue with `xr.combine_by_coords` stems from the checks for monotonic coordinates within the method. To address the problem, we need to modify the behavior when coordinates are identical across datasets and allow them to bypass the monotonicity checks. The methods `_infer_concat_order_from_coords`, `_check_shape_tile_ids`, and `_combine_nd` have been reviewed, which gives us a clearer understanding of their roles. These methods revolve around organizing, checking, and performing the actual combination of datasets.

Given the insight from these methods, I now know how these are utilized, particularly in enforcing the monotonic order and using coordinates to infer concatenation details. I'm ready to generate a patch that will adjust the monotonicity requirements in `combine_by_coords`.

Ready generation: `True`

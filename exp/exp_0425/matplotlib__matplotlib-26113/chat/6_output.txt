Based on the analysis of the patch, the change made involves modifying the condition from `len(acc) > mincnt` to `len(acc) >= mincnt`. This directly addresses the issue described in the bug report, where the inconsistency arises due to the condition checking for "greater than" instead of "greater than or equal to."

The original test output and the patched test output both show no differences, confirmed by an empty output for both. This means the patch does not introduce any exceptions or crashes, implying code stability.

Thus, with the problem described in the bug report involving the behavior of `mincnt` parameter depending on the presence of `C` being alleviated by the change from `>` to `>=`, it is reasonable to conclude that the issue has been resolved.

Issue resolved: `True`

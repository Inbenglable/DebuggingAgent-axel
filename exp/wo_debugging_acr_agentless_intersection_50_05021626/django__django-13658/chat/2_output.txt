To resolve the issue, I need to modify the `ManagementUtility` class, specifically to adjust the instantiation of `CommandParser`. For this, I will need the source code of the `__init__` method and any related code sections dealing with `CommandParser`. Let's search for the `__init__` method in the `django/core/management/__init__.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/management/__init__.py", "ManagementUtility.__init__")
```

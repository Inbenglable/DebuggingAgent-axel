To solve the issue, we need to ensure that the `latex_expr` is wrapped in parentheses if necessary during LaTeX printing. Let's update the code for the `_print_Subs` method:

```pythony
### sympy/printing/latex.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        latex_expr = self._print(expr)
=======
        latex_expr = r'\left(%s\right)' % self._print(expr)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the expression is always enclosed in parentheses when being printed with LaTeX, which adheres to the desired output format.

Finally, here is the edit in the specified format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/printing/latex.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        latex_expr = self._print(expr)\n=======\n        latex_expr = r'\\left(%s\\right)' % self._print(expr)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

To resolve the issue of properly handling nominal scales in the `Plotter._finalize_figure` method, we need to ensure that these scales use margins for tick marks similar to those of categorical scales. Below is the patch in the **SEARCH/REPLACE** format that addresses the issue:

```pythony
### seaborn/_core/plot.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                    if isinstance(a, str):
=======
                    # Adjust ticks for nominal scales similar to categorical scales
                    if isinstance(a, str) or isinstance(scale, Nominal):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### seaborn/_core/plot.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                    if isinstance(a, str):\n=======\n                    # Adjust ticks for nominal scales similar to categorical scales\n                    if isinstance(a, str) or isinstance(scale, Nominal):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch modifies the conditional clause so that both categorical and nominal scales are adjusted by considering them similarly, which should resolve the identified issue of nominal scale behavior in Seaborn's plotter functionality.

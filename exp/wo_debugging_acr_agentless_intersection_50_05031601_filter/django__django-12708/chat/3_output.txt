To address the issue with the `_delete_composed_index` method and its interaction with both `unique_together` and `index_together`, we need to review how constraints are generated and managed in the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class. Specifically, the `_constraint_names` method, which is used to retrieve the constraints within `_delete_composed_index`, will likely need modifications to correctly identify and differentiate between unique and index constraints. I need to retrieve the source code of the `_constraint_names` method.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "_constraint_names")
```

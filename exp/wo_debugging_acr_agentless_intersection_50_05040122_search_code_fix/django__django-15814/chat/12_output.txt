To fix the issue, we have identified that the line `opts = cur_model._meta` in the file `django/db/models/sql/query.py` should be replaced with `opts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta`. This change should address the problem of `QuerySet.only()` after `select_related()` crashing on proxy models by ensuring the correct model options are being used.

Here is the patch using the SEARCH/REPLACE format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/sql/query.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                opts = cur_model._meta\n=======\n                opts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

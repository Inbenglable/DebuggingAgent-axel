The issue is related to the function `kahane_simplify()`, which is specifically used in the `sympy` library, likely within modules related to mathematical operations or physics. To address the issue, I need to review the current implementation of the `kahane_simplify()` function to understand how the leading gamma matrices are handled. This will enable me to identify the part of the code that needs modification.

I will search for the `kahane_simplify()` method in the codebase to ensure I have the correct source code for generating a patch.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("kahane_simplify")
```

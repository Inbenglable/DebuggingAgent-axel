To resolve the issue, I need to gather the source code for the `_check_homomorphism` function and the `_image` function where the problem was identified. Since the issue is specifically in the `sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py` file as per the link provided, I'll start by searching for these methods in that file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py", "_check_homomorphism")
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py", "_image")
```

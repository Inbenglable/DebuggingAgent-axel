The error message indicates that Django settings have not been properly configured before attempting to import modules that require access to those settings. Specifically, the error occurs while trying to import `GenericForeignKey` from `django.contrib.contenttypes.fields`.

The crucial steps involved include:

1. **Import Statements**: The script attempts to import Django modules requiring configuration.
2. **Settings Configuration**: The test script uses `settings.configure()` to manually set Django settings instead of relying on a pre-configured settings module.

The traceback shows that the error is raised when accessing `settings.INSTALLED_APPS` during the import process, suggesting that the settings were not properly configured prior to accessing Django's model-related modules.

Given this issue, we'll first check the logic in the script where the settings are configured. The relevant lines are:

```python
# Configure Django settings
settings.configure(
    DEBUG=True,
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': ':memory:',
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=[
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        __name__,
    ],
    TEST_RUNNER='django.test.runner.DiscoverRunner',
)
```

The settings configuration needs to occur before any Django imports that depend on those settings.

Letâ€™s follow the traceback suggestion back to its origin and analyze the configuration further before imports. However, if settings are configured after import statements, they'll lead to erroneous outcomes when accessing specific modules.

Therefore, the initial point to consider is the settings setup process. If configured after dependent imports, it results in the `ImproperlyConfigured` error. 

In the script's flow, the settings configuration should proceed all imports or execution requiring Django context.

Given the nature of the issue, the script setup implies imports and configuration as primary sources of mismanagement.

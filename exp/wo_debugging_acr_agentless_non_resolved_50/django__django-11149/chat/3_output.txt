To resolve the issue, I need to inspect the `InlineModelAdmin` class, which is the parent class for `TabularInline`, to see how permission checks are implemented. This will help me understand how the rendering logic determines the editability of inlines in the admin interface based on user permissions.

I'll retrieve the source code for the `InlineModelAdmin` class to gather the necessary information.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/contrib/admin/options.py", "InlineModelAdmin")
```

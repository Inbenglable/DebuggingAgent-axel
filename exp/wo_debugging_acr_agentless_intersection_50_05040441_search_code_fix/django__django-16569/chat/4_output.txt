To determine whether the issue is fixed, let's review the information step by step:

### Review of the Issue and Patch

**Issue Description:**
- When calling `FormSet.empty_form()` with `self.can_delete == True` and `self.can_delete_extra == False`, the `add_fields()` method raises a `TypeError` because the `index` argument is compared to `initial_form_count` without checking if `index` is `None`.

**Proposed Patch:**
- The patch modifies the line checking `index < initial_form_count` to also check that `index` is not `None` before the comparison: 
  ```python
  if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or (index is not None and index < initial_form_count)):
  ```

### Test Output Analysis

**Original Output:**
- The test previously resulted in a `TypeError` being raised, indicating the comparison failed when `index` was `None`.

**Patched Output:**
- After applying the patch, the output no longer raises a `TypeError`, and the representation of the `empty_form` is printed correctly.
- The message "The issue is fixed." is also printed, confirming the absence of exceptions.

### Conclusion

The patch successfully addresses the issue by adding a crucial check to ensure that `index` is not `None` before performing the comparison. The test output after applying the patch demonstrates that the `TypeError` no longer occurs, verifying the bug is fixed.

Issue resolved: `True`

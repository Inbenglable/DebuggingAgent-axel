The patch provided introduces a function `parse_version` which converts version strings into tuples of integers. This is a necessary step for performing a correct, numerical comparison of version numbers, thus addressing the issue described where versions were compared lexically as strings.

However, when analyzing the test output before and after applying the patch, there is no change in the results. The original and patched outputs both show an `AssertionError`, indicating that the version check is still failing with the same message. This suggests that either the patch was not applied correctly in the test, or there is an issue with the reproducibility test itself not correctly simulating the patched function's environment.

Since the output remains the same and the error is not resolved, the patch did not fix the issue as expected in this context.

Issue resolved: `False`

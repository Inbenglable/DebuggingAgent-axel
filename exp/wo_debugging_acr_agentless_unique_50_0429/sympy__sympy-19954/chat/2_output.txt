To resolve the issue, we need to understand the `sylow_subgroup` and `minimal_blocks` methods. Both methods have been retrieved, and the problem seems to be related to indexing operations where the block systems are being manipulated.

### Issue Analysis
The traceback indicates that the error occurs in the `minimal_blocks` method, specifically during list mutation operations where elements are being deleted from lists, which are `num_blocks` and `blocks`. Given the design of these deletion operations, it may be useful to first examine whether the list is being traversed correctly, and whether its dimensions are correctly checked before deletion operations.

### Patch Strategy
1. **Safe Mutation** - Before deleting elements within a list, ensure that the index is within bounds. This typically means verifying the current index against the length of the list after any deletion.

2. **Comprehensive Debugging** - Introduce logging or debug statements around the mutation code block to ensure the current state of lists is as expected.

3. **Check for Trivial Cases** - If the list is empty or if there's singular behavior, consider early exit strategies for `minimal_blocks`.

Now that I've analyzed the necessary code, I can proceed with creating the patch for the identified issue.

To resolve the deprecation warnings related to out-of-bound integer conversions, we need to inspect the code within the `matplotlib.colors` module where these warnings are generated. Based on the provided traceback, the relevant lines of code are around line 730 in the `colors.py` file, likely within a single method or class.

To proceed, the header (method or class) near those lines should be identified. Since the file and some of the lines within the `colors.py` file are indicated, I will proceed with searching for the class or method surrounding these lines to better understand the existing code and make the necessary adjustments.

```python
search_code_in_file("lib/matplotlib/colors.py", "xa[xa > self.N - 1] = self._i_over")
```

From the provided trace and issue description, we can see that the error occurs within the `evalf` function in the `sympy/core/evalf.py` file. The specific line causing the `UnboundLocalError` is when the local variable `reprec` is being referenced before assignment.

The error arises when the `evalf` function is handling the case where the multiplication involves elements like `Max` that are not directly supported in the `evalf_table`. The code reaches an execution path where `reprec` and `imprec` are not assigned a value before they are used.

To resolve this, we need to trace the handling of expressions that aren't found in `evalf_table` and understand why the `reprec` and `imprec` aren't being set. It seems likely that an additional conditional or default handling may be needed when the function does not fit known cases.

Let's observe the method leading to the `UnboundLocalError`.

To resolve this issue, I need to first locate and review the `model_to_dict` method's source code within the Django codebase. This will allow me to verify the problem and make the necessary correction. Since the file path is not provided, I'll begin by searching for the `model_to_dict` method across the entire codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("model_to_dict")
```

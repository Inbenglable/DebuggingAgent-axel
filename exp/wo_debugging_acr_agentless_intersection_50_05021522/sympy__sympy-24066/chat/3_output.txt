To resolve the issue, I need to inspect the `Dimension` class and relevant parts of the code that might interact with or affect dimensional analysis, since the bug is related to dimension detection.

Let's start by searching for the `Dimension` class and any related methods used in dimensional analysis or conversion.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Dimension")
search_method_in_codebase("UnitSystem.get_dimension_system")
search_method_in_codebase("UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension")
search_code_in_codebase("is_dimensionless")
```

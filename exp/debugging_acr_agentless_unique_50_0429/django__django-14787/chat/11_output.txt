The patch attempts to preserve function attributes by modifying the approach in `_multi_decorate` to use the `wraps` function directly on the `functools.partial` object. However, while the intention is clear, the patched output shows that an `AttributeError` is still occurring, albeit for a different attribute (`__module__` instead of `__name__`).

### Analysis:
1. **Original Issue:** The function passed to the decorator was a `functools.partial` object, which didn't have function attributes such as `__name__`, resulting in an `AttributeError`.

2. **Proposed Patch:** Modify `_multi_decorate` to use `wraps` directly on the partial object to try to retain method attributes.

3. **Patched Output:** Indicates that the modification leads to another `AttributeError`, this time for the `__module__` attribute, suggesting that the patch does not adequately address the underlying problem of maintaining all necessary function attributes.

4. **Conclusion:** The issue remains unresolved because the patched version resulted in a similar error related to missing function attributes.

Therefore, the issue is not fixed.

Issue resolved: `False`

You are a PR reviewer that needs to review the patch generated by a bug repair agent and determine whether the issue is fixed or not.
This is the bug issue, which is in the **sympy** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
S(0.0) == S.false returns True
This issue is related to those listed in #20033. 

As shown by @sayandip18, comparing `S.false` to `S(0.0)` returns 2 different results depending on the order in which they are compared:

```pycon
>>> from sympy import *
>>> S(0.0) == S.false
True
>>> S.false == S(0.0)
False
```
Based on the results of comparison to `S(0)`:

```pycon
>>> S(0) == S.false
False
>>> S.false == S(0)
False
```
I assume we would want `S(0.0) == S.false` to return True as well?

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
## REPRODUCE TEST
```
# reproducer.py

from sympy import S
import traceback
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        # Reproduce the issue
        assert S(0.0) == S.false, "S(0.0) == S.false should be True"
        assert not (S.false == S(0.0)), "S.false == S(0.0) should be False"
        
        print("All checks passed. The issue is fixed.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

And this is the original output when running the test (before applying the patch):
## ORIGINAL OUTPUT
```
All checks passed. The issue is fixed.

```

The repair agent has tried to generate a patch to fix the issue:
## PATCH CONTEXT
<PATCH_CONTEXT>
Given the information gathered, the disparity between `S(0.0) == S.false` and `S.false == S(0.0)` stems from how the equality comparison is handled for the `Float` class when dealing with `Boolean` instances. The `Float.__eq__` method is currently returning `False` when compared with instances of `Boolean`.

The current behavior is the result of the `Float.__eq__` method containing `if isinstance(other, Boolean): return False`, which is affecting the comparison logic between `S(0.0)` and `S.false`.

To resolve this, we need to adjust this logic to make `Float.__eq__` return `True` when `self` is `0.0` and `other` is `S.false`.

The patch should thus modify the `Float.__eq__` method to check if the float is zero before comparing with a boolean object:

```pythony
### sympy/core/numbers.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if isinstance(other, Boolean):
            return False
=======
        if isinstance(other, Boolean):
            return not self
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit will ensure that `S(0.0) == S.false` returns `True` by allowing `0.0` to be equal to `False`, maintaining consistency across different comparison directions.

The final json patch representation:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/core/numbers.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if isinstance(other, Boolean):\n            return False\n=======\n        if isinstance(other, Boolean):\n            return not self\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```
</PATCH_CONTEXT>

After applying the patch, the output of the test is:
## PATCHED OUTPUT
```
All checks passed. The issue is fixed.

```

Now, please first review the patch and analyse the test output before and after the patch, to determine whether the issue is fixed or not.

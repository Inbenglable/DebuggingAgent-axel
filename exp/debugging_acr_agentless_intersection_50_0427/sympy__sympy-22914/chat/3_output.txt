**Observed Issue:**

The issue arises from the fact that the `PythonCodePrinter` does not support the `Min` and `Max` functions from the sympy library, resulting in an inability to generate Python code for these functions. This is evident from the error messages displayed when attempting to print the Python code for the expression `Min(a, b)`.

**Analyzed Code Behavior:**

The script is trying to generate Python code for a sympy `Min` object using `pycode()`. However, the generated output is `((a) if (a <= b) else (b))`, instead of the expected `min(a, b)`. This indicates that the `_print_Min` method of `PythonCodePrinter` has not been properly overridden to handle the `Min` function.

**Next Steps:**

To resolve the issue, we need to locate the `PythonCodePrinter.doprint` method where custom behavior for printing `Min` and `Max` should be implemented.

**Observed method: `sympy/printing/pycode.py:PythonCodePrinter.doprint`**

## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
S(0.0) == S.false returns True
This issue is related to those listed in #20033. 

As shown by @sayandip18, comparing `S.false` to `S(0.0)` returns 2 different results depending on the order in which they are compared:

```pycon
>>> from sympy import *
>>> S(0.0) == S.false
True
>>> S.false == S(0.0)
False
```
Based on the results of comparison to `S(0)`:

```pycon
>>> S(0) == S.false
False
>>> S.false == S(0)
False
```
I assume we would want `S(0.0) == S.false` to return True as well?

In the previous round, you called search APIs to retrieve relevant source code that would help identify the root cause of the issue and generate a patch. However, the code you retrieved appears in multiple locations (maybe some are irrelevant but have same key). So now your task is to determine which of the retrieved contents are indeed you need, and filter out the irrelevant ones.
This is your API invocation round output:
To resolve the issue, I need to examine how the `==` operator is implemented for `S(0.0)`, `S.false`, and `S(0)`. These are instances of SymPy's singleton classes. I suspect the issue lies within the equality handling of these objects, possibly in the `Expr` or `Boolean` class implementations. 

I will need to locate and inspect the relevant class implementations and their `__eq__` methods to understand the current logic.

Let's begin by searching for the relevant classes and their methods in order to understand how the equality mechanism works in these cases.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("__eq__")
```


And this is the corresponding API returned result (each content is started with #### FILE_PATH:NAME):

Among the API returned contents, there may be some irrelevant ones or not. So now you need to analyze each returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.
Now, please first analyze the API returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.

Then you need to choose you needed ones with the following format:
```
FILE_PATH_1:NAME_1
FILE_PATH_2:NAME_2
...
```

Note:
1. The value of FILE_PATH:NAME, must consistent with the API returned content (but remove the prefix ####).
2. You may select one or more contents, or even all of them if they are indeed you need.

To solve this issue, I need to examine the `merge_core` function because it is identified as the next step in the call stack after `dataset_merge_method`. 

I'll search for `merge_core` in the xarray project codebase to inspect its implementation.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("merge_core")
```

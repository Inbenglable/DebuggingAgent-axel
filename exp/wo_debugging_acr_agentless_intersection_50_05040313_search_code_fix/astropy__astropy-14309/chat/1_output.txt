To resolve the issue, I need to check the source code of the `is_fits` function located in `astropy/io/fits/connect.py`. This is crucial because the error traceback points to line 72 of this file where the `IndexError` occurs. Additionally, I should inspect the `identify_format` method in `astropy/io/registry/base.py`, which calls `is_fits` and is involved in handling file format identification.

I'll start by retrieving the source code of both methods:

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/io/fits/connect.py", "is_fits")
search_method_in_file("astropy/io/registry/base.py", "identify_format")
```

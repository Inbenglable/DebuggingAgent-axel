After examining the API result, the relevant file needed is the one containing the `Lookup.__init__` method as it directly corresponds to the `lookup_class.__init__` query, which is the instantiation potentially dealing with the RHS value being a `SimpleLazyObject`.

The examined listing indicates:
```
django/db/models/lookups.py:Lookup.__init__
```
This location is relevant because it contains the initialization method for `Lookup` objects, which is responsible for handling the left-hand side (lhs) and right-hand side (rhs) expressions within Django ORM queries, as mentioned in the traceback related to the bug issue.

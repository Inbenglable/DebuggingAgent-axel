**Patch Review:**

The proposed patch aims to fix a problem with the username validator regex in Django, which unintentionally allows usernames to end with a newline. 

The change involves modifying the regex patterns in both the `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` classes from:

```python
regex = r'^[\w.@+-]+$'
```

to:

```python
regex = r'\A[\w.@+-]+\Z'
```

This change correctly shifts from using `^` and `$` to `\A` and `\Z` to ensure that trailing newlines are not permitted, thus directly addressing the issue reported.

**Test Analysis:**

- **Original Output:** The original test output indicates that the validators do not raise an error for usernames ending with a newline, thus confirming the presence of the issue.

- **Patched Output:** After applying the patch, the test results show a traceback from raising a `ValidationError`. This indicates that the validators now correctly reject usernames ending with a newline, as expected. However, there is an additional error related to Django settings, specifically an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception, which suggests that Django's settings are not correctly loaded in the test environment.

Despite the issue with the settings, the core functionality being tested (i.e., the username regex validation) appears to be fixed, as the test effectively demonstrates that the patched validators prevent usernames with trailing newlines.

**Conclusion:**

The patch successfully amends the validator regex to prevent trailing newline characters, effectively resolving the specific bug mentioned in the issue. Even though there are additional errors due to settings misconfiguration, they do not pertain to the patch itself but rather the test environment setup.

Issue resolved: `True`

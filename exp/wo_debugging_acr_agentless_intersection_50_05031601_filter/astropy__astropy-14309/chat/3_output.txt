To resolve the `IndexError: tuple index out of range` issue in the `identify_format` method due to changes in `is_fits`, we'll ensure that the code safely accesses `args[0]` only when `args` is not empty. This will address the index out-of-bounds error by checking the length of `args` before attempting to access it. Below are the relevant changes in the form of search/replace patches.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### astropy/io/fits/connect.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    return isinstance(args[0], (HDUList, TableHDU, BinTableHDU, GroupsHDU))\n=======\n    return len(args) > 0 and isinstance(args[0], (HDUList, TableHDU, BinTableHDU, GroupsHDU))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This change adds a conditional check to ensure that `args` is not empty before attempting to access its first element, preventing the `IndexError`. The overall functionality should remain intact, as the previous logic is only executed if `args` contains elements.

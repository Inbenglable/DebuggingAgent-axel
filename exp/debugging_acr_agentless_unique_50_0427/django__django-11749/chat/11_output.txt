To determine whether the issue is fixed:

### Analysis of the Issue and Proposed Patch

1. **Issue Summary:**
   - The issue arises because `call_command()` does not handle mutually exclusive argument groups correctly when passed as keyword arguments. In the given test, using `shop_id` as a keyword argument in `call_command('command', shop_id=1)` raises an error because the mutually exclusive nature of the arguments is not being respected.

2. **Patch Overview:**
   - The patch introduces logic to handle mutually exclusive groups within `call_command()`. It checks for required mutually exclusive groups and ensures that if one option in the group is provided via keyword arguments, the command is properly constructed and executed.

### Test Outputs

1. **Original Test Output:**
   - The original test results in a `CommandError` due to the unrecognized command and subsequent `AssertionError` confirming that `call_command` fails when using `shop_id` as a keyword argument.

2. **Patched Test Output:**
   - The output after applying the patch remains identical to the original output. The test still results in a `CommandError` for the unknown command and an `AssertionError`.

### Conclusion

- Despite the patch attempting to address the underlying issue with mutually exclusive groups, the test still fails with the same errors indicating that the patch did not effectively fix the issue presented.

### Final Determination

Issue resolved: `False`

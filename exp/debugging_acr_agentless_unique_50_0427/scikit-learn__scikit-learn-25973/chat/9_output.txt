Upon reviewing the provided patch and the test outputs before and after the application of the patch, here are my observations:

1. **Patch Explanation**: The proposed patch attempts to resolve the issue by checking if `self.cv` is an instance of `Generator`. If so, it converts it into a list for reusability during the cross-validation process in `cross_val_score`.

2. **Patched Output Analysis**: After applying the patch, a `NameError` occurs because the identifier `Generator` is not defined in the scope where it's being used. This indicates that the patch did not successfully fix the issue, and a necessary import or definition for `Generator` is missing.

3. **Test Output Before Patch**: Initially, the test fails with an `IndexError`, indicating that the list is being accessed out of range due to the generator being exhausted.

4. **Test Output After Patch**: With the patch, the code fails with a `NameError`, which shows that the implementation of the patch introduced an error without resolving the original issue.

Given that the patch leads to a new error and does not resolve the original problem, the issue is still present.

**Issue resolved: False**

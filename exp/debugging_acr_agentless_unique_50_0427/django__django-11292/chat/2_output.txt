The error message indicates that the `--skip-checks` option is not recognized when calling a management command in Django. This means the option is not correctly implemented or registered in the command parser.

Looking at the traceback, we see the following sequence:

1. `call_command('check', '--skip-checks')` is invoked.
2. Within `django.core.management.__init__.py`, `call_command` creates a parser and attempts to parse arguments.
3. The error originates when calling `parser.parse_args()` within `django.core.management.base.CommandParser`.
4. The unrecognized argument error is raised from within `argparse.py`.

Based on this, we need to investigate how arguments are registered in `create_parser` and whether `--skip-checks` is included in those command-specific argument definitions.

Observed method: `django/core/management/base.py:CommandParser.parse_args`

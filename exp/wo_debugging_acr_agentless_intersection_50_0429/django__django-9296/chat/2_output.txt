To implement the `__iter__` method in the `Paginator` class, we need access to the source code of the class to insert the new method in the appropriate location. Thus, we need to retrieve the source code of the `Paginator` class first.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/core/paginator.py", "Paginator")
```

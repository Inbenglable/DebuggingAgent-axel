The issue seems to arise because the `dataset_merge_method` function is expecting the `other` parameter to be of the same type as a `Dataset` or something that can be coerced into a dictionary, which doesn't work with `DataArray`. To fix this, we need to modify the `dataset_merge_method` function implementation to handle `DataArray` objects properly. 

We retrieved the code for `dataset_merge_method` and `Dataset.merge`, and now we have sufficient information to generate the patch to modify the `dataset_merge_method` so it can transform a `DataArray` into an appropriate form before attempting to merge it. 

Ready generation: `True`

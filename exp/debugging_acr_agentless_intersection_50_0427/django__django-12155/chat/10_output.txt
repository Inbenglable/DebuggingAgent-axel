The testing setup included in the reproduction test initially attempts to import `simplify_exception` from `django.contrib.admindocs.views`, resulting in an `ImportError`. This error prevents the test from actually running the patch logic concerning the `trim_docstring` function and evaluating its impact.

The patch itself correctly modifies the `trim_docstring` function to avoid processing the first line when calculating indentation, which should theoretically resolve the bug described. However, since the test does not proceed due to the import issue, it's impossible to verify the functionality of the `trim_docstring` modification in practice through the provided test output.

Given that both the original and patched test outputs report the same `ImportError`, it can be concluded that the issue hasn't been effectively tested, and therefore, the status of the issue cannot be confirmed as resolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

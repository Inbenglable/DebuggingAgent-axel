To generate the patch, I need to retrieve the source code for the `runshell_db` method in the `DatabaseClient` class because it contains the implementation logic that likely interacts with the PostgreSQL client. This is where the usage of `subprocess.run` along with the environment variable `PGPASSWORD` should be refactored.

I'll first retrieve the implementation details of the `runshell_db` method.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py", "DatabaseClient.runshell_db")
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py", "DatabaseClient.runshell")
```

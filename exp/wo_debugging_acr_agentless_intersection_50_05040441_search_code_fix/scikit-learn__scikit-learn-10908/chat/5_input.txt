This is the bug issue, which is in the **scikit-learn** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
CountVectorizer's get_feature_names raise not NotFittedError when the vocabulary parameter is provided
If you initialize a `CounterVectorizer` and try to perform a transformation without training you will get a `NotFittedError` exception.

```python
In [1]: from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
In [2]: vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
In [3]: corpus = [
    ...:     'This is the first document.',
    ...:     'This is the second second document.',
    ...:     'And the third one.',
    ...:     'Is this the first document?',
    ...: ]

In [4]: vectorizer.transform(corpus)
NotFittedError: CountVectorizer - Vocabulary wasn't fitted.
```
On the other hand if you provide the `vocabulary` at the initialization of the vectorizer you could transform a corpus without a prior training, right?

```python
In [1]: from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

In [2]: vectorizer = CountVectorizer()

In [3]: corpus = [
    ...:     'This is the first document.',
    ...:     'This is the second second document.',
    ...:     'And the third one.',
    ...:     'Is this the first document?',
    ...: ]

In [4]: vocabulary = ['and', 'document', 'first', 'is', 'one', 'second', 'the', 'third', 'this']

In [5]: vectorizer = CountVectorizer(vocabulary=vocabulary)

In [6]: hasattr(vectorizer, "vocabulary_")
Out[6]: False

In [7]: vectorizer.get_feature_names()
NotFittedError: CountVectorizer - Vocabulary wasn't fitted.

In [8]: vectorizer.transform(corpus)
Out[8]:
<4x9 sparse matrix of type '<class 'numpy.int64'>'
        with 19 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Row format>

In [9]: hasattr(vectorizer, "vocabulary_")
Out[9]: True
```

The `CountVectorizer`'s `transform` calls `_validate_vocabulary` method which sets the `vocabulary_` instance variable.

In the same manner I believe that the `get_feature_names` method should not raise `NotFittedError` if the vocabulary parameter is provided but the vectorizer has not been trained.

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
## REPRODUCE TEST
```
import traceback
import sys
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    corpus = [
        'This is the first document.',
        'This is the second second document.',
        'And the third one.',
        'Is this the first document?',
    ]
    vocabulary = ['and', 'document', 'first', 'is', 'one', 'second', 'the', 'third', 'this']
    
    vectorizer = CountVectorizer(vocabulary=vocabulary)
    
    try:
        # This should not raise an error as per the expectation, but it does
        feature_names = vectorizer.get_feature_names()
        print("Feature names:", feature_names)
        # If the above line does not raise an error, the issue is fixed
        print("The issue is fixed.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "get_feature_names() raised an exception when it should not have"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

And this is the original output when running the test (before applying the patch):

The repair agent has tried to generate a patch to fix the issue:
## PATCH CONTEXT
<PATCH_CONTEXT>
To resolve the issue with the `get_feature_names` method in `CountVectorizer` class, I will update the method to prevent it from raising a `NotFittedError` when the vocabulary is provided directly. Here is the change that needs to be made:

```python
### sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def get_feature_names(self):
        """Array mapping from feature integer indices to feature name"""
        self._check_vocabulary()

        return [t for t, i in sorted(six.iteritems(self.vocabulary_),
                                     key=itemgetter(1))]
=======
    def get_feature_names(self):
        """Array mapping from feature integer indices to feature name"""
        # Ensure vocabulary_ is set, either by fitting or by providing a fixed vocabulary
        if not hasattr(self, 'vocabulary_'):
            self._validate_vocabulary()
            if not hasattr(self, 'vocabulary_'):
                raise NotFittedError("Vocabulary isn't set. Did you fit the model?")
        
        return [t for t, i in sorted(six.iteritems(self.vocabulary_),
                                     key=itemgetter(1))]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change will check if `vocabulary_` is not set and try to validate the vocabulary, allowing `get_feature_names` to proceed without raising an error if `vocabulary` is provided during initialization. Let's format this into the JSON format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    def get_feature_names(self):\n        \"\"\"Array mapping from feature integer indices to feature name\"\"\"\n        self._check_vocabulary()\n\n        return [t for t, i in sorted(six.iteritems(self.vocabulary_),\n                                     key=itemgetter(1))]\n=======\n    def get_feature_names(self):\n        \"\"\"Array mapping from feature integer indices to feature name\"\"\"\n        # Ensure vocabulary_ is set, either by fitting or by providing a fixed vocabulary\n        if not hasattr(self, 'vocabulary_'):\n            self._validate_vocabulary()\n            if not hasattr(self, 'vocabulary_'):\n                raise NotFittedError(\"Vocabulary isn't set. Did you fit the model?\")\n        \n        return [t for t, i in sorted(six.iteritems(self.vocabulary_),\n                                     key=itemgetter(1))]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE"
  ]
}
```
</PATCH_CONTEXT>

After applying the patch, the output of the test is:
## PATCHED OUTPUT
```
Feature names: ['and', 'document', 'first', 'is', 'one', 'second', 'the', 'third', 'this']
The issue is fixed.

```

Now, please first review the patch and analyse the test output before and after the patch, to determine whether the issue is fixed or not.

And finally, tell me whether the issue is fixed or not by replying with:
Issue resolved: `True/False`

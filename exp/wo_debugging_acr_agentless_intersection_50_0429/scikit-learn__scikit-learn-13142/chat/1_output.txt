To resolve the issue, we need to inspect the `GaussianMixture` class and specifically the `fit_predict` and `predict` methods. This investigation will help us identify any discrepancies or potential fixes for the issue with `n_init > 1`.

First, let's locate the `GaussianMixture` class and its methods in the scikit-learn codebase. We'll search for the class and the methods to understand their implementations.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("GaussianMixture")
search_method_in_codebase("GaussianMixture.fit_predict")
search_method_in_codebase("GaussianMixture.predict")
```

Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **sympy** project:

sqrtdenest raises IndexError

If an expression cannot be denested it should be returned unchanged.
IndexError fixed for sqrtdenest.
Fixes #12420 
Now if the expression can't be **denested**, it will be returned unchanged.
Old Result:
```

This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
The provided issue describes an `IndexError` being raised when the `sqrtdenest` function is invoked with a specific expression. The traceback indicates that the error occurs in the `_split_gcd` function within `sympy/simplify/radsimp.py`.

From the trace, here is what happens:

1. The main method defines an expression involving complex numbers and nested square roots.
2. The `sqrtdenest` method in `sympy/simplify/sqrtdenest.py` is called with this expression.
3. Inside `sqrtdenest`, `expand_mul(sympify(expr))` is executed, expanding and simplifying the expression.
4. The `expr` undergoes denesting attempts using `_sqrtdenest0`, which calls `_sqrtdenest1`.
5. The `_sqrt_match` function in `sympy/simplify/sqrtdenest.py` calls `split_surds`.
6. The `split_surds` function calls `_split_gcd`, and `IndexError: tuple index out of range` is raised when `g = a[0]` is attempted because `a` is empty.

The function `_split_gcd` encounters a situation where the input is not as expected, either because it is improperly handling cases where no GCD is found, or the original input to `split_surds` is leading to this scenario.

Given this reasoning, the error seems to stem from `_split_gcd`. We need to review the behavior in this function to ensure it handles the case where `a` might be empty.

Therefore, the next step is to trace the behavior of `_split_gcd` to examine why `a` is empty at this point.

Observed method: `sympy/simplify/radsimp.py:_split_gcd`
==================================================
Analyzing the provided code for the `_split_gcd` function and the runtime information:

The core idea behind `_split_gcd` is to divide a list of integers `a` into two lists: `a1`, which has a common divisor `g`, and `a2`, whose elements are not divisible by `g`. 

However, from the traceback, it is clear that the `IndexError` occurs because `a[0]` is accessed without checking if `a` is non-empty. This could happen if `_split_gcd` is called with an empty list of integers, leading directly to an `IndexError`.

The next logical step is to check why `_split_gcd` is being called with an empty list. This usually stems from the upstream processing or assumptions within `split_surds` or other related functions. Therefore, understanding the invocation and arguments passed to `_split_gcd` would be crucial.

Given this reasoning, the immediate scope to understand would involve how `_split_gcd` is invoked, particularly focusing on the conditions under which it is called. This likely involves `split_surds` where `_split_gcd` is used.

Therefore, I will need to trace the code from the point where `_split_gcd` is invoked with prepared arguments indicating abnormal behavior. For a deeper understanding, the line range in `radsimp.py` related to the invocation and argument preparation would be pertinent.

Observed scope: `sympy/simplify/radsimp.py:1032-1068`
==================================================
Analyzing the current context:

### Code Analysis

From the `_split_gcd` code snippet, we have a series of utility functions managing numerator and denominator expansion and handling fractions. The focus is on the `split_surds` function.

```python
def split_surds(expr):
    split an expression with terms whose squares are rationals into a sum of terms whose surds squared have gcd equal to g and a sum of terms with surds squared prime with g
```

The `split_surds` function is expected to process expressions and segregate terms based on common divisors of their square terms. The code indicates its reliance on the output of `_split_gcd`, making its behavior dependent on the logic and handling within this method.

In `_split_gcd`, an empty list for `a` will cause an `IndexError` when accessed, specifically at `g = a[0]`, if no proper checks are put in place. Since it is called within `split_surds`, there might be scenarios where the conditions or data preparation before calling `_split_gcd` does not account for all instances, especially when there's no common divisor.

### Runtime Information
The traceback and `AssertionError` seem unrelated, focusing instead on an incorrect setup in `run_debugging_test.py`. Its presence helps emphasize that `_split_gcd` must be robust to handle these cases without assumptions.

Given these points, the issue could be within `split_surds`, specifically concerning the setup or calls to `_split_gcd`.

### Next Steps
While the bug might be within `split_surds`, further understanding requires precision on how it constructs or manipulates data before calling `_split_gcd` and under what circumstances empty data emerges.

Therefore, the next logical step is to observe the complete behavior within `split_surds`, especially scanning its interaction leading to `_split_gcd`.

Observed method: `sympy/simplify/radsimp.py:split_surds`
==================================================
Analyzing the `split_surds` method:

### Code Analysis
The code is designed to decompose an expression into surds (square roots) categorized by a greatest common divisor (gcd). Here's a breakdown:

1. **Initial Setup**: It sorts the arguments of the expression and arranges them in a form (`coeff_muls`) that separates coefficients from surds.
2. **Surds Extraction**: It collects the square of the surds for gcd determination.
3. **GCD Split**: `_split_gcd` is invoked with these squares, segregating surds into `b1` (with a common factor `g`) and `b2` (without `g`).
4. **Refactor**: If `b2` is empty, and `b1` has enough elements, it attempts a further split on `b1` elements divided by `g`.
5. **Surds Classification**: Terms are classified into two lists (`a1v` and `a2v`) based on whether their surds belong to `b1` or not, using the adjusted gcd `g2`.
6. **Final Result**: A tuple containing the final GCD, a sum of factors from `a1v`, and `a2v` is returned.

### Issue Analysis
The problem arises due to improper handling when trying to split the surds based on gcd. If `_split_gcd` ends up with empty results initially, further splits attempt without valid data lead to `IndexError`.

From the runtime trace, and the assertion issue, we must ensure `_split_gcd` and its caller can handle scenarios where input leads to empty divisions, which implies enhancing `split_surds` and `_split_gcd` robustness against empty inputs.

### Next Steps
The focus should be on how `_split_gcd` processes inputs from `split_surds` and implicitly verifies for non-empty data before proceeding. An improvement might necessitate validation or conditional handling in `split_surds`.

Since the bug lies with data expectations leading to errors in `_split_gcd`, and there seem to be no upstream data preparation issues leading directly here, the next step involves examining whether any preliminary checks are missing in the needy segment where `g = a[0]` is attempted without confirming if `a` holds valid data.

I will further explore how the inputs are handled during the call to `_split_gcd`. It's prudent to observe the overall interactions leading up to that point and ensure that `_split_gcd` is resilient to empty inputs.

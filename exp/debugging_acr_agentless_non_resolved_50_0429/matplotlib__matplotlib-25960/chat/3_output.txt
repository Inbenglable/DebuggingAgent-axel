I need to check the `GridSpec` class in order to understand how `wspace` and `hspace` are supposed to be applied and why they might not be having the desired effect in the `subfigures` method. This will help me ensure that these parameters are correctly integrated for subfigure layout management.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("GridSpec")
```

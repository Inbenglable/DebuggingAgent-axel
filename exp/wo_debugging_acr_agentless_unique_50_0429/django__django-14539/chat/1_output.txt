To address the issue with the `urlize` function not handling HTML escaped strings and trailing punctuation correctly, I need to investigate how the `urlize` function is implemented. I will search for the `urlize` method in the codebase to understand its current behavior and make the necessary adjustments.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("urlize")
```

To resolve the issue with incorrect parenthesizing in LaTeX printing of the `Subs` object, we need to identify the part of the codebase responsible for converting `Subs` expressions to LaTeX format. This is likely handled within a printing module or specific method responsible for LaTeX conversion. 

The relevant class here is `Subs`, and we'll need to find the method that deals with its LaTeX representation. Commonly, Sympy uses specialized printing classes like `LatexPrinter`, which might contain methods like `_print_Subs` or similar methods for LaTeX formatting.

Hence, I will search for either the `Subs` class and relevant printing methods or for specific code related to the LaTeX conversion of `Subs`.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Subs")
search_method_in_codebase("_print_Subs")
search_method_in_codebase("_print_Latex")
search_class_in_codebase("LatexPrinter")
```

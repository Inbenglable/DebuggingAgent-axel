To resolve the issue in your Django project, I have determined a patch format that will address the use of `SimpleLazyObject` in the `OfferView.get_context_data` method. This involves converting `offer_slug` to a string explicitly to ensure compatibility with Django 3.1. Below is the `SEARCH/REPLACE` patch necessary to fix the issue:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### reproduce.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        offer_slug = kwargs.get(\"offer_slug\", \"\")\n=======\n        offer_slug = str(kwargs.get(\"offer_slug\", \"\"))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

Please apply the above patch to ensure that `offer_slug` is a string when used, resolving any type conflicts introduced by `SimpleLazyObject` in Django 3.1.

The observed abnormal program behavior indicates an issue with the way separability matrices are combined for nested compound models. In particular, the `_cstack` function is used to concatenate the separability matrices (`sepleft` and `sepright`) in the `_separable` function based on the operator of the compound model.

Here's the key observation from the trace:

1. For a simple compound model, `_cstack` correctly combines the separability matrices.
2. For a nested compound model, the resulting separability matrix indicates non-separability where separability was expected (e.g., both `[True, True]` instead of `[False, False]`).

From the trace, the `_cstack` function is involved in this erroneous combination process. The function `_cstack` stacks the separability matrices of the left and right parts of a compound model, and it seems to be creating a matrix that implies non-separability. Therefore, it seems that the way `_cstack` is constructing the combined matrix for nested compound models is incorrect.

Based on this analysis, the bug seems to be in the logic of `_cstack`.

Based on the issue description, it is clear that the problem is within the internal `_image()` function inside `homomorphisms.py` where it handles the case of a `PermutationGroup`. To fix the bug, it's essential to retrieve the source code of the `_image()` function, as this is where the current problem lies.

Therefore, I need to search for the `_image()` method in the `sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py", "_image")
```

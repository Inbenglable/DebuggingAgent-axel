The issue described is about the incorrect signature of manager methods due to incomplete metadata copying when decorating methods in Django model managers. The suggested fix is to use `functools.wraps` which copies all the necessary metadata.

To confirm the exact location and understand the surrounding code before generating the patch, I need to retrieve the relevant source code.

I will specifically look into the `django/db/models/manager.py` file to inspect the related code mentioned in the description.

```python
search_code_in_file("django/db/models/manager.py", "https://github.com/django/django/blob/fe2e1478464846638082219c933a4302e5cf3037/django/db/models/manager.py#L84")
```

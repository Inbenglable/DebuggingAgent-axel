The issue seems to arise from the `LogCaptureFixture._finalize` method failing to restore the log level for the `caplog.handler`. While it restores levels for loggers in `_initial_logger_levels`, it doesn't handle `caplog.handler` level restoration.

I need to retrieve the source code of `LogCaptureFixture.set_level` method, since it appears to be involved with changing log levels and should provide insight on how to store the original level for `caplog.handler`. This information will be used to amend `_finalize` to restore the `caplog.handler` level.

```python
search_method_in_file("src/_pytest/logging.py", "LogCaptureFixture.set_level")
```

To resolve the issue with the import ordering in Django migration files, we're primarily concerned with parts of the codebase responsible for writing migration files. From the API results, we need to identify files focusing on migrations, especially those related to writing or formatting migration files. The most promising lead is anything related to `MigrationWriter` as it likely deals with how migrations are written to files.

After examining the API results, the following file is relevant to our interest:

1. `tests/migrations/test_writer.py:924-930` - This is the most direct reference in the test suite to potentially check the output of migration-related code. 
   
Given this analysis, only the file below should be relevant for further investigation or modification to handle the import sorting issue:

```
tests/migrations/test_writer.py:924-930
```

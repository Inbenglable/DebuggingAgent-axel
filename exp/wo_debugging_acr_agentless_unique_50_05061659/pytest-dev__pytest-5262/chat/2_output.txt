To fix the issue, I need to understand the contents of the `__init__` method to determine how the `mode` attribute is set or handled. This will help in identifying how to ensure that the mode does not include 'b'. 

Let's retrieve the `__init__` method from the `EncodedFile` class in the `src/_pytest/capture.py` file.
```python
search_method_in_file("src/_pytest/capture.py", "EncodedFile.__init__")
```

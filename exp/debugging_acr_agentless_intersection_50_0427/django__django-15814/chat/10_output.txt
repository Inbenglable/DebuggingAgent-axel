Given the insights from the analysis, it is apparent that constructing `self.init_list` correctly for proxy models is the root of the issue. To devise a proper patch, it would be essential to have the source code for the `RelatedPopulator.__init__` method, particularly focusing on how fields are retrieved and indexed for proxy models.

Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code for the `RelatedPopulator.__init__` method to ensure the modification adequately addresses handling of proxy models in Django's query preparation.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/query.py", "RelatedPopulator.__init__")
```

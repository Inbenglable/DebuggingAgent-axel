I'm ready to generate the patch. By analyzing the code for the `prepare_request` method, I can see that headers are merged from both the `Request` instance and the `Session` instance using `merge_setting`. To fix the issue, we should modify this step to exclude headers that have `None` as their value, ensuring they aren't sent with a request.

Ready generation: `True`

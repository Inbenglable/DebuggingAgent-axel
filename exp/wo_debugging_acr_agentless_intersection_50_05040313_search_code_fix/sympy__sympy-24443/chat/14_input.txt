You are a PR reviewer that needs to review the patch generated by a bug repair agent and determine whether the issue is fixed or not.
This is the bug issue, which is in the **sympy** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
`_check_homomorphism` is broken on PermutationGroups
```python
In [1]: from sympy.combinatorics import *
   ...: from sympy.combinatorics.homomorphisms import homomorphism
   ...: D3 = DihedralGroup(3)
   ...: T = homomorphism(D3, D3, D3.generators, D3.generators)

ValueError: The given images do not define a homomorphism
```

The issue is in the internal `_image()` function, where it handles the case of a `PermutationGroup`:

https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/809c53c077485ca48a206cee78340389cb83b7f1/sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py#L336-L337

When `r[i]` is an inverted generator, the `in gens` test fails.

I think the whole thing can be greatly simplified.

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
## REPRODUCE TEST
```
# reproducer.py

from sympy.combinatorics import DihedralGroup
from sympy.combinatorics.homomorphisms import homomorphism
import traceback
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        D3 = DihedralGroup(3)
        T = homomorphism(D3, D3, D3.generators, D3.generators)
        # If no exception is raised, the issue might be fixed
        print("No exception raised, the issue might be fixed.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except ValueError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The given images do not define a homomorphism")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

And this is the original output when running the test (before applying the patch):
## ORIGINAL OUTPUT

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

```

The repair agent has tried to generate a patch to fix the issue:
## PATCH CONTEXT
<PATCH_CONTEXT>
Based on the issue description and the retrieved `_check_homomorphism` method, the problem is specifically within the `_image()` function. When dealing with `PermutationGroup`, the function needs to correctly handle inverted generators within `r`. The current logic checks for `r[i] in gens`, which fails when `r[i]` is an inverted generator (`s**-1`). The whole logic can be simplified by directly using the generator images if they exist for both `s` and its inverse `s**-1`.

Here's the proposed patch to simplify and fix the logic:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                if isinstance(domain, PermutationGroup) and r[i] in gens:\n                    s = domain.generators[gens.index(r[i])]\n                else:\n                    s = r[i]\n                if s in images:\n                    w = w*images[s]**power\n                elif s**-1 in images:\n                    w = w*images[s**-1]**power\n=======\n                s = r[i]\n                if s in images:\n                    w = w*images[s]**power\n                elif s**-1 in images:\n                    w = w*images[s**-1]**power\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

With this patch, it removes the unnecessary steps and makes use of `images[s]` directly or its inverse `images[s**-1]`, without needing to determine whether `r[i]` is technically from `gens`. It streamlines handling both normal and inverted generators and fixes the homomorphism check logic.
</PATCH_CONTEXT>

After applying the patch, the output of the test is:
## PATCHED OUTPUT
```
No exception raised, the issue might be fixed.

```

Now, please first review the patch and analyse the test output before and after the patch, to determine whether the issue is fixed or not.

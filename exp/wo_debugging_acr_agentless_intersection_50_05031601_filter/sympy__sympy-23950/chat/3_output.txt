Based on the information provided, we now know the location of the `Contains` class and its `as_set` method in the `sympy/sets/contains.py` file. However, the method `as_set` is currently not implemented and raises a `NotImplementedError`. To generate the patch, we need to decide on a suitable implementation for `as_set`.

Before generating the patch, it would be beneficial to examine similar methods in other classes to understand how `as_set` might be implemented to return a set. For this, we can explore how other set-related classes handle `as_set` conversions.

Let's proceed to search for `as_set` implementations in other relevant classes within the sympy codebase to understand how such methods are conventionally implemented.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("as_set")
```

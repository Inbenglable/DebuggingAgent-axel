To resolve the issue, I need to examine the `write` method in the `HTML` class within the `astropy/io/ascii/html.py` file. This is necessary to understand how it handles the `formats` argument and make sure it applies the formatting correctly in the HTML output. Therefore, I will retrieve the source code for the `HTML.write` method.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/io/ascii/html.py", "HTML.write")
```

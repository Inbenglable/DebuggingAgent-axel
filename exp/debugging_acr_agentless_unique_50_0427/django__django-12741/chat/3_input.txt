You need to trace the abnormal program to resolve project issues and submit pull requests.
Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Simplify signature of `DatabaseOperations.execute_sql_flush()`
Description
	
The current signature is:
def execute_sql_flush(self, using, sql_list):
The using argument can be dropped and inferred by the calling instance: self.connection.alias.
def execute_sql_flush(self, sql_list):
Some internal ises of this method are already doing:
connection.ops.execute_sql_flush(connection.alias, sql_flush)

</ISSUE>


Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import connection
from django.db.backends.sqlite3.base import DatabaseWrapper

# Configure minimal settings
settings.configure(
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': ':memory:',
        }
    }
)

# Create a test table and insert some data
with connection.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute("CREATE TABLE test_table (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);")
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO test_table (name) VALUES ('test1'), ('test2');")

# Verify data exists
with connection.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM test_table;")
    count_before = cursor.fetchone()[0]
    print(f"Records before flush: {count_before}")

# Test the new method signature
sql_list = ["DELETE FROM test_table;"]
connection.ops.execute_sql_flush(sql_list)

# Verify data was deleted
with connection.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM test_table;")
    count_after = cursor.fetchone()[0]
    print(f"Records after flush: {count_after}")

print("Test completed successfully!")


This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
Analyzing the provided test code and error output, the test is designed to verify the behavior of a `DatabaseOperations` method called `execute_sql_flush`. The test attempts to call this method with a single argument, `sql_list`. However, it results in a `TypeError` indicating that the method is missing a required positional argument, `'sql_list'`.

The issue description suggests that the current method signature includes an unnecessary `using` argument, which should be eliminated from the signature and its usage inferred from `self.connection.alias`.

From this information, we need to look at the implementation of the `execute_sql_flush` method to understand why the test input does not match the existing method signature and determine where the change must be made.

Therefore, we need to locate and observe the `execute_sql_flush` method within the `DatabaseOperations` class. This method should be inside a file that handles database operations for a specific backend in Django. 

Observed method: `django/db/backends/base/operations.py:DatabaseOperations.execute_sql_flush`
==================================================


Now you choose downstream method BaseDatabaseOperations.execute_sql_flush to further observe, tracing the abnormal program behavior.
This is the method code:
   403	    def execute_sql_flush(self, using, sql_list):
   404	        """Execute a list of SQL statements to flush the database."""
   405	        with transaction.atomic(using=using, savepoint=self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl):
   406	            with self.connection.cursor() as cursor:
   407	                for sql in sql_list:
   408	                    cursor.execute(sql)


This is the runtime information of BaseDatabaseOperations.execute_sql_flush:

You need to trace the abnormal program behavior step by step to identify the root cause of the bug and locate the buggy method that contains the code to be fixed.
Now, please first analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior. 

Then, if you can already locate the buggy method and buggy code, reply with:  
Buggy method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Otherwise, continue tracing by telling me the code line scope that you want to deeper observe, we will show you the deeper downstream run-time information of the scope you select. Please reply with:
Observed scope: `{FILE_PATH}:{START_LOC}-{END_LOC}`
Note that {FILE_PATH} refers to the path relative to the repository.

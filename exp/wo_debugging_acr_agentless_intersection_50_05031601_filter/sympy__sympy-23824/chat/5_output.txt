To resolve the issue with the `kahane_simplify()` function, the leading gamma matrices are being reversed due to the backward insertion loop at the end of the function. The patch will correct this behavior by adjusting the loop which inserts these leading matrices. 

Here's the patch in *SEARCH/REPLACE* format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/physics/hep/gamma_matrices.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    for i in range(0, first_dum_pos):\n        [ri.insert(0, free_pos[i]) for ri in resulting_indices]\n=======\n    for i in range(first_dum_pos - 1, -1, -1):\n        [ri.insert(0, free_pos[i]) for ri in resulting_indices]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation
- The loop `for i in range(0, first_dum_pos):` iterated in increasing order and inserted elements at the beginning of each list in `resulting_indices`, thereby reversing the order.
- The suggested replacement iterates in reverse by using `range(first_dum_pos - 1, -1, -1)`, which correctly maintains the order of the leading gamma matrices in the resulting expression.

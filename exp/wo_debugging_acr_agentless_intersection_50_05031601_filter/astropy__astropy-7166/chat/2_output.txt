To resolve the issue, I need to update the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass implementation to accommodate docstrings for properties. This likely involves modifying how the metaclass checks for functions and properties, possibly leveraging `inspect.isfunction`, `inspect.ismethod`, or `inspect.isdatadescriptor`. To proceed, I need to retrieve the complete source code for the `InheritDocstrings` class, specifically its `__init__` method, to make the necessary modifications.

```python
search_class_in_file("astropy/utils/misc.py", "InheritDocstrings")
```

I have retrieved the `ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members` method's implementation, which handles member inclusion based on the `__all__` attribute. Here is the plan to fix the issue:

1. Add a check to handle the case where `__all__` is explicitly set and is empty.
2. Modify the logic to ensure no members are included if `__all__` is empty.

Given the source code retrieved, I am ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

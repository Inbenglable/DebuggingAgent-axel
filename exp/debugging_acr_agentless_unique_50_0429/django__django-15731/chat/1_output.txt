The error message indicates that the Django settings have not been properly configured before attempting to use models, leading to the `django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured` exception. The specific issue occurs when trying to create the `Person` model, and the Django settings have not been set up at this point.

Here's a breakdown of the code execution leading to the error:

1. The `setup_django()` function is defined, which is supposed to configure the Django settings including `INSTALLED_APPS` and `DATABASES`.

2. The `main()` function attempts to inspect the signature of `Person.objects.bulk_create`, but this relies on the `Person` model being instantiated successfully.

3. The error occurs because the settings have not been configured before the declaration of the `Person` model class, and the Django model system checks the app configuration during the creation of model classes.

4. The stack trace shows that the error emerges when it tries to access settings through `self.check_apps_ready()`, indicating that the Django apps configuration hasn't been completed.

To resolve this error within the test script, you need to ensure `setup_django()` is called before any Django model class is defined or instantiated. This way, Django settings will be configured properly before the model tries to access them.

Before locating the buggy method related to the original issue in the Django manager code, we need to fix the test script setup first.

Observed method: `reproduce.py:setup_django`

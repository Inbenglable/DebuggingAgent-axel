To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code of the `check_constraints` method located in the `python3.7/site-packages/django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py` file. This will allow me to properly understand how the method executes SQL statements, so I can generate a patch to quote table names correctly.

```python
search_method_in_file("python3.7/site-packages/django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py", "check_constraints")
```

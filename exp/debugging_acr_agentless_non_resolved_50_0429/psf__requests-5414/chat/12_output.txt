Here are the necessary modifications to resolve the issue by catching `LocationParseError` and throwing an `InvalidURL` exception.

```pythony
### requests/adapters.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        except LocationValueError as e:
=======
        except (LocationValueError, LocationParseError) as e:
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### requests/adapters.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        except LocationValueError as e:\n=======\n        except (LocationValueError, LocationParseError) as e:\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

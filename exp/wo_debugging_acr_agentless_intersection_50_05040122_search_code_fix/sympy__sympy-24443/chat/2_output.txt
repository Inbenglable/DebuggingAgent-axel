The issue appears to stem from how the `_image()` function is handling permutations, particularly when dealing with inverted generators. The code snippet provided outlines the `_check_homomorphism` function, which includes the `_image()` function internally. This gives us the necessary insight into the current logic and potential areas for simplifying and fixing the method where inverted generators are causing test failures.

I have gathered sufficient context on the implementation to proceed with generating a patch that addresses this permutation-related handling within `_image()`. 

Hence, I am ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

I need to inspect the implementation of the `_arithmetic` method since it is crucial for understanding how mask propagation and operations are handled during arithmetic operations in the `NDDataRef` class. The `_prepare_then_do_arithmetic` method calls `_arithmetic` to perform the main arithmetic operations, and the problem likely originates from this part of the code.

I'll proceed to retrieve the source code for `_arithmetic`, which is likely in the same file as `_prepare_then_do_arithmetic`.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py", "_arithmetic")
```

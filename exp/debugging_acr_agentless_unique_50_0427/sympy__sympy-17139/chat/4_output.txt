To resolve the issue, the problem is that the condition `rv.exp < 0` is incorrectly comparing complex numbers, which causes a `TypeError`. In the `_TR56` function, we need to handle complex exponents appropriately, by first checking if the exponent is complex using the `is_complex` property or directly using `is_number` and `is_complex`.

I have gathered the source code for the `_TR56` function, which is sufficient to generate the patch to handle this case correctly.

Ready generation: `True`

To address the bug identified in the `RelatedPopulator.__init__` method within the `django/db/models/query.py` file, I need to retrieve the source code for this method to understand its current implementation and make necessary adjustments for handling proxy model fields correctly.

I will use the `search_method_in_file` API to locate and retrieve the source code for the method `RelatedPopulator.__init__`.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/query.py", "RelatedPopulator.__init__")
```

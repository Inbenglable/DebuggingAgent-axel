Let's first evaluate the patch and examine the test output:

### Evaluation of the Patch:
The patch modifies the `__getattr__` method in the `src/_pytest/capture.py` file. Specifically, it introduces a conditional check for the `mode` attribute, replacing the `b` character in the mode string returned by the `buffer`. This modification aligns with the issue description where `_pytest.capture.EncodedFile` should not advertise binary mode (`rb+`) for the captured output.

### Test Output Analysis:
#### Original Output:
Before the patch, the test resulted in a `ModuleNotFoundError` indicating that the `youtube_dl` module was not installed in the environment where the test was run. The error does not provide information about whether the patch addresses the original issue reported.

#### Patched Output:
The patched output also shows the same `ModuleNotFoundError`, which suggests that the environment setup for running the test has not changed, and the test has not progressed to evaluating whether the patch fixes the problem regarding the `mode` attribute of `_pytest.capture.EncodedFile`.

### Conclusion:
Since the test does not run due to the missing `youtube_dl` module, neither the original nor the patched output can verify if the patch resolves the issue. The patch itself appears to address the original issue based on its description, but without a successful test run, the actual functionality cannot be confirmed.

Issue resolved: `False`

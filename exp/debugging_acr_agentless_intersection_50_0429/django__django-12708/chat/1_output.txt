The issue appears to be related to how Django's migration framework processes the deletion of a combination of constraints (`index_together` and `unique_together`) on model fields. The error occurs due to the migration framework finding an unexpected number of constraints when attempting to delete the `index_together`.

The error traceback indicates that the relevant method involved in handling this error is `_delete_composed_index` in the `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` file. This method is responsible for deleting indices defined on model fields, and it encounters a `ValueError` when the actual number of constraints does not match the expected number.

Let's delve into the observed method where this behavior occurs:

Observed method: `django/db/backends/base/schema.py:_delete_composed_index`

The issue with the `floatformat()` function seems to be related to the way it handles precision for certain decimal values. The error indicates that the precision range might be incorrectly calculated, leading to a ValueError. 

I have the complete source code of the `floatformat()` function, and I can see the lines where it might be calculating the precision based on the `prec` variable. The crucial parts seem to be around the calculation of `m` and `prec`.

Given that I have the necessary source code, I can proceed to generate a patch to fix the precision calculation issue.

Ready generation: `True`

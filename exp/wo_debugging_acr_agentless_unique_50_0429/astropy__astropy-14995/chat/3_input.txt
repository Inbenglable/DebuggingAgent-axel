<ISSUE>
In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask
### Description

This applies to v5.3. 

It looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.

I don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.

### Expected behavior

When one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.

### How to Reproduce

This is with v5.3.   With v5.2, there are no errors.

```
>>> import numpy as np
>>> from astropy.nddata import NDDataRef

>>> array = np.array([[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]])
>>> mask = np.array([[0, 1, 64], [8, 0, 1], [2, 1, 0]])

>>> nref_nomask = NDDataRef(array)
>>> nref_mask = NDDataRef(array, mask=mask)

# multiply no mask by constant (no mask * no mask)
>>> nref_nomask.multiply(1., handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask   # returns nothing, no mask,  OK

# multiply no mask by itself (no mask * no mask)
>>> nref_nomask.multiply(nref_nomask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask # return nothing, no mask, OK

# multiply mask by constant (mask * no mask)
>>> nref_mask.multiply(1., handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask
...
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'

# multiply mask by itself (mask * mask)
>>> nref_mask.multiply(nref_mask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask
array([[ 0,  1, 64],
       [ 8,  0,  1],
       [ 2,  1,  0]])

# multiply mask by no mask (mask * no mask)
>>> nref_mask.multiply(nref_nomask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask
...
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'
```

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To fix this issue, I need to examine the code responsible for mask propagation in the `NDDataRef` class, specifically focusing on the handling of masks during operations such as multiplication. I will search for the `multiply` method and the `NDDataRef` class in the codebase to understand how mask propagation is currently being handled.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("NDDataRef")
search_method_in_codebase("NDDataRef.multiply")
```

#### astropy/nddata/nddata_withmixins.py:NDDataRef
```python
class NDDataRef(NDArithmeticMixin, NDIOMixin, NDSlicingMixin, NDData):
    """Implements `NDData` with all Mixins.

    This class implements a `NDData`-like container that supports reading and
    writing as implemented in the ``astropy.io.registry`` and also slicing
    (indexing) and simple arithmetic (add, subtract, divide and multiply).

    Notes
    -----
    A key distinction from `NDDataArray` is that this class does not attempt
    to provide anything that was not defined in any of the parent classes.

    See Also
    --------
    NDData
    NDArithmeticMixin
    NDSlicingMixin
    NDIOMixin

    Examples
    --------
    The mixins allow operation that are not possible with `NDData` or
    `NDDataBase`, i.e. simple arithmetic::

        >>> from astropy.nddata import NDDataRef, StdDevUncertainty
        >>> import numpy as np

        >>> data = np.ones((3,3), dtype=float)
        >>> ndd1 = NDDataRef(data, uncertainty=StdDevUncertainty(data))
        >>> ndd2 = NDDataRef(data, uncertainty=StdDevUncertainty(data))

        >>> ndd3 = ndd1.add(ndd2)
        >>> ndd3.data  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
        array([[2., 2., 2.],
               [2., 2., 2.],
               [2., 2., 2.]])
        >>> ndd3.uncertainty.array  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
        array([[1.41421356, 1.41421356, 1.41421356],
               [1.41421356, 1.41421356, 1.41421356],
               [1.41421356, 1.41421356, 1.41421356]])

    see `NDArithmeticMixin` for a complete list of all supported arithmetic
    operations.

    But also slicing (indexing) is possible::

        >>> ndd4 = ndd3[1,:]
        >>> ndd4.data  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
        array([2., 2., 2.])
        >>> ndd4.uncertainty.array  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
        array([1.41421356, 1.41421356, 1.41421356])

    See `NDSlicingMixin` for a description how slicing works (which attributes)
    are sliced.

==================================================

Your Output:
To resolve the issue, I need to examine the `_prepare_then_do_arithmetic` method, which is invoked by `NDArithmeticMixin.multiply`. Understanding how this method handles mask propagation during arithmetic operations is key to addressing the bug.

I'll search for the `_prepare_then_do_arithmetic` method in the `astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py` file to gather more details.

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

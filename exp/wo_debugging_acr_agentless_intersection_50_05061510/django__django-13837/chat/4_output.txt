Issue resolved: `False`

The patch introduces a syntax error due to the use of the Python 3.8-specific assignment expression (the walrus operator `:=`). If the environment running this code does not support this syntax, such an error will occur, as shown in the patched output. Therefore, the issue is not resolved because the provided solution fails to execute due to this syntax error. Without the execution proceeding past this point, it cannot be determined if the logic fix actually addresses the issue as intended.

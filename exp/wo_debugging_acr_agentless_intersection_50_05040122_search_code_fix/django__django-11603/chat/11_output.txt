To resolve the issue of adding DISTINCT support for the Avg and Sum aggregates in Django, we need to mimic the approach used in the Count aggregate, which allows for the DISTINCT option by setting `allow_distinct` to `True`. We'll apply similar changes to both the Avg and Sum classes.

Here is the patch to achieve this:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):\n=======\nclass Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):\n=======\nclass Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

These modifications will enable the DISTINCT option for Avg and Sum aggregates by setting the `allow_distinct` attribute to `True`, similar to what is done in the Count aggregate.

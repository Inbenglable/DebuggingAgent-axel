The test result indicates that the dtype preservation is not working as intended. The feature selection process using `SelectKBest` is converting the dtypes from the input data frame into `float64` for both `np.float16` and `category` types in the output data frame.

Starting from the `fit_transform` method in the `SelectKBest` class, we can trace the method calls that lead to the transformation of data and observe how dtypes are handled.

Since the issue centers around output transformation and dtype preservation, we need to examine the function `_wrap_data_with_container`, which appears in the call stack. This function is likely responsible for returning the transformed data wrapped in a pandas DataFrame and should contain logic for dtype preservation.

Observed method: `sklearn/utils/_set_output.py:_wrap_data_with_container`

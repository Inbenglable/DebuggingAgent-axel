### Patch Review

The issue was related to how the `trim_docstring` function handled docstrings starting with non-empty first lines. The patch applied to the code changes the logic to skip the first line when calculating the minimum indentation:

Original code:
```python
indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())
```

Patched code:
```python
indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())
```

### Test Output Analysis

- **Original Output:** The test fails with an `ImportError` indicating a missing import: `ImportError: cannot import name 'simplify_exception'`. This error occurs before any of the issue-specific logic is executed, meaning the test can't proceed to test the original issue.
  
- **Patched Output:** The same `ImportError` is present in the patched output.

This indicates that regardless of the patch applied to address the logic in `trim_docstring`, the test cannot verify the bug because of an unrelated import error (`simplify_exception`).

### Conclusion

The patch seems to address the logic error in `trim_docstring` by skipping the first line when calculating indentation. However, due to the import error present in both the original and patched outputs, it is impossible to determine if the patch resolves the issue without fixing this error first.

Thus, based solely on the current test outputs, the resolution of the issue cannot be verified.

Issue resolved: `False`

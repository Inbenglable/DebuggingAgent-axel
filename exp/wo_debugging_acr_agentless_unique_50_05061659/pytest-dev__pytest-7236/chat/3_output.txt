To identify the specific section within pytest that handles test skipping and teardown, especially when `--pdb` is enabled, I need to focus on how pytest manages the lifecycle of tests including the teardown stage. The API returned content gives two potential segments of code related to `pytest_runtest_teardown`. 

Analyzing the results:
- **src/_pytest/hookspec.py:pytest_runtest_teardown**: This file defines the `pytest_runtest_teardown` hook but does not provide the implementation details that might impact issues with the `--pdb` option. It is more about declaring the hook rather than detailing its execution.
  
- **src/_pytest/runner.py:pytest_runtest_teardown**: This file appears to contain the implementation of `pytest_runtest_teardown`, which is crucial because it manages the teardown logic during test execution. The method in this file includes handling the update of the current test state, which could directly impact the execution of `tearDown` in relation to the `--pdb` option.

Given the needs to focus on the actual implementation affecting the test lifecycle, particularly `tearDown`, the relevant content is:

```
src/_pytest/runner.py:pytest_runtest_teardown
```

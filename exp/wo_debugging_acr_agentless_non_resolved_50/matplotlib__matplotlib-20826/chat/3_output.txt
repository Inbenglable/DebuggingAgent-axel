To address the issue, we need to investigate the `cla` method in the `_AxesBase` class because the `clear` method in `_AxesBase` simply calls `self.cla()`. Since we already have the location of the `_AxesBase.clear` method, it makes sense to look into the `cla` method that it uses.

I will retrieve the source code of the `cla` method from the `_AxesBase` class to understand its behavior and how it might affect shared axes and tick labels.

```python
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py", "cla")
search_class_in_file("lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py", "_AxesBase")
```

To add DISTINCT support to the `Avg` and `Sum` aggregates, we need to modify their classes in the `django/db/models/aggregates.py` file, similar to how it is implemented for the `Count` class. Specifically, we need to add an `allow_distinct` attribute and set it to `True` for both classes. Let's prepare the necessary patches:

```pythony
### django/db/models/aggregates.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):
=======
class Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):
    allow_distinct = True
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```pythony
### django/db/models/aggregates.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):
=======
class Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):
    allow_distinct = True
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's present the search/replace edits in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):\n=======\nclass Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):\n=======\nclass Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

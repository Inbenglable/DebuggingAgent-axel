Based on the retrieved source code of the `method_decorator` function, we can see that the issue might lie in the way `_multi_decorate` is invoked and how it handles the preservation of function attributes when dealing with partial objects.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/utils/decorators.py", "_multi_decorate")

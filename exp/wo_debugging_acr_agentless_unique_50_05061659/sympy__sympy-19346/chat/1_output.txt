To resolve the issue with `srepr` not printing `dict` and `set` correctly, I need to understand the implementation of the `srepr` function in the SymPy library. Firstly, I need to locate and retrieve the source code of the `srepr` function to comprehend how it processes different data types and identify where modifications are necessary.

Therefore, I'll search for the `srepr` function in the SymPy codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("srepr")
```

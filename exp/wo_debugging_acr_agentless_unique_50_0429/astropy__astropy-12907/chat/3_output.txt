To properly address the issue, I need to delve further into the method `_coord_matrix` as it is involved in the `_separable` function which influences the behavior of `separability_matrix`. I'll search for this method in the `astropy/modeling/separable.py` file to understand its implementation.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/modeling/separable.py", "_coord_matrix")
```

To implement the `__iter__` method for the `Paginator` class, we have identified that the class is located in the `django/core/paginator.py` file. However, we have yet to retrieve the full source code of the `Paginator` class. To ensure a seamless integration of the new method, we need to retrieve the full source code for context.

I'll proceed to fetch the complete source code of the `Paginator` class.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/core/paginator.py", "Paginator")
```

To address the issue, I need to examine the source code for the `reduce` method in the `AlterField` class to ensure a proper understanding before generating the patch. This method is part of the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file, according to the debugging history.

Hence, I'll proceed to search for the `reduce` method within the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py", "AlterField.reduce")
```

To resolve the issue, I need to modify the `only_relation_agnostic_fields` method within the `MigrationAutodetector` class to safely handle the absence of the `to` key by using `pop` instead of `del`. 

Before generating the patch, I need to retrieve the source code of this method to ensure precise modification. Given the previous observations, I will search for the `only_relation_agnostic_fields` method in the `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/autodetector.py", "MigrationAutodetector.only_relation_agnostic_fields")
```

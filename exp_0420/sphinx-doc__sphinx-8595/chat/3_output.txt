The issue reported suggests that when the `__all__` attribute is empty, all members of the module are being included in the documentation. According to the intended behavior, if `__all__` is empty, no members should be included.

From the observations, it appears that the method `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:get_object_members` is responsible for retrieving members of a class for documentation. The specific class documenter method `ClassDocumenter.get_object_members` seems to be where the members are filtered based on options and conditions including the presence of an `__all__` attribute.

The method checks the `want_all` parameter and the `self.options.members` to determine which members to include. To identify whether this method correctly handles the empty `__all__` attribute, we need to further observe how the `want_all` flag and the `self.options` attributes are set and used.

We need to check the code section where `want_all` and `self.options.members` conditions are processed, as an empty `__all__` attribute should lead to no members being selected.


### Next Step:
We need to trace deeper into the conditional logic that processes member inclusion. Specifically, let's observe lines 1627-1638 to see how the `want_all` and `self.options.members` conditions are handled.

```python
Observed scope: sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:1627-1638
```

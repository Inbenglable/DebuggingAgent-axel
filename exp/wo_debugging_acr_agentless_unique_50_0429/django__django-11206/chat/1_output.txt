To address this issue, I need to inspect the `format` method in the `django.utils.numberformat` module. First, I will search for this method within the appropriate file to understand its current implementation.

Here are the actions I will take to retrieve the source code:

```python
search_method_in_codebase("format")
```

This will help me locate the file where the `format` method is defined so that I can analyze and eventually generate the patch.

To proceed with generating the patch, I need to ensure that I have all the necessary context of the `_sparse_fit` method around where the division by zero occurs, especially how `libsvm_sparse.libsvm_sparse_train` populates `self.support_vectors_`. Since `libsvm_sparse_train` is invoked within the `_sparse_fit` method, I hypothesize that understanding the output of this function or its docstring (if available) might help us implement a check for zero support vectors.

Since I have the implementation of `_sparse_fit` and some context about `libsvm_sparse_train`, I suspect there needs to be a condition to check for zero support vectors and handle that appropriately. I believe I am ready to generate the patch based on this information.

Ready generation: `True`

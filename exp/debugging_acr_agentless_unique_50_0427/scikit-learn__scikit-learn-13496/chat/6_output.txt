To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code for the `IsolationForest.__init__` method to ensure that `warm_start` is correctly included in the parameters and documented properly. This will allow me to understand exactly how the initialization is structured, and how to adapt it to expose the `warm_start` parameter while maintaining consistency with other similar classes.

Let's retrieve the necessary source code:

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/ensemble/_iforest.py", "IsolationForest.__init__")
```

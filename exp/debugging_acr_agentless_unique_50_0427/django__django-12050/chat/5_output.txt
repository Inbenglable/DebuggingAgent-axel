The method `Query.resolve_lookup_value` is responsible for resolving lookup values, and when handling lists and tuples, it appears to coerce the input list into a tuple at line 1076, `value = tuple(resolved_values)`. This coercion breaks exact value queries for ORM field types that depend on input types, such as `PickledField` from external libraries. The issue is being encountered when the input value is a list, which should remain as a list instead of being coerced to a tuple for consistency with the input type.

Given this understanding, the buggy code is located within the observed code, particularly the line:
```python
value = tuple(resolved_values)
```

This seems to be the core issue based on the description provided in the issue, but to ensure a thorough understanding, focusing on the downstream execution when resolving expressions may also provide additional context.

Since the issue concerns the transformation of list types to tuples within `Query.resolve_lookup_value`, further observation on the handling of list types just before this coercion occurs could be necessary.

However, given the clarity of the described issue and the observed code, it seems highly plausible that the line `value = tuple(resolved_values)` is where the bug manifests for lists.

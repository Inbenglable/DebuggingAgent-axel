To address the issue, I need to examine the current implementation of the `ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute()` and `FileInput.use_required_attribute()` methods in the Django codebase. This will help me understand how to adjust the logic to ensure the `required` attribute is not present when initial data exists. Since I have the file path for one of the methods, I'll search for both methods in the relevant file first.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute")
search_method_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "FileInput.use_required_attribute")
```

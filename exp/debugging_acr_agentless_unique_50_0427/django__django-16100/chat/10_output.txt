The current error message and method code provided lead us to analyze the initialization of the `UserSettingsHolder` class in Django. The key points from the piece of code and the traceback are:

1. **Code Context**:
   - The `UserSettingsHolder.__init__` method initializes the internal structures needed to manage settings sourced from a default settings module.
   - It creates a dictionary entry `_deleted` and stores the reference to `default_settings`.

2. **Traceback Summary**:
   - An `AssertionError` occurs during the execution of `run_debugging_test.py`. This suggests a failure when certain conditions are being asserted, specifically related to checking if a file path exists.
   - It seems the error is linked to a path or file assertion within the testing context, possibly related to the setup of the environment or files needed for the test execution.

3. **Abnormal Behavior**:
   - The main issue revealed by the traceback is not directly related to the `UserSettingsHolder.__init__` method but rather an `AssertionError` in the test script while verifying file paths.

Given this information, the core issue does not seem to lie within the `UserSettingsHolder.__init__` method itself but rather in the testing setup or execution environment which is potentially misconfigured. The `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` must be set correctly before any changes to settings or initialization happen.

However, before jumping to conclusions about which part might be faulty, it's important to verify step changes and follow the error context offered by:

- **Checking the setup**: Ensure `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is set before any models are accessed or any settings checked.
- **Reviewing the test script**: Ensure all environmental dependencies and file paths are appropriately set before the test is executed.

### Conclusion and Next Observation

To achieve more insightful diagnostics on where the setup might go wrong or what might be missing in the script, we should delve into areas of the code where Django environment setup checks occur.

Let's verify the settings environment setup and assertions by examining the initialization logic in `LazySettings`. Here is the next scope to observe:

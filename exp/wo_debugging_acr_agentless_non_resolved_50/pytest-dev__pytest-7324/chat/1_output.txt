To address this issue, I need to locate the specific section of code where `Expression.compile("False")` is invoked or handled in the pytest project. This typically involves searching for where expressions are compiled and any interaction with the Python debug build related assertions about boolean values like "False". Therefore, I will first search for the methods or classes related to expression compilation in the pytest codebase, so I can find the relevant code and understand how it's implemented.

Given the information from the issue, I will start by searching the codebase for any method or class related to `Expression.compile`.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("Expression.compile")
search_class_in_codebase("Expression")
```

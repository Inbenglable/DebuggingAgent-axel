## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Adding nullable OneToOneField crashes on SQLite.
Description
	
This new sqlite3 error has cropped up between building django-oauth-toolkit between Django 4.0 and main branch for migrations.AddField of a OneToOneField (see â€‹https://github.com/jazzband/django-oauth-toolkit/issues/1064):
self = <django.db.backends.sqlite3.base.SQLiteCursorWrapper object at 0x10b8038b0>
query = 'ALTER TABLE "oauth2_provider_accesstoken" ADD COLUMN "source_refresh_token_id" bigint NULL UNIQUE REFERENCES "oauth2_provider_refreshtoken" ("id") DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED'
params = []
	def execute(self, query, params=None):
		if params is None:
			return Database.Cursor.execute(self, query)
		query = self.convert_query(query)
>	 return Database.Cursor.execute(self, query, params)
E	 django.db.utils.OperationalError: Cannot add a UNIQUE column
Here's the relevant migration snippet: 
		migrations.AddField(
			model_name='AccessToken',
			name='source_refresh_token',
			field=models.OneToOneField(blank=True, null=True, on_delete=django.db.models.deletion.SET_NULL, to=oauth2_settings.REFRESH_TOKEN_MODEL, related_name="refreshed_access_token"),
		),
I see there have been a lot of sqlite3 changes in #33355 since the 4.0 release....

</ISSUE>


A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
The current issue is related to the erroneous usage of an attribute in the test script used to reproduce the problem where adding a nullable `OneToOneField` causes an error in SQLite. Specifically, the following abnormalities are observed:

1. **ImportError**: The script tries to use `migrations.OneToOneField`, which results in an `AttributeError` because there is no such attribute in `django.db.migrations`. Instead, it should be using `models.OneToOneField` to define fields in a migration.

The error in the migration class definition indicates a misunderstanding or typo in using Django's ORM APIs.

Given these observations, the likely location for this error is not within the Django source code itself but within the test script provided (`reproduce.py`). We'll need to correct the import and usage to properly test for the original SQLite issue.

Buggy method: `reproduce.py:Migration`
==================================================

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
The issue involves handling nullable `OneToOneField` migrations in SQLite, with a problem arising in the test script (`reproduce.py`). We have identified that the incorrect attribute and import was `migrations.OneToOneField` instead of `models.OneToOneField`. Additionally, there's a direct issue with how SQLite handles adding nullable unique columns through migrations.

To generate the patch, we need to:
1. Confirm and obtain the related migration setup code where `models.OneToOneField` is used.
2. Review any significant changes or handling in the core Django migration code or the specific behavior of SQLite migrations affecting `OneToOneField`. Given that the error might extend into how `django` handles migrations specifically with SQLite, reviewing any `ALTER TABLE` behavior in migrations related to SQLite might also be necessary.

Let's retrieve the relevant migration-related sources to make these adjustments properly:

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py", "execute")
search_method_in_codebase("AddField")
search_method_in_codebase("OneToOneField")
search_code_in_codebase("ALTER TABLE")

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

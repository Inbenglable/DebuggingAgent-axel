After analyzing the test outputs and the patch provided to fix the issue, we can make the following observations:

1. **Original Output Analysis:**
   - The original output raises an `AttributeError`, indicating that the `functools.partial` object does not have a `__name__` attribute.

2. **Patch Context Analysis:**
   - The patch aims to resolve this by using `functools.update_wrapper` to ensure that decorator attributes (like `__name__`, `__doc__`, etc.) are preserved.

3. **Patched Output Analysis:**
   - The patched output still results in the same `AttributeError`, suggesting that the changes were not effective in preserving the `__name__` attribute of the partial object.

Given that the patched output is identical to the original output and still results in the same error, we can conclude:

Issue resolved: `False`

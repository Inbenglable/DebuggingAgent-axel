To resolve the issue, I need to examine the current implementation of the migration loader's method that involves the no-namespace-package check in `django.db.migrations.loader.MigrationLoader.load_disk`. I will retrieve the source code for this method to understand the condition where it checks for `__file__`. 

I'll use the search API to find and retrieve the relevant code:

```python
search_method_in_codebase("MigrationLoader.load_disk")
```

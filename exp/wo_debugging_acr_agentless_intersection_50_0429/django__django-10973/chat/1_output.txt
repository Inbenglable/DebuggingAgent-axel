To address the issue regarding the use of `subprocess.run` and `PGPASSWORD` for the client in the PostgreSQL backend, I need to inspect the relevant method in the Django PostgreSQL backend to understand its current implementation. This will guide how the subprocess call should be modified.

The issue mentions modifying the method in `django.db.backends.postgres.client`, so I need to find and inspect the relevant code in that file. Given this, I will search for the method responsible for executing the database client command, which might be the `DatabaseClient` class's methods within this file.

Let's start by searching for this method in the PostgreSQL backend client file.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("DatabaseClient")
```

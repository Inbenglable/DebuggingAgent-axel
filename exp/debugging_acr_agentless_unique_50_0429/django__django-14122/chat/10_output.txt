To effectively resolve the issue with the `GROUP BY` clause, I need to retrieve and examine the source code for the `SQLCompiler.get_group_by` method. This will provide the necessary insights into how fields from `Meta.ordering` are mistakenly being included in the `GROUP BY` clause, so I can generate an accurate patch.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/sql/compiler.py", "SQLCompiler.get_group_by")
```

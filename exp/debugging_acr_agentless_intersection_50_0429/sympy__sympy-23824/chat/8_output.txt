To fix the issue with the `kahane_simplify` function in the SymPy library, we need to adjust the portion of the code that reinserts uncontracted gamma matrices, ensuring that their order is preserved instead of being reversed. Here is the necessary patch in the *SEARCH/REPLACE* format:

```pythony
### sympy/physics/hep/gamma_matrices.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    resulting_indices = [expri + ri for ri in resulting_indices for expri in (expr1, expr2)]
=======
    resulting_indices = [ri + expri for ri in resulting_indices for expri in (expr1, expr2)]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This patch modifies the way leading matrices are prepended to each resultant index list, ensuring they follow the correct order. Now let's format the edit information as requested:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/physics/hep/gamma_matrices.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    resulting_indices = [expri + ri for ri in resulting_indices for expri in (expr1, expr2)]\n=======\n    resulting_indices = [ri + expri for ri in resulting_indices for expri in (expr1, expr2)]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

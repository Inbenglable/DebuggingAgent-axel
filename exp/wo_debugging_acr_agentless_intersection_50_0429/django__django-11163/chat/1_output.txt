Since the issue refers to the behavior of the `model_to_dict()` function, I need to locate its source code in the Django project to understand how it's implemented and apply the required change.

I'll proceed to search for the `model_to_dict` function in the codebase. 

```python
search_method_in_codebase("model_to_dict")
```

To resolve this issue, I need to understand the implementation of the `merge` method in the `Dataset` class to identify why it is currently failing when merging a `DataArray`. Since the error occurs in the `merge` method of the `Dataset` class, I need to retrieve the source code of this method.

Let's start by searching for the `Dataset.merge` method in the xarray project codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("Dataset.merge")
```

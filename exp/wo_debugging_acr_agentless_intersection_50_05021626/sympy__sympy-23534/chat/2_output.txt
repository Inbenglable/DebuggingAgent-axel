The current implementation of the `symbols` function attempts to handle cases when the `cls` argument is provided. It appears to iterate over the `names` argument and recursively call `symbols` in case of nested structures, but it does not appropriately pass the `cls` argument in such recursive calls.

To resolve this issue, I need to modify the function to ensure that the `cls` argument is correctly propagated in all recursive calls or when handling tuples or lists.

I have already retrieved the source code for the `symbols` function. Therefore, I am ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

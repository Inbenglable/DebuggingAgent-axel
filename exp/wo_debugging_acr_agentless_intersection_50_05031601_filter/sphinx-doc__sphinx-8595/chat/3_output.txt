To address the issue where `autodoc` is ignoring an empty `__all__` attribute, modifications should likely be made in the `get_object_members` method of the `Documenter` class. This is because the method is responsible for determining which members to document based on the `want_all` flag and the `options.members`. 

The surrounding logic handling `__all__` needs to be adjusted to respect an empty list. However, before implementing the fix, it's necessary to ensure that exceptions accommodate any existing configurations or logic that might affect how members are selected for documentation.

I have gathered relevant code surrounding the implementation of both methods required for creating the patch. Therefore, I am ready to proceed with generating the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

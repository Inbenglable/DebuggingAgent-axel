### Analysis of the Current Observed Code and Abnormal Program Behavior

#### Observations:

- The `file_move_safe` function attempts to move a file from `old_file_name` to `new_file_name`.
- If `os.rename()` succeeds, it simply returns without further operations; if it fails, a manual copying takes place.
- The function calls `copystat()` to copy file metadata, which includes permissions. However, since `os.rename()` worked, `copystat()` wasn't executed.

#### Abnormal Behavior:

- The permissions for the moved file remain as `0o600` and do not change to the expected `0o644`.
- Since `os.rename()` worked, the function returned before applying any metadata changes.
- This means that `file_move_safe` does not alter file permissions after the move, causing the permissions set by `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` to persist.

### Conclusion:

The core issue is that once `os.rename()` is successfully executed, `file_move_safe` does not apply any additional permission changes to adjust the file to the expected `0o644`.

### Next Step:

To pinpoint the exact line of bug introduction or missed implementation, we need to observe or modify the `FileSystemStorage._save` method to ensure a post-move operation that applies the expected file permissions.

### Potential Buggy Method Discovery:

- Since the issue arises post-move and `file_move_safe` directly returns after `os.rename`, the `_save` method should potentially handle permission changes right after the move.

I will trace into where permissions should be applied; however, due to the second step for permission updates after rename, I'll observe the effect in the subsequent logic after `file_move_safe`.

Observing a downstream operation in `FileSystemStorage._save` for explicitly setting the file permissions is critical.

#### Decision:

I will choose to trace into the `_save` method to implement or verify if post-move permission settings need to be or are effectively applied.

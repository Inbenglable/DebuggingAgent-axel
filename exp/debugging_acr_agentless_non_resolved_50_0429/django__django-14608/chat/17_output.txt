Based on the information provided, let's review the patch and analyze the test outputs:

### Patch Analysis
1. **Patch Changes:**
   - The patch modifies the initialization of `self._non_form_errors` in the `BaseFormSet` class to include a 'nonform' CSS class by using `mark_safe('<ul class="nonform">')`.
   - It also updates the re-assignment of `self._non_form_errors` to ensure it includes the 'nonform' CSS class as a prefix to the list of errors.

2. **Intended Effect:**
   - These changes ensure that non-form errors in a FormSet are encapsulated within a list that includes a 'nonform' CSS class, which aligns with the issue's requirement to allow custom `ErrorList` to distinguish between different types of errors.

### Test Output Analysis
- **Original Output:**
  - Displays a traceback ending with an `AssertionError`: "Non-form errors do not have the 'nonform' CSS class."
  - This indicates that the non-form errors in the original implementation were not associated with the 'nonform' CSS class, as expected.

- **Patched Output:**
  - Prints "Issue is fixed: Non-form errors have the 'nonform' CSS class."
  - This confirms that after the patch is applied, the non-form errors are correctly associated with the 'nonform' CSS class, satisfying the issue's requirement.

### Conclusion
- The patch effectively addresses the problem described in the issue. The presence of the 'nonform' CSS class in the non-form errors is now correctly verified by the test, which indicates that the patch successfully resolves the issue.

Therefore, the issue is resolved with the applied patch.

Issue resolved: `True`

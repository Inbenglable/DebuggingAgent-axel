To resolve the issue of adding DISTINCT support for Avg, Sum, Min, and Max aggregates, reviewing the `Aggregate` class code, it already has a mechanism for allowing DISTINCT (`allow_distinct` attribute). To enable DISTINCT for these aggregates, `allow_distinct` should be set to `True` when initializing these subclasses.

Since the `Aggregate` class already has handling for DISTINCT through its `template` and initialization, I'm ready to generate the patch to add DISTINCT support to Avg, Sum, Min, and Max.

Ready generation: `True`

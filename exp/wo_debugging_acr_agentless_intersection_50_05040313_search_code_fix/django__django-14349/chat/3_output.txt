To address the issue with the `URLValidator` handling URLs with line feed (`\n`), carriage return (`\r`), and tab characters, I need to first update the `URLValidator` to either:

1. Strip these characters before processing the URL.
2. Or raise a validation error if such characters are found in the input URLs.

The source code for `URLValidator` has already been retrieved, and I've seen that its `__call__` method is responsible for URL processing. Therefore, I have the relevant code to proceed with creating a patch.

I'm ready to generate the patch for the `URLValidator` to improve its validation logic.

Ready generation: `True`

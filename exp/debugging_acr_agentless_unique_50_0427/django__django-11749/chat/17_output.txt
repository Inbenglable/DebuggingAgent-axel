To determine if the issue is resolved, we need to examine the patched output in relation to the original issue described. The original issue involves the failure of `call_command` when an argument of a required mutually exclusive group is passed via keyword arguments, resulting in a `CommandError`.

Upon reviewing the original output, the error message indicates that the command `command` is unknown, which suggests that the function `call_command` fails internally, leading to a `CommandError`.

The proposed patch modifies how arguments are added to `parse_args` by including arguments that are part of required mutually exclusive groups in its construction. This logical adjustment should help `call_command` handle mutually exclusive groups correctly by considering them required even if individual options are not marked as such.

However, comparing the original and patched outputs, they remain identical, indicating that the `CommandError` persists, and the assertion error still triggers, stating that `call_command` fails when a required mutually exclusive argument is passed in kwargs.

Since the output is the same before and after applying the patch, the issue has not been resolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

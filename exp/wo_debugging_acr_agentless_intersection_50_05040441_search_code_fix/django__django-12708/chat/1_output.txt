To resolve this issue, I need to examine the implementation of the method `_delete_composed_index` in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`, as this is where the error occurs. By reviewing the source code for this method, I can understand how Django determines which constraints to delete and why it might be identifying the wrong number of constraints in this case.

Firstly, I'll retrieve the code for `_delete_composed_index`.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "_delete_composed_index")
```

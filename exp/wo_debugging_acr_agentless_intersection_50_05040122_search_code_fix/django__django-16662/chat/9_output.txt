### Patch Review:
The patch modifies the sorting logic in the `MigrationWriter.as_string` method responsible for the order of imports in generated migration files. It aims to ensure that standard imports (`import ...`) appear before specific imports (`from ... import ...`). The patch introduces a tuple in the sorting key to prioritize `import` statements over `from import` statements, aligning with the specified Django coding style and `isort` defaults.

### Analysis of Test Output:

#### Original Output:
The test fails with a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module named `test_app`. This suggests that the setup step did not correctly configure or recognize the test application directory, preventing any migration generation or import order validation from occurring.

#### Patched Output:
The patched output produces the same error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'test_app'`. This indicates that the patch did not affect the root issue causing the test failure, as the error relates to the setup of the test environment rather than the sorting of imports.

### Conclusion:
The patch alters import sorting logic but the test setup fails before evaluating this logic due to a module not found error. Thus, there is no indication of the import ordering issue being addressed or validated because the test does not reach the point of migration checking.

### Resolution Status:
Issue resolved: `False`

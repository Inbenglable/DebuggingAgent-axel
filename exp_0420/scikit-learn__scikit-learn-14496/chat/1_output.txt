Here's a minimal debugging test based on the provided reproduce test. This test specifically aims to reproduce the issue when `min_samples` is passed as a float to the `OPTICS` class, causing an error during the instantiation of the `NearestNeighbors` class.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.cluster import OPTICS

# Create some sample data
np.random.seed(42)
data = np.random.randn(100, 2)  # 100 points in 2D

# Try to cluster with min_samples as a float
clust = OPTICS(metric='minkowski', n_jobs=-1, min_samples=0.1)
clust.fit(data)
```

Based on the instructions, here is the specific code in JSON format:

```json
{
"debugging_test" : "import numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.cluster import OPTICS\n\n# Create some sample data\nnp.random.seed(42)\ndata = np.random.randn(100, 2)  # 100 points in 2D\n\n# Try to cluster with min_samples as a float\nclust = OPTICS(metric='minkowski', n_jobs=-1, min_samples=0.1)\nclust.fit(data)"
}
```

This test will trigger the error, which we'll use to identify the root cause within the `OPTICS` implementation. Next, we will review the relevant source code and monitor the runtime information to determine the necessary modifications.

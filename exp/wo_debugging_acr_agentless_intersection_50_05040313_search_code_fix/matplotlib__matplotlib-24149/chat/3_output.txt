To address the issue with `ax.bar` raising an exception when passed only NaN data, the solution focuses on handling such values gracefully within the `_safe_first_finite` function. This function seems to inadvertently raise a `StopIteration` error due to the absence of non-NaN values. I'll adjust this function to handle input arrays that solely contain NaN elements, ensuring it returns None in such cases without raising an exception.

Here is the patch to handle the issue:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        return next(val for val in obj if safe_isfinite(val))\n=======\n        return next((val for val in obj if safe_isfinite(val)), None)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This edit modifies the `_safe_first_finite` function to include a default value of `None`, which ensures that if no finite value is found in the iterable, it returns `None` instead of raising `StopIteration`. This fix prevents `ax.bar` from breaking when given NaN data.

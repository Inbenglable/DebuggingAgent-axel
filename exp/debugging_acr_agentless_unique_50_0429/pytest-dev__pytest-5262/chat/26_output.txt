To determine whether the issue is resolved, let's break down the patch and the test outputs.

### Patch Review

**Patch Context:**
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### src/_pytest/capture.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        return getattr(object.__getattribute__(self, \"buffer\"), name)\n=======\n        if name == 'mode':\n            mode = getattr(object.__getattribute__(self, \"buffer\"), name)\n            return mode.replace('b', '') if 'b' in mode else mode\n        return getattr(object.__getattribute__(self, \"buffer\"), name)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

In `_pytest/capture.py`, the patch modifies the function to change the behavior when accessing the `mode` attribute. Instead of directly returning the `mode` from the underlying buffer, the patch removes the `'b'` character from the mode string if it's present, effectively removing the binary mode flag.

### Test Outputs

**Original Output:**
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest-5262/reproduce.py", line 1, in <module>
    import youtube_dl
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'youtube_dl'
```

**Patched Output:**
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest-5262/reproduce.py", line 1, in <module>
    import youtube_dl
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'youtube_dl'
```

### Analysis

Both the original and patched outputs are indicating a `ModuleNotFoundError`, which signifies that the module `youtube_dl` is not installed or accessible in the environment. This is a configuration issue unrelated to the functionality patch itself.

The patch itself seems logically correct for resolving the issue described. It directly addresses the bug by modifying how the `mode` property is returned, ensuring it doesn't include the `'b'` for binary mode. However, without installing `youtube_dl` or correcting the environment setup, the patch's impact cannot be validated via the test outputs provided.

### Conclusion

The patch theoretically addresses the issue by removing the binary indicator 'b' from file modes provided by `_pytest.capture.EncodedFile`. However, due to the absence of `youtube_dl`, the test outputs cannot verify this fix as they only show an import error. Under normal circumstances with `youtube_dl` installed, this patch should resolve the issue, assuming no further dependencies or errors.

Issue resolved: `True` (The patch provides a fix for the described problem based on the code logic.)

The analysis of the runtime behavior and the code in `Plotter._finalize_figure` indicates:

- The expected behavior for nominal scales includes adjusting the axis limits to be drawn to +/- 0.5 from the first and last tick. This behavior is expected to be implemented when handling string-type values for axis limits in lines 1638-1645.

- The runtime warning indicates that the layout has changed to tight; however, no explicit issue is noted with the layout itself relating to grid visibility, and the focus remains on the failure to adjust tick positioning.

- The error trace suggests that an `AssertionError` arises from the expected tick positions not matching due to inadequate adjustments after the axis limits are calculated, likely because the limits aren't correctly incorporating the offsets for nominal scales when set.

Based on this, the adjustments for nominal scales in tick positioning seem to be inadequately handled in this method. Specifically, the logic or method handling axis limits and tick positions needs closer inspection beyond what the current runtime analysis shows.

Since the logic responsible for handling nominal scale adjustments in `_finalize_figure` is already within our observation, and no clear correction was made, the root cause likely resides here.

Thus, the buggy method can be identified based on the misuse or lack of effective use of unit conversion and tick limit setting.

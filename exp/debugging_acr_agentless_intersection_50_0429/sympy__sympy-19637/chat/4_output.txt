To resolve the issue where the 'kern' variable is referenced before assignment in the `kernS` function, we need to initialize `kern` before it's used in the line `hit = kern in s`. Here's how to fix it properly without disrupting the overall functionality:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/core/sympify.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    hit = False\n    quoted = '\"' in s or \"'\" in s\n=======\n    kern = ''\n    hit = False\n    quoted = '\"' in s or \"'\" in s\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This change ensures that `kern` is initialized as an empty string initially, which prevents the `UnboundLocalError` if the subsequent conditions that assign a unique value to `kern` are not met.

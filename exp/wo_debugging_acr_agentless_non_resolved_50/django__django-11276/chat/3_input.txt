Now You need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Use Python stdlib html.escape() to in django.utils.html.escape()
Description
	
The function django.utils.html.escape() partially duplicates the Python stdlib function html.escape(). We can replace this duplication with wider community developed version.
html.escape() has been available since Python 3.2:
​https://docs.python.org/3/library/html.html#html.escape
This function is also faster than Django's. As Python bug ​https://bugs.python.org/issue18020 concludes, using .replace() can be faster than .translate(). This function gets called numerous times when rendering templates. After making the change locally, I saw the following improvement:
master:
$ python -m timeit -s 'from django.utils.html import escape' 'escape(copyright)'
50000 loops, best of 5: 4.03 usec per loop
branch:
$ python -m timeit -s 'from django.utils.html import escape' 'escape(copyright)'
100000 loops, best of 5: 2.45 usec per loop
One small concern, html.escape() converts ' to &#x27 rather than &#39. These values are functionally equivalent HTML, but I'll mention it as a backwards incompatible change as the literal text has changed

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To address the issue, I need to replace the Django's `escape` function with Python's `html.escape`. First, I need to locate and review the existing `escape` method in the `django.utils.html` module.

Therefore, I'll search for the `escape` method within the appropriate file.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("escape")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("escape")
RESULT:
#### django/utils/html.py:escape
```python
def escape(text):
    """
    Return the given text with ampersands, quotes and angle brackets encoded
    for use in HTML.

    Always escape input, even if it's already escaped and marked as such.
    This may result in double-escaping. If this is a concern, use
    conditional_escape() instead.
    """
    return mark_safe(str(text).translate(_html_escapes))

```


==================================================

Your Output:
Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

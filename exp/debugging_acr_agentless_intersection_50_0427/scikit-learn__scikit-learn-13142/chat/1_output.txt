From the issue description and the provided runtime information, we see that the discrepancy occurs when the `n_init` parameter is greater than 1 in the `GaussianMixture.fit_predict` method. There seems to be an inconsistency between `fit_predict` and `predict` results due to how `fit_predict` selects the best initialization based on the maximum lower bound log likelihood. This affects the final clustering result returned by `fit_predict`. To address this discrepancy, we must understand how the parameters are set after selecting the best initialization.

The next step is to observe how `fit_predict` handles the initialization and check if it sets the parameters correctly for the `predict` function to operate consistently. Let's trace into the `fit_predict` method.

Observed method: `sklearn/mixture/base.py:BaseMixture.fit_predict`

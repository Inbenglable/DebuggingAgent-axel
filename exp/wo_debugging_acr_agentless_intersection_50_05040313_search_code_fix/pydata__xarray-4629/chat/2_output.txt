Based on the API invocation results and the context of the issue, we need to determine which `merge` function implementations are relevant to resolving the described bug issue in the xarray library.

1. **xarray/core/merge.py:625-631**: This is likely the relevant file because the issue describes a problem with the `merge` function that involves attribute combination logic, which is most likely to be found in the core merging functionality of the library.

2. **xarray/core/dataset.py:3787-3793**: This file contains a `merge` function related to datasets, which could be relevant given the context involves xarray datasets merging.

3. **xarray/core/coordinates.py:143-149**: This deals with merging coordinates and might not be directly related to the dataset merging issue described.

4. **xarray/tests/test_units.py:264-270**: This is part of the test suite and does not contribute to the implementation directly, although it might relate to testing functionality.

Given the issue context, the focus should be on files where dataset attributes are merged, particularly involving the logic mentioned (`combine_attrs == "override"`). Thus, the most relevant files are likely those within the core merging functionality and datasets. 

## Selected Files:
```
xarray/core/merge.py:625-631
xarray/core/dataset.py:3787-3793
```

To resolve the issue, we need to modify how headers are handled in the `Session` class when a header value is set to `None`. Since we have the implementation of the `__init__` method and the `prepare_request` method, which deals with session headers, we are ready to proceed with generating a patch. We will focus on ensuring that headers set to `None` are not included in the requests made by the session.

Ready generation: `True`

In reviewing the source code of the `construct` method within the `Coarsen` class, I have identified the part of the implementation that needs modification. Currently, after constructing the reshaped dataset, there is a logic that attempts to set coordinates based on dimensions from the `window_dim` and the original object's coordinates. However, the `should_be_coords` logic may not encapsulate all necessary coordinates correctly concerning the issue reported, which results in some non-dimensional coordinates being treated as regular variables.

I have sufficient context on the method's source code from the `xarray/core/rolling.py` file. Therefore, I am ready to generate a patch for resolving this issue.

Ready generation: `True`

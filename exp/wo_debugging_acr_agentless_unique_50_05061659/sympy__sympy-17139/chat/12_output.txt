Here's a patch to resolve the issue in the SymPy project, particularly focusing on handling complex exponent comparisons in the `_TR56` method of `fu.py`.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/simplify/fu.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if (rv.exp < 0) == True:\n=======\n        if rv.exp.is_number and (rv.exp < 0) == True:\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### sympy/simplify/fu.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if (rv.exp > max) == True:\n=======\n        if rv.exp.is_number and (rv.exp > max) == True:\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch ensures that the comparisons using `<` and `>` are only performed when `rv.exp` is a numeric value, avoiding any TypeError when dealing with complex numbers. This fix aims to preserve the original functionality while preventing invalid comparisons.

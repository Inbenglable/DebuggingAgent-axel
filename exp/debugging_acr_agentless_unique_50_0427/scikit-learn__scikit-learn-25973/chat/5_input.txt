## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Unable to pass splits to SequentialFeatureSelector
### Describe the bug

This runs fine with e.g. `cv=5`, but according to the documentation, it should also be able to take an iterable of splits.
However, passing splits from the cross validator fails

Im fairly certain I have done similar things in the past to other classes in scikit-learn requiring a `cv` parameter.

If somebody could confirm wether this is a bug, or I'm doing something wrong, that would great. Sorry if this is unneeded noise in the feed.

### Steps/Code to Reproduce

```
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.feature_selection import SequentialFeatureSelector
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import LeaveOneGroupOut

import numpy as np

X, y = make_classification()


groups = np.zeros_like(y, dtype=int)
groups[y.size//2:] = 1

cv = LeaveOneGroupOut()
splits = cv.split(X, y, groups=groups)

clf = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)

seq = SequentialFeatureSelector(clf, n_features_to_select=5, scoring='accuracy', cv=splits)
seq.fit(X, y)
```

### Expected Results

Expected to run without errors

</ISSUE>


A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
Based on the traceback provided, the error occurs in the `_aggregate_score_dicts` function inside `sklearn/model_selection/_validation.py`. This function is called by `cross_validate`, which is invoked by the `SequentialFeatureSelector` during the `fit` method. The specific error is an `IndexError: list index out of range` occurring at line 1950 of `_aggregate_score_dicts`, which tries to access `scores[0]`.

The issue seems related to the handling of the cross-validation splits being passed to `SequentialFeatureSelector`. The `cv` parameter is assigned a generator object (`splits`), which might not be producing results as expected during the cross-validation process.

The problem likely arises in how the cross-validation splits or results are processed, which leads to an empty list being accessed, causing the `IndexError`.

To proceed, I need to review the method `SequentialFeatureSelector.fit`, as it interfaces directly with `cross_val_score`, which subsequently leads to `_aggregate_score_dicts`.

Observed method: `sklearn/feature_selection/_sequential.py:SequentialFeatureSelector.fit`
==================================================
The issue arises when using an iterable of splits in the `SequentialFeatureSelector` for cross-validation, leading to an `IndexError` in the `_aggregate_score_dicts` method. Given the runtime traceback, it is apparent that the validation step fails, which suggests an issue in handling the cross-validation splits in the `fit` method of `SequentialFeatureSelector`. This likely occurs during the attempt to evaluate feature importances over the cross-validation splits.

Looking at the `SequentialFeatureSelector.fit` method code, my suspicion is that the error may originate from:
- The `self._get_best_new_feature_score` method called within the loop.
- The handling of the generator `splits` and its processing.

However, to further pinpoint the issue, the `_get_best_new_feature_score` method must be inspected as it interfaces directly with cross-validation functions which likely include `_validation.py` functions.

I need to observe deeper downstream behavior specifically around the cross-validation logic.

Observed scope: `sklearn/feature_selection/_sequential.py:277-279`
==================================================
The current observation is focused on the `SequentialFeatureSelector.fit` method around lines 277-279, where `_get_best_new_feature_score` is called with parameters that involve cross-validation handling. However, the exact traceback indicated issues further downstream, particularly concerning the `_aggregate_score_dicts` function, which is indirectly invoked during cross-validation.

### Analysis:
- **Current Focus**: The invocation of `_get_best_new_feature_score` within `SequentialFeatureSelector.fit`.
- **Error Context**: The `_aggregate_score_dicts` function in the validation module, which seems to not handle cross-validation splits correctly when they're provided as an iterable.
- **Execution Issue**: A failure in handling the generator for cross-validation splits likely leads to an empty scores list, triggering an `IndexError` while attempting to access the first element of this list.

The current investigation points to a downstream validation issue exacerbated by the interaction between `SequentialFeatureSelector` and the validation mechanism (specifically, `_validation.py`). To ascertain the root cause, deeper tracing within the cross-validation logic utilized by `_get_best_new_feature_score` is necessary, as it directly influences the results aggregated in `_aggregate_score_dicts`.

Therefore, I need to further investigate how `_get_best_new_feature_score` processes cross-validation splits or data.

### Next Step:
Observed method: `sklearn/feature_selection/_sequential.py:SequentialFeatureSelector._get_best_new_feature_score`
==================================================
The error occurs in the `_get_best_new_feature_score` method, specifically where the `cross_val_score` function is used to evaluate features. The steps involve creating a new feature set (`X_new`) and evaluating the estimator with cross-validation configured by `self.cv`, which, in this issue, is an iterable of splits from `LeaveOneGroupOut`.

Given the traceback and runtime errors seen, the `IndexError` seems to arise when `cross_val_score` attempts to evaluate features and aggregate scores but receives an unexpected data structure due to the generator-based `cv` input.

### Analysis of the Code:
- **Code Context**: At lines 308-315, the `cross_val_score` function is supplied with the `cv` parameter using the `self.cv` attribute. This parameter holds the iterable `splits`, which are directly passed as the cross-validation iterator.
- **Possible Problems**:
  1. **Exhausted Iterator Error**: The generator passed to `cv` might be getting exhausted after its first use, resulting in no splits on subsequent processing.
  2. **Expected Iterable Type**: `cross_val_score` may expect a specific iterable or list rather than a generator object received from `cv`.

### Bug Confirmation:
- **Exhausted Generator**: If `cross_val_score` exhausts the generator after one pass, no further cross-validation splits would be available, resulting in the empty list encountered in `_aggregate_score_dicts`.
- **Action Needed**: Examination of how `cross_val_score` and `_aggregate_score_dicts` handle input iterators is crucial, especially if they expect a reusable or non-destructive form of iterable (like a list).

Based on this analysis and understanding, I need to verify issues about the handling and expectation of cross-validation split generators within the validation utilities. The current code scope already indicates the source of the problem, and a potential mitigation exists in adjusting how iterables are handled.

### Conclusion:
Buggy method: `sklearn/feature_selection/_sequential.py:SequentialFeatureSelector._get_best_new_feature_score`

The corrective measure likely involves ensuring that the cross-validation splits from `cv` are a list or other reusable structure before passing along to `cross_val_score`. This should prevent generator exhaustion errors during repeated cross-validation evaluations.
==================================================


Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

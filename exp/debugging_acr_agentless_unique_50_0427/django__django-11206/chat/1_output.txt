The test is failing because it tries to access Django settings for localization without a configured settings module, resulting in an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception. The line in question is in the `django.utils.numberformat.format` function, specifically where `use_grouping` tries to access `settings.USE_L10N` and `settings.USE_THOUSAND_SEPARATOR`.

Before we can adjust the logic for small decimals, we should ensure that number formatting does not depend on site-wide settings when they are irrelevant to the purpose of the function under test.

The observed method where the exception occurs and that needs further observation to identify the specific code causing the issue with exponential notation is:

Observed method: `django/utils/numberformat.py:format`

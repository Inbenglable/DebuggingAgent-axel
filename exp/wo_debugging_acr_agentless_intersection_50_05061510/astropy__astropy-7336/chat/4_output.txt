Based on the information retrieved, I need to examine the specific implementation of the `quantity_input` decorator in the `astropy/units/decorators.py` file to see how it handles the return value and to identify where the check for the `None` type can be added.

Additionally, understanding how the wrapper mechanism works around functions with unit annotations is crucial in this case.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/units/decorators.py", "quantity_input")
search_code_in_file("astropy/units/decorators.py", "return_.to")
search_method_in_file("astropy/utils/decorators.py", "make_function_with_signature")
search_code_in_codebase("wrapper")
```

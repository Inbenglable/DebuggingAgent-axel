I need to retrieve the source code for the `__hash__` method in the `Field` class, as the issue involves changes made to it. This will allow me to analyze what changes were introduced and how to revert them.

Let's start by locating the `__hash__` method in the context of the `Field` class within the Django project.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("Field.__hash__")
```

Based on the inspection of the `MockDatabaseWrapper.__init__` method and the `BaseDatabaseWrapper.__init__` method, I have gathered the necessary information to resolve the issue. The issue involves properly passing a `settings_dict` to the constructor of `BaseDatabaseWrapper` from `MockDatabaseWrapper`.

### Analysis:

1. **Understand Structure of `settings_dict`:**
   - The `settings_dict` expected by `BaseDatabaseWrapper.__init__` should be a dictionary containing keys such as `NAME`, `USER`, etc. This indicates that the minimal settings required should at least have these keys, even if they are mock values.

2. **Fix `MockDatabaseWrapper.__init__`:**
   - When initializing `MockDatabaseWrapper`, ensure that a valid `settings_dict` is created and passed to `super().__init__()` during the construction.

Given this understanding, I am ready to generate the patch to fix the issue by modifying the `MockDatabaseWrapper.__init__` method to properly pass the `settings_dict`.

Ready generation: `True`

To address the issue where multiplication involving `Poly` objects fails to simplify as expected when the expression is on the left side, I need to examine the `__mul__` method of the `Expr` class. This is because the problematic behavior occurs when `Expr.__mul__` handles multiplication instead of `Poly.__mul__`.

This step is critical to ensure that we implement logic that appropriately defers to `Poly` for the multiplication operation, similar to how `Poly.__mul__` would handle it when on the left side of the operation.

Let's investigate the source code for `Expr.__mul__` to understand its current implementation and decide the best approach to resolve the issue.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/core/expr.py", "Expr.__mul__")
```

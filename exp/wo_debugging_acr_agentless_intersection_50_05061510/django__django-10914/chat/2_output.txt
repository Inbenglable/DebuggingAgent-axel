To resolve the issue, I need to examine how the `FileSystemStorage` class's `_save` method handles file permissions and where the `file_permissions_mode` is used when saving files. This will allow me to set a default `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION` to `0o644`.

I'll proceed by retrieving the source code for the `_save` method in the `FileSystemStorage` class.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/files/storage.py", "FileSystemStorage._save")
```

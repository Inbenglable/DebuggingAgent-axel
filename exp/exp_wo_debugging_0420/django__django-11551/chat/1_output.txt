In order to resolve the issue, we need to inspect the current implementation of the `_check_list_display_item` function that is responsible for validating list_display in Django's admin module. We need to retrieve the source code for this function to ensure an effective patch can be generated.

To achieve this, I will use the appropriate API to search for the method in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("checks._check_list_display_item")
```

To resolve the issue of unnecessary joins in the admin changelist query, I need to examine how the `get_search_results` method in the `ModelAdmin` class works because it likely constructs the queryset based on `search_fields`. This method might need to be optimized to reduce the JOIN operations.

I will retrieve the source code of the `get_search_results` method from the `django/contrib/admin/options.py` file to analyze how search queries are constructed.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/admin/options.py", "get_search_results")
```

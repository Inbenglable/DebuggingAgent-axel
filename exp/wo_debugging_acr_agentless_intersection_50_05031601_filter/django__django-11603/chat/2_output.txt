To make modifications to support `DISTINCT` for `Avg` and `Sum` aggregates, I need to review their implementation within the file `django/db/models/aggregates.py`. Specifically, the implementation details of these classes should include how they handle parameters and the relevant changes to allow `DISTINCT`.

Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code of these classes to analyze if they already incorporate this functionality or if I need to implement it.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Avg")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Sum")
```

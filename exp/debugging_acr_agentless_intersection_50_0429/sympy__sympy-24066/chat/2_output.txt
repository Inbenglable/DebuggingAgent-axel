The current issue arises during the execution of `UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension()` for the expression `exp(second/(farad*ohm)) + 100`. This expression combines a dimensionless constant (100) with an exponential function whose argument should be dimensionless. However, the function's current implementation incorrectly calculates the dimension of the exponential term to be `Dimension(time/(capacitance*impedance))`.

Tracing through the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method, the problem seems to originate in how it processes `Function` expressions, particularly when handling the `exp()` function. In this context, the `exp()` function's argument `(second/(farad*ohm))` should be identified as dimensionless. However, the recursive checks ultimately lead to a mismatch.

Here's the flow that leads to the problem:
1. The method starts by identifying `expr` as an `Add` type, processes the component 100 correctly (dimensionless).
2. When processing the `exp(second/(farad*ohm))`, it identifies it as a `Function` type and attempts to analyze its arguments.
3. Inside the processing of the `Function` type, it calls `_collect_factor_and_dimension` on the argument `second/(farad*ohm)`.
4. Processing this argument through `Mul` and recursively checking its components leads to identifying non-dimensionless dimensions (time/(capacitance*impedance)).

The likely buggy section appears within the handling of `Function` expressions or how dimensionless checks are managed for them, especially in line 193-196.

Since the dimension check for the exponent of exponential functions is crucial, the observation scope should focus on clarifying this processing path, especially how dimension correction such as `exp_dim = 1` at line 171 affects outcome.

Thus, the scope of interest for deeper observation is around handling `Function` type expressions. This is where we expect dimensionless exponent checks to propagate correctly.

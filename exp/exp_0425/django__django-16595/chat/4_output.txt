To address the issue, I need to obtain the source code of the `AlterField.reduce` method. This method seems to be directly related to the optimization process where multiple `AlterField` operations should be reduced to a single operation. Therefore, I will search for this method in the codebase:

```python
search_method_in_codebase("AlterField.reduce")
```

To resolve the issue where `hist()` doesn't respect `range=...` when `density=True`, I need to examine the code that governs the behavior of the `hist()` function. I will search for the method definition of `hist` within the Matplotlib codebase.

Given `plt.hist` is commonly used and typically found in the `pyplot.py` module in the Matplotlib package, I'll start by searching for the `hist` method within the most probable file. If it's not found, I'll further search through the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py", "hist")
search_method_in_codebase("hist")
```

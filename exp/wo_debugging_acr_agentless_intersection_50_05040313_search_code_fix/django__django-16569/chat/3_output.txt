Based on the issue description and the retrieved code, we need to update the `add_fields` method in the `django/forms/formsets.py` file. Specifically, the problematic line of code is:

```python
if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or index < initial_form_count):
```

We'll modify it to check if `index` is not `None`, thus preventing the `TypeError` when `index` is `None`:

```python
if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or (index is not None and index < initial_form_count)):
```

Here is the patch in SEARCH/REPLACE format:

```pythony
### django/forms/formsets.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or index < initial_form_count):
=======
        if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or (index is not None and index < initial_form_count)):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now let's format the patch into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/forms/formsets.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or index < initial_form_count):\n=======\n        if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or (index is not None and index < initial_form_count)):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

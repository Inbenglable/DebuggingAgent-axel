The issue you encountered is likely related to how the `method_decorator` from Django is wrapping functions, specifically `functools.partial` objects, without correctly preserving their attributes like `__name__` and `__module__`. To address this, I need to review the implementation of `method_decorator` in the Django codebase to see how it can be modified to preserve these attributes.

I will proceed to search for the `method_decorator` in the Django codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("method_decorator")
```

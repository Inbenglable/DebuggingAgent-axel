To resolve the issue of a `UnicodeError` being raised instead of an `InvalidURL` exception, we need to update the exception handling logic in the `Adapter.send` method of the `requests/adapters.py` file. The goal includes catching `urllib3.exceptions.LocationParseError` and raising `requests.exceptions.InvalidURL`.

Here's the suggested modification in the format requested:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### requests/adapters.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        except LocationValueError as e:\n            raise InvalidURL(e, request=request)\n=======\n        except (LocationValueError, LocationParseError) as e:\n            raise InvalidURL(e, request=request)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

In this patch:
- The `Adapter.send` method now includes an exception handler for `LocationParseError` in addition to `LocationValueError`.
- Both exceptions are now caught and transformed into an `InvalidURL` exception, aligning the behavior with the project's expected handling of invalid URLs.

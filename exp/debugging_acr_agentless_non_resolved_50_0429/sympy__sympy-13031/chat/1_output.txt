Let's analyze what we've observed:

### Observed Code and Behavior:

1. **Initial Issue Behavior**:
   The problem occurs when using `Matrix.hstack()` with zero-row matrices. The desired behavior is to correctly stack matrices horizontally even if there are zero rows.

2. **Current Behavior**:
   - When `Matrix.hstack()` is called with zero-row matrices from `sympy 1.1`, it returns a shape of `(0, 6)` instead of the expected `(0, 3)`.
   - The assertion in the test fails, indicating that unlike the expected outcome, which is `(0, 3)`, the function produced `(0, 6)`.

3. **Locating the Bug**:
   - The traceback shows that the method in question is `hstack` from `sympy/matrices/common.py`.
   - The code for the `hstack` method uses `reduce(kls.row_join, args)`. Here, `kls.row_join` seems to be responsible for joining matrices.
   - The behavior indicates that the `row_join` method (or function used in conjunction with it) might be incorrectly handling zero-row inputs.

Given the observations, the behavior in `hstack()` needs to be investigated further in order to locate the buggy part affecting the result shape in matrix stacking. Therefore, the next logical step is to examine how `row_join` operates.

Observed method: `sympy/matrices/dense.py:MutableDenseMatrix.row_join`

To determine if the patch resolves the issue, let's analyze the details:

### Original Issue
The problem was that `Meta.ordering` fields were incorrectly included in the `GROUP BY` clause during SQL query generation, which could lead to erroneous aggregation results.

### Test Explanation
A test was crafted to trigger this defect by:
1. Defining a model `MyModel` with `Meta.ordering = ['name']`.
2. Attempting a `GROUP BY` query that should not include the `name` field in `GROUP BY`.

The original test output showed that there was an issue with the setup test environment rather than proving or disproving the specific bug with the `GROUP BY` clause.

### Patch Overview
The patch aims to prevent fields defined in `Meta.ordering` from being automatically included in the `GROUP BY` clause by modifying the `get_group_by` method to skip such fields during the query compilation process.

### Test Output Analysis
Both the original and patched outputs show a `RuntimeError` related to the test setup environment (`setup_test_environment()` issue) rather than an error directly related to SQL query execution or the bug specified.

### Conclusion
The persistent `RuntimeError` indicates that the test itself doesn't correctly execute due to test environment setup issues. This makes it difficult to claim the issue with the `GROUP BY` clause has been resolved based solely on the output. The technical details of the patch suggest it should handle the issue logically, but the faulty test outcomes make it impossible to conclusively verify the fix in context.

Therefore, in terms of the available data and provided test results:

Issue resolved: `False`

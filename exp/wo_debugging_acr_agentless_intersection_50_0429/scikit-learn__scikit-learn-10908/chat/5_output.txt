The information gathered shows the `get_feature_names` method in the `CountVectorizer` class relies on the `_check_vocabulary` method to ensure that the vocabulary is set. To resolve this, we need to modify the `get_feature_names` method so it only raises a `NotFittedError` if the vocabulary is both not provided manually and has not been fitted through training.

All relevant source code for these methods has been retrieved, so we are ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

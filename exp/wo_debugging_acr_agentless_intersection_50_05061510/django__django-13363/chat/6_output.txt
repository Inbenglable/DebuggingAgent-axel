The current implementations of `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` in the `as_sql` methods use `timezone.get_current_timezone_name()` for obtaining the timezone, which disregards any `tzinfo` parameter passed to them. To address this issue, I need to modify these methods to use the passed `tzinfo` when `settings.USE_TZ` is `True`. Since I already have the relevant parts of the code for `TruncDate` and `TruncTime`, I can proceed to generate the patch without further code retrieval.

Ready generation: `True`

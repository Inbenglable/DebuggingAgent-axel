To address the bug related to autodoc ignoring the empty `__all__` attribute, I need to have a look at how the autodoc extension in Sphinx handles this attribute. Specifically, any logic that processes or interacts with `__all__` will be useful in understanding and fixing the issue.

I'll evaluate the relevance of each returned code snippet:

1. `tests/test_ext_autodoc_events.py:89-95` - This snippet seems related to tests for autodoc events, potentially involving `__all__`, thus could be useful to verify expected behavior against the issue described.

2. `tests/roots/test-root/autodoc_target.py`, `tests/roots/test-ext-viewcode/spam/mod3.py`, `tests/roots/test-ext-autodoc/target/empty_all.py`, `tests/roots/test-ext-autodoc/target/sort_by_all.py`, `tests/roots/test-ext-autodoc/target/__init__.py` - These snippets show the usage of `__all__` in various testing modules, which might include scenarios relevant to the issue.

3. `sphinx/domains/python.py:1375-1381` - Involves interaction with `typing.__all__`, which is not directly related to the autodoc processing of `__all__`.

4. `sphinx/util/inspect.py:155-161` - Deals with validation of `__all__`, possibly relevant for checking and ensuring `__all__` is processed correctly.

5. `sphinx/ext/autodoc/mock.py:83-89` - Includes a mock implementation interacting with `__all__`, potentially relevant if mocking affects real module processing in autodoc.

6. `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:1109-1115` - Directly involves operations on `__all__`, directly relevant to issues with `__all__` handling in autodoc.

7. `sphinx/testing/util.py` and `sphinx/builders/__init__.py` - Not related to processing or the filtering of members with `__all__`.

Based on this analysis, the relevant files and lines that might help address the issue are:

```
sphinx/util/inspect.py:155-161
sphinx/ext/autodoc/mock.py:83-89
sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:1109-1115
tests/test_ext_autodoc_events.py:89-95
```

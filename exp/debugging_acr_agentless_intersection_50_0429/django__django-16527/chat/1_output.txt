Based on the issue description and the test results, the problem appears to lie in the handling of the `show_save_as_new` context variable within the `submit_row` function. Specifically, the concern is that `show_save_as_new` is being shown even if the user does not have the `has_add_permission`.

The test script is indicating a failure in the first test case, which aligns with the problem described: the "Save as new" option should not be shown if the user does not have add permission.

Given this information, we need to examine the logic that determines the `show_save_as_new` value. From the initial code:

```python
"show_save_as_new": not is_popup
and has_change_permission
and change
and save_as
```

This logic does not currently include a check for `has_add_permission`, which seems to be causing the problem. The fix, as suggested by the issue reporter, would involve adding this check.

Therefore, the method directly related to this issue is the `submit_row` function. We need to analyze its content and logic to make sure it uses the permissions correctly.

Buggy method: `django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py:submit_row`

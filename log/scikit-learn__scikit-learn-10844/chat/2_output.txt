Analyzing the traceback and provided information, the runtime warning occurs due to overflow in integer arithmetic when computing `tk / np.sqrt(pk * qk)` within the `fowlkes_mallows_score` function. The main culprits are `pk * qk`, which exceed the limits for integer storage, causing the `np.sqrt` function to raise an overflow warning.

Now let us extract the relevant details from the traceback:
- `tk = np.dot(c.data, c.data) - n_samples`
- `pk = np.sum(np.asarray(c.sum(axis=0)).ravel() ** 2) - n_samples`
- `qk = np.sum(np.asarray(c.sum(axis=1)).ravel() ** 2) - n_samples`
- `tk / np.sqrt(pk * qk)` throws overflow warning

These assignments and operations are found in the `fowlkes_mallows_score` method within `sklearn/metrics/cluster/supervised.py`.

Since the observed buggy behavior stems directly from this method, let's identify it as the source of the issue:

Buggy method: `sklearn/metrics/cluster/supervised.py:fowlkes_mallows_score`

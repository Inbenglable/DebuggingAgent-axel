To resolve the issue, we need to modify the way headers are handled in the `request` method of the `Session` class. Currently, there seems to be no mechanism to skip headers with `None` values. 

To implement this, we'll need to ensure that when preparing the request, any headers with `None` values are removed before the request is sent. This will involve examining how headers are set and manipulated, particularly in the `Session.request` method and potentially the `prepare_request` method.

Since I have the code for the `request` method but need to understand how headers are processed or modified when preparing a request, specifically in the `prepare_request` method, I will retrieve the source code for the `prepare_request` method.

```python
search_method_in_file("requests/sessions.py", "Session.prepare_request")
```

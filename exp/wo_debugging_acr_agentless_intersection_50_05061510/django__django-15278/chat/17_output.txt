To determine whether the issue is resolved, we need to analyze the information provided:

1. **Issue Description:** The issue involves adding a nullable `OneToOneField` with a unique constraint using SQLite, which results in an `OperationalError` due to the limitations of SQLite's `ALTER TABLE` command.

2. **Original Test Output:** The original test output shows an `AttributeError` stating the inability to locate `OneToOneField` within `django.db.migrations`. This indicates a problem in how the test case is written rather than reproducing the actual reported issue.

3. **Patch Provided:** The patch aims to modify the `add_field` method in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py` to handle unique fields by recreating the table rather than using `ALTER TABLE`. This is a logical approach given SQLite's limitations.

4. **Patched Test Output:** The patched test output remains identical to the original. The error is still an `AttributeError`, which suggests that the test doesn't correctly reach the point where the patch would take effect because the error occurs before the migration logic is executed.

**Conclusion:**

The issue has not been resolved based on the test outputs because the `AttributeError` prevents the test from actually running the migration that the patch is intended to fix. This indicates a problem with the test setup rather than the patch itself. Therefore, we cannot determine the effectiveness of the patch in resolving the actual SQLite error related to adding a unique, nullable `OneToOneField`.

Issue resolved: `False`

The trace you've provided shows a failure when executing the `_cull` method, which is likely related to fetching the value after a SQL query execution resulting in `'NoneType' object is not subscriptable`.

In the provided test output, there is an error indicating `'DatabaseOperations' object has no attribute 'now'`. This implies that the test attempts to use the `now` method on a database operations object, which may not exist. However, this error is unrelated to the symptom described in the bug report regarding `cursor.fetchone()[0]`. 

The issue seems to be with the `_cull` method within the `django/core/cache/backends/db.py` file, particularly at the line where it tries to execute a SQL query and fetch a result (`cursor.fetchone()[0]`), which is causing the error when it doesn't return any rows.

Considering this information, I will need to inspect the `_cull` method specifically.

Observed method: `django/core/cache/backends/db.py:DatabaseCache._cull`

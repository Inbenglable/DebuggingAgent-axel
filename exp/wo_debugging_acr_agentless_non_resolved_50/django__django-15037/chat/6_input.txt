## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Foreign key to a specific field is not handled in inspectdb
Description
	 
		(last modified by Tim Graham)
	 
if you have a DB like that
CREATE TABLE foo ( id serial primary key, other_id int UNIQUE);
CREATE TABLE bar (
	id serial primary key, other_id int,
	constraint myconst 
	FOREIGN KEY(other_id) references foo(other_id)
);
the generated model for the bar table will have the other_id be a FK to foo and not foo(other_id).
I'm attaching a potential fix for this. Sorry I had no time for the UTs.

==================================================
Your Output:
To fix the issue related to `inspectdb` handling foreign keys to specific fields, I need to check the implementation of `inspectdb` functionality in Django's codebase. Specifically, I need to find where the models are created based on the database schema, which includes the handling of foreign keys. Therefore, I will need to search for the relevant source code that deals with model generation from a database.

I'm particularly interested in finding how fields, especially foreign keys, are handled and how their references are resolved during the inspection process. This could involve methods related to database introspection and schema conversion.

Thus, I will begin by searching for relevant methods, especially focusing on `inspectdb` functionality within Django's management commands. The file likely involved is `django/core/management/sql.py` or similar.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("inspectdb")
search_method_in_codebase("Field.foreign_key")
search_method_in_codebase("get_field_type")
```

==================================================

Your Output:
To address the issue of handling foreign keys to specific fields in the `inspectdb` management command, I need to inspect how the `Command.get_field_type` method is utilized and potentially modified to accommodate this foreign key reference issue. We've identified that `get_field_type` is located in `django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py`.

However, we also need to understand how foreign key constraints are introspected and translated into Django model fields, specifically how `inspectdb` manages these references. We should look into related methods or functions that could influence or manage the introspection of foreign keys beyond `get_field_type`.

I'll proceed by retrieving the source code for `Command.get_field_type` and potentially other related methods within the `inspectdb` file to better understand how to make the necessary adjustments.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py", "get_field_type")
search_method_in_file("django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py", "handle_inspection")
search_method_in_codebase("add_fk")
search_method_in_codebase("introspect")

==================================================

Your Output:
Based on the information retrieved, I've obtained the source code for the `Command.get_field_type` and `Command.handle_inspection` methods from `django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py`. The primary issue involves how `inspectdb` processes foreign keys, ensuring that they reference specific fields rather than defaulting to the primary key.

To resolve this, I should be prepared to modify how relationships are detected in the `handle_inspection` method, possibly using the detected constraints to differentiate which specific fields the foreign keys should reference. This means looking into how constraints and relations are currently processed and modifying the logic to account for the specific field targeted by the foreign key.

Since I've examined the necessary parts of the codebase to address the foreign key handling in the `inspectdb` process, I'm ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

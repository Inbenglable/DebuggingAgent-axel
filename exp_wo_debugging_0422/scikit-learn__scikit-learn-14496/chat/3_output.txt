Here is the patch to resolve the issue by ensuring that `min_samples` is converted to an integer before being used:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sklearn/cluster/optics_.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        min_samples = max(2, min_samples * n_samples)\n=======\n        min_samples = int(round(max(2, min_samples * n_samples)))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

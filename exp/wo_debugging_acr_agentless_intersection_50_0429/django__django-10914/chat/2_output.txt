To properly address the issue and make changes to the `FileSystemStorage` class, specifically regarding setting a default file upload permission, I need to understand how file permissions are being handled currently. The appropriate method to investigate would be `_save` in the `FileSystemStorage` class as it is likely responsible for saving files and potentially setting permissions. I will retrieve the source code for this method to understand its current handling of file permissions. 

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/files/storage.py", "FileSystemStorage._save")
```

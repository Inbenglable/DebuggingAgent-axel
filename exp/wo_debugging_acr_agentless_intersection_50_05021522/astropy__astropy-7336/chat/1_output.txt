To resolve this issue, it is important to modify the part of the code within the `quantity_input` decorator where it expects the return value to have the `to` method. We must verify if this part can handle `None` as a return value.

Since the error traceback references `/usr/lib64/python3.6/site-packages/astropy/units/decorators.py`, I need to examine this file to understand and modify the relevant logic for handling `NoneType` return values.

I will retrieve the source code of the relevant method inside the `decorators.py` file to proceed with analyzing the problem further.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/units/decorators.py", "wrapper")
```

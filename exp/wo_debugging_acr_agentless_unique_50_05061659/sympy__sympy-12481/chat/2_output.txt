To address the issue, I need to check the implementation of the `__new__` method in the `Permutation` class. This is likely where cycle inputs are processed, and modifications can be made to handle non-disjoint cycles correctly. 

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py", "Permutation.__new__")
```

To resolve the issue related to the `caplog` fixture not restoring the log level, I need to examine how the `caplog` fixture is implemented, particularly focusing on any methods related to setting and restoring log levels. Since I don't have the file path for where the `caplog` fixture is likely implemented, I need to search for this code in the codebase.

I'll start by searching for the `caplog` fixture which could be implemented as a function or part of a class. I'll look for the class or method likely responsible for handling the log level changes within the `caplog` fixture.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("caplog")
search_class_in_codebase("caplog")
```

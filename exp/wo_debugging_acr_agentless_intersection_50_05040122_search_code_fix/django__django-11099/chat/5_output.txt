I will create the correct patch to fix the issue where `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` allow trailing newlines in usernames. The patch will replace the existing regex with one using `\A` and `\Z` rather than `^` and `$`.

Here is the correct *SEARCH/REPLACE* patch:

```python
### django/contrib/auth/validators.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    regex = r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'
=======
    regex = r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This patch needs to be applied separately for both `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator`, but since they both contain the identical regex pattern, it will work correctly for both.

Now, I'll provide the JSON-encoded patch:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/auth/validators.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    regex = r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'\n=======\n    regex = r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch corrects the regex syntax issue to ensure trailing newlines are not allowed in usernames.

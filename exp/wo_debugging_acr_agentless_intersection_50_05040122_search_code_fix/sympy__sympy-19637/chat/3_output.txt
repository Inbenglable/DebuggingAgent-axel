In order to fix the issue regarding the 'kern' variable being referenced before assignment in the `kernS` function, we need to ensure that the variable `kern` is always initialized before being used. Based on the source code, it appears that the assignment of `kern` may not occur if certain conditions are not met, leading to the error.

Here's a patch that initializes `kern` as an empty string at the start of the function to ensure it never triggers an error for being uninitialized:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/core/sympify.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    import string\n=======\n    import string\n    kern = ''\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This modification should eliminate the 'kern' referenced before assignment error without changing the existing logic of the `kernS` function. The assignment ensures that the function execution does not lead to an uninitialized `kern` variable error.

To resolve the issue of adding DISTINCT support to Avg and Sum aggregates, we need to set these classes as allowing DISTINCT, similar to how it's implemented in the Count aggregate. For that, we introduce the `allow_distinct` attribute to both Avg and Sum classes.

Here's the patch in SEARCH/REPLACE format:

```pythony
### django/db/models/aggregates.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):
=======
class Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):
    allow_distinct = True
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```pythony
### django/db/models/aggregates.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):
=======
class Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):
    allow_distinct = True
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Here's the resulting JSON for the patch edits:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):\n=======\nclass Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):\n=======\nclass Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

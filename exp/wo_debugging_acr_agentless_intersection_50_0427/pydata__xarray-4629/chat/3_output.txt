Here's the patch to resolve the issue by ensuring that the attributes are copied rather than referenced:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### xarray/core/merge.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        return variable_attrs[0]\n=======\n        return dict(variable_attrs[0])\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
``` 

This patch modifies the code for the "override" case to return a new dictionary instead of a direct reference to the attributes, preventing unintended side-effects.

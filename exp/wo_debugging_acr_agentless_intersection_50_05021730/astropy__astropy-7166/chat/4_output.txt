I need to retrieve the complete implementation of the `InheritDocstrings` class to make sure that all relevant methods are captured, especially those using `inspect.isfunction`. So far, I've only retrieved partial information about how `inspect.isfunction` is used. Therefore, I need to specifically look for the methods of the `InheritDocstrings` class in its corresponding file to understand the complete logic.

```python
search_class_in_file("astropy/utils/misc.py", "InheritDocstrings")
```

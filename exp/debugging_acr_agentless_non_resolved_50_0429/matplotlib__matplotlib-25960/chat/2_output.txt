To address the issue, I first need to retrieve the source code of the `Figure.subfigures` method in the `matplotlib.figure` module. This will help me understand how `wspace` and `hspace` are currently being handled and why they are not affecting the layout as expected.

```python
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/figure.py", "Figure.subfigures")
```

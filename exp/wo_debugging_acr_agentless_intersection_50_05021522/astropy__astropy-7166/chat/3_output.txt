To resolve the issue, I need to understand the full implementation of the `InheritDocstrings` class, specifically the logic inside the `__init__` method or any relevant method, which is where the handling for `inspect.isfunction` might occur. Since I haven't yet retrieved this part of the class, I'll need to search for the `__init__` method or any relevant method that handles the docstrings in properties.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/utils/misc.py", "__init__")
search_method_in_file("astropy/utils/misc.py", "InheritDocstrings.some_relevant_method")  # Replace with actual methods if known
```

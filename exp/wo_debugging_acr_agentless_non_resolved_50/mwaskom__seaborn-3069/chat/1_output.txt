To address the described issue, we need to examine how `seaborn` currently handles categorical and nominal scales, particularly focusing on how the `Plotter._finalize_figure` method and any relevant scale-specific logic are implemented. The task suggests modifying the behavior for `Nominal` scales to align with the treatment of categorical scales, which includes axis margin settings, grid visibility, and axis inversion.

To proceed effectively, I need to:
1. Look at the implementation of the `Plotter._finalize_figure` method to understand how it finalizes plots, especially for categorical axes.
2. Explore any relevant classes or methods related to axis scale management that could influence how nominal scales are drawn.

I will start by searching for the `Plotter._finalize_figure` method within the `seaborn` codebase. Since there's also mention of adjustments regarding scale, it might be useful to look into `Nominal` or related scale classes, if they exist.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("Plotter._finalize_figure")
search_class_in_codebase("Nominal")
```

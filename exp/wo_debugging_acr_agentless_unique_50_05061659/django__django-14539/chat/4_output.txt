To resolve the issue where `urlize()` does not correctly handle HTML-escaped strings and trailing punctuation, we need to adjust the logic in `trim_punctuation`. Currently, it's processing trailing characters incorrectly, which causes the problematic output.

Let's examine and adjust the logic of handling trailing punctuation correctly.

Below are the suggested patches:

```pythony
### django/utils/html.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                middle = middle[:len(stripped) - len(middle_unescaped)]
=======
                middle = middle[:len(stripped)]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The incorrect part in the `trim_punctuation` logic was the subtraction involving `middle_unescaped`. We should simply slice `middle` to match `stripped` without the additional calculation error.

Now, let's provide the edit result in JSON format.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/utils/html.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                middle = middle[:len(stripped) - len(middle_unescaped)]\n=======\n                middle = middle[:len(stripped)]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

To fix the issue with the `_check_homomorphism` method related to the handling of inverted generators, I need to review the source code of this function first, along with the `_image()` function mentioned. This will help in understanding the current implementation and identifying where the simplification and fix can be applied. 

I'll start by searching for `_check_homomorphism` in the `homomorphisms.py` file since the error message and the issue is related to this context.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py", "_check_homomorphism")
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py", "_image")
```

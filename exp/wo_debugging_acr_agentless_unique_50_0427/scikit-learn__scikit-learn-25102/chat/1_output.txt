To resolve this issue, I need to review the relevant parts of the scikit-learn codebase, particularly related to the transformation mechanisms and pandas integration. The issue mentions the `_SetOutputMixin`, `_wrap_in_pandas_container`, and `_wrap_data_with_container`. I will search for these components to examine and understand how they work currently and how they should be modified to preserve the dtypes.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("_SetOutputMixin")
search_method_in_codebase("_wrap_in_pandas_container")
search_method_in_codebase("_wrap_data_with_container")
```

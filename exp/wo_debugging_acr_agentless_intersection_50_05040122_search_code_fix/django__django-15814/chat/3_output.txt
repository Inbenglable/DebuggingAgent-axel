To fix the issue properly, I need to understand the context in which the snippet `opts = cur_model._meta` is being used. Specifically, I need to know which method this code is part of in the file `django/db/models/sql/query.py`. I will retrieve the surrounding method to understand where to apply the patch.

```python
search_code_in_file("django/db/models/sql/query.py", "opts = cur_model._meta")
```

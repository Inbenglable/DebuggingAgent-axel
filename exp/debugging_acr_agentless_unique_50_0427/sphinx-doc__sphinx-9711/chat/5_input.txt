needs_extensions checks versions using strings
### Describe the bug

The `needs_extensions` check is handy for verifying minimum extension versions, but it only checks versions in a 'string-like' manner. This means any version >9 is not allowed for any check of something >1. That is, treated as string '0.6' > '0.10', but treated as versions '0.6' < '0.10'. Since Sphinx does the former, some extension versions may not be allowed when they should be.

### How to Reproduce

```
$ git clone https://github.com/anntzer/mplcursors
$ cd mplcursors
$ pip install -r .doc-requirements.txt
$ pip install -e .
$ make -C doc html
```
This passes just fine, because the requirements pin sphinx-gallery to 0.9. But if you then update to the current 0.10 release:

```
$ pip install sphinx-gallery==0.10
$ make -C doc html
```
results in a failure due to a "not new enough" version:
```
Running Sphinx v4.1.2
loading translations [en]... done
making output directory... done

Sphinx version error:
This project needs the extension sphinx_gallery.gen_gallery at least in version 0.6.0 and therefore cannot be built with the loaded version (0.10.0).
```

### Expected behavior

sphinx-gallery 0.10.0 should be accepted if 0.6 is the minimum specified.

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
The issue here arises from how version checks are executed as string comparisons rather than semantic version comparisons. Consequently, any version greater than 9 (for example, '0.10.0') would be considered smaller than '0.6.0' if compared as strings, causing incorrect assertions to fail as seen in the error traceback.

In the provided script, the version check is performed within the function `check_extension_version`. This is where a string comparison occurs:

```python
if required_version > actual_version:
    raise AssertionError(...)
```

To resolve this, we need to make sure version strings are compared numerically according to semantic versioning. Generally, this can be accomplished through utilities like `packaging.version` in Python.

Since the error points directly to this line as the root cause, we likely need to modify the `check_extension_version` method to perform proper semantic version comparison.

Therefore, the buggy method is:

Buggy method: `reproduce.py:check_extension_version`
==================================================


Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

You need to trace the abnormal program to resolve project issues and submit pull requests.
Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Add transaction handling to Changelist list_editable processing.
Description
	
It seems that changelist_view in Django admin is missing a transaction. Since the view may change data in database, it should be wrapped in a transaction to prevent unexpected states in case of errors.

</ISSUE>


Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
import os
import sys
import traceback
from django.core.management import call_command
from django.test import TestCase
from django.db import transaction
from django.contrib import admin
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from myapp.models import MyModel  # Adjust the import according to your project structure

# Function to print stack trace
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Set up Django environment
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'myproject.settings')  # Adjust the settings module according to your project

django.setup()

# Create a test case to simulate the issue
class ChangelistViewTransactionTest(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        # Create a superuser for admin access
        self.user = User.objects.create_superuser('admin', 'admin@example.com', 'password')
        self.client.login(username='admin', password='password')
        # Create some initial data

        url = '/admin/myapp/mymodel/'
        data = {
            'action': 'change',
            '_selected_action': [str(obj.pk) for obj in MyModel.objects.all()],
            'name': 'Updated Data',
        }
        try:
            # Simulate the changelist view without transaction handling
            response = self.client.post(url, data)
            # Simulate an error to trigger the transaction issue
            raise Exception("Simulated error to test transaction handling")
        except Exception as e:
            # Check if the changes were rolled back
            mymodel_instance = MyModel.objects.first()
            if mymodel_instance.name == 'Updated Data':
                print_stacktrace(e)
                raise AssertionError("Transaction handling is missing: changes were not rolled back.")
            else:
                print("Transaction handling is present: changes were rolled back.")
                sys.exit(0)

# Run the test

    call_command('makemigrations', interactive=False)

This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
The error log indicates an `ImproperlyConfigured` error due to accessing Django settings before they're properly configured. The issue arises when accessing the setting `INSTALLED_APPS`, which suggests that the Django settings have not been initialized with `os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'myproject.settings')` or some other method of configuring the settings.

This problem is occurring early in the script execution, likely because the settings are not set up before importing certain Django components that need them (like models or admin classes). Specifically, the imports begin to fail when attempting to import `User` from `django.contrib.auth.models`, as this action seems to rely on the settings being ready.

To further diagnose and confirm the issue, let's analyze whether the method involving the configuration check is somehow being prematurely triggered. We will trace the execution beginning at this crucial point to see any further details that indicate how the settings are being accessed or what imports occur beforehand.

Observed method: `django/conf/__init__.py:_setup`
==================================================


Now you choose downstream method LazySettings._setup to further observe, tracing the abnormal program behavior.
This is the method code:
    63	    def _setup(self, name=None):
    64	        """
    65	        Load the settings module pointed to by the environment variable. This
    66	        is used the first time settings are needed, if the user hasn't
    67	        configured settings manually.
    68	        """
    69	        settings_module = os.environ.get(ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE)
    70	        if not settings_module:
    71	            desc = ("setting %s" % name) if name else "settings"
    72	            raise ImproperlyConfigured(
    73	                "Requested %s, but settings are not configured. "
    74	                "You must either define the environment variable %s "
    75	                "or call settings.configure() before accessing settings."
    76	                % (desc, ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE)
    77	            )
    78	
    79	        self._wrapped = Settings(settings_module)


This is the runtime information of LazySettings._setup:

You need to trace the abnormal program behavior step by step to identify the root cause of the bug and locate the buggy method that contains the code to be fixed.
Now, please first analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior. 

Then, if you can already locate the buggy method and buggy code, reply with:  
Buggy method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Otherwise, continue tracing by telling me the code line scope that you want to deeper observe, we will show you the deeper downstream run-time information of the scope you select. Please reply with:
Observed scope: `{FILE_PATH}:{START_LOC}-{END_LOC}`
Note that {FILE_PATH} refers to the path relative to the repository.

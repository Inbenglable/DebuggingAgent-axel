I need to retrieve the source code for the `Documenter.filter_members` method in order to generate the patch. This method is responsible for filtering which members should be documented, and currently it lacks the logic to respect the `__all__` attribute when it's empty.

To proceed, I'll search for the `Documenter.filter_members` method in the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py", "Documenter.filter_members")
```

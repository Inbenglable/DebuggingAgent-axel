Based on the code retrieved, it seems we need to modify the `Aggregate` class to allow DISTINCT operations. Since all the aggregates subclass `Aggregate`, we can add DISTINCT support by setting the `allow_distinct` attribute to `True` in the `Avg`, `Sum`, `Min`, and `Max` classes.

The `Aggregate` class already has the `distinct` parameter in its `__init__` method and uses a template string to handle it. We now need to make sure that `Avg`, `Sum`, `Min`, and `Max` override the `allow_distinct` attribute to `True`.

Since we have enough information on the implementation, especially the `Aggregate` class, we're ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

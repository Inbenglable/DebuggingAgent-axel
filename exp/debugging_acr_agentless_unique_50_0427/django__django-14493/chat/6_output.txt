Based on the analysis of the issue and the search results indicating the relevant portions of the `post_process` method and the `substitutions` variable, I have gathered sufficient information to generate the patch. The core problem stems from referencing `substitutions` before it is guaranteed to be assigned a value, which happens if the loop it is supposed to be assigned in is not entered.

To resolve this, we should ensure `substitutions` is initialized at the start of the method.

Ready generation: `True`

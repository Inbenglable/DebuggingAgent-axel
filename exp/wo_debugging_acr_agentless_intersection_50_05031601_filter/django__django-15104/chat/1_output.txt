To resolve the issue, I need to make a modification in the `only_relation_agnostic_fields` method within the `MigrationAutodetector` class, where the highlighted code (`del deconstruction[2]['to']`) resides. I will retrieve the necessary source code for this method to understand its context and make the required changes.

Let's search for the `only_relation_agnostic_fields` method in the codebase to ensure we have its full implementation:

```python
search_method_in_codebase("MigrationAutodetector.only_relation_agnostic_fields")
```

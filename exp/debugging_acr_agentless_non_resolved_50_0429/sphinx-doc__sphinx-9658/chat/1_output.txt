The current abnormal program behavior indicates a problem with module import. The script attempts to import the `sphinx_autodoc_typehints` module, which apparently isn't installed in the environment where the script is being executed, leading to a `ModuleNotFoundError`.

This problem isn't directly related to the core issue reported ("Inherited classes not correctly documented when mocked"). However, to diagnose the main problem with Sphinx documentation mentioned in the issue, we must resolve this dependency issue first.

Here's how to proceed:

1. **Resolve the missing dependency**: Make sure that `sphinx_autodoc_typehints` is installed in your environment. You can do this by running `pip install sphinx-autodoc-typehints`.

2. **Re-run the script**: After ensuring all dependencies are installed, re-run the script to trigger the main issue described (related to incorrect documentation of inherited classes).

Without resolving this dependency problem first, debugging the main issue or identifying potential methods involved would be premature.

At this stage, a trace of faulty method coding is not possible due to the dependency issue. Once this is resolved, further observation and debugging can proceed.

Please install `sphinx-autodoc-typehints` and rerun the test. After addressing this import error, observations can proceed with methods related to the documentation of inherited classes in the Sphinx framework.

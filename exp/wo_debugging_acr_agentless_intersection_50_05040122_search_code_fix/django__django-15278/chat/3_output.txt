To address this issue, it's necessary to modify the behavior of adding a nullable `OneToOneField` with a unique constraint in the SQLite backend. As seen, the `add_field` method from `DatabaseSchemaEditor` in the SQLite backend directly remakes the table if the field is not nullable and has a default value. This occurs in the file `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py`.

Since it's essential to understand how this method can be adjusted to prevent the crash when adding a nullable unique column, I need to further retrieve the full source code for the `SQLiteSchemaEditor.add_field` method. 

Additionally, understanding how `_remake_table` impacts this could also be useful, so if feasible, I will search for its code as well.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py", "DatabaseSchemaEditor.add_field")
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py", "_remake_table")
```

To resolve the issue with the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass not working for properties, I need to adjust the current implementation so that it also covers properties, not just functions. The current code uses `inspect.isfunction` which doesn't handle properties. I should also check for `inspect.isdatadescriptor` to handle properties.

I have sufficient information from the approach in `__init__` method of `InheritDocstrings`, focusing on detecting public members and inheriting docstrings from super methods.

Ready generation: `True`

The issue arises because the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass checks only if a class attribute is a function using `inspect.isfunction`, but properties are not recognized as functions by this check. Therefore, the method needs to be adjusted to also account for properties when inheriting docstrings.

I have gathered the `__init__` method of the `InheritDocstrings` class, which is where the relevant logic for inheriting docstrings is defined.

I can address the issue by modifying this method to include a check for properties using `inspect.isdatadescriptor` which recognizes properties, and then assign their docstring similarly as done for functions.

This means I have enough information to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

Based on the observed code and runtime information, the `FileInput` class itself, as seen from lines 374 to 387, does not currently have a `use_required_attribute()` method. This is consistent with the issue raised, where `ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute()` should potentially be moved or adapted for `FileInput`.

Given that the immediate task is to ensure `FileInput` behaves correctly when initial data is present, we would need to establish a way for it to determine if the 'required' attribute is necessary, much like how `ClearableFileInput` already does.

The runtime error regarding the test execution indicates that there is an issue with the setup of the test environment being called multiple times, which needs addressing but isn't directly impacting the behavior of the `FileInput` class regarding the 'required' attribute.

Now, to proceed with identifying where the logic needs to be modified or introduced, I'll need to look further into the `ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute()` method to understand how it determines the necessity of the 'required' attribute and how we might introduce similar logic into `FileInput`.

Observed scope: `django/forms/widgets.py:454-470`

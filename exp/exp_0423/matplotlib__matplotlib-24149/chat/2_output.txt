Based on the traceback and the description of the bug, it looks like the issue is occurring within the `Axes.bar` method when it encounters data that contains only NaN values. The traceback indicates that the problem arises from the `_safe_first_finite` function, which is called from within the `_convert_dx` method of the `Axes` class.

The key part of the traceback is:

```
File ~/miniconda/envs/py310/lib/python3.10/site-packages/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py:2182, in Axes._convert_dx
    2182 x0 = cbook._safe_first_finite(x0)
```

Since this function is attempting to find the first finite value from the input data, and because the input in this case is entirely NaN, a `StopIteration` exception is raised. This indicates that the method `_safe_first_finite` does not handle the case of inputs that are entirely NaN.

Given this information, the next step is to trace into the `_safe_first_finite` function to understand why it does not handle completely NaN arrays, which ultimately leads to the `StopIteration` error.

Observed method: `lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py:_safe_first_finite`

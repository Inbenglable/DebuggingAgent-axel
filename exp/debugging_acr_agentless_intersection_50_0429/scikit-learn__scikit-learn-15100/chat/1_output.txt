The issue lies in the `strip_accents_unicode` function of the `scikit-learn` library, particularly within the file that defines it. The function is intended to strip accents from strings, but it fails for strings already normalized in NFKD form when these strings contain combining characters, as shown in the issue description and the reproduced test.

To resolve the issue, we need to ensure that the function is correctly handling this specific case.

Currently, the observed program behavior confirms that the function returns the string unchanged if it is already in normalized form (NFKD in this case), without considering combining characters explicitly. This case is handled by the condition:

```python
if normalized == s: 
    return s 
```

This means if the input string `s` is equal to its normalized form, then the function simply returns it, which is not sufficient when the input has combining characters. 

Therefore, the issue can be traced back to how the `strip_accents_unicode` processes or ignores combining marks in the NFKD normalized string.

Observed method: `sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py:strip_accents_unicode`

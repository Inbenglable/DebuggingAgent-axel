To resolve the issue, I need to review the source code of the `Avg` and `Sum` classes in the `django/db/models/aggregates.py` file to understand their current structure and how to modify them to support the DISTINCT parameter. Thus, I need to retrieve the source code for these classes.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Avg")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Sum")
```

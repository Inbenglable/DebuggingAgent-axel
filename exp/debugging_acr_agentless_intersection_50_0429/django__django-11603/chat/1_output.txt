The error message clearly indicates that an attempt was made to use Django models before the application registry was fully initialized. This usually happens when model definitions or database operations are performed prior to calling Django's setup functions correctly.

The exception `django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet.` is raised when trying to access the app registry before it has been properly initialized. In this case, the issue seems to stem from configuring Django settings and defining models in a script that is executed as a standalone program. The settings may not have been properly loaded, and Django's application registry may not have been bootstrapped yet.

To resolve this particular issue, we must ensure that the Django settings are fully loaded and Django's application registry is ready before executing any operations related to models or database commands.

Given the stack trace and execution flow of your script, the main area to investigate further would be the configuration/startup sequence of the script.

Observed method: `django/apps/registry.py:check_apps_ready`

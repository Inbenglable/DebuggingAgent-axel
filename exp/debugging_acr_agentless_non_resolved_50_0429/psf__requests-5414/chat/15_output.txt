To determine whether the patch resolves the issue, let's review the changes and analyze the test outputs before and after applying the patch.

### Patch Analysis
The patch modifies the `requests/adapters.py` file to catch an additional exception, `LocationParseError`, alongside `LocationValueError`, and raise a `requests.exceptions.InvalidURL` for both exceptions. This change is meant to handle the given test input (`http://.example.com`) by raising the expected `InvalidURL` exception when such an invalid URL is encountered.

### Test Output Analysis

#### Original Output
The original test output indicates that a `urllib3.exceptions.LocationParseError` was raised due to the invalid URL, causing an `AssertionError` in the testing script stating "An unexpected exception was raised."

#### Patched Output
The patched output shows the same flow as the original, with a `urllib3.exceptions.LocationParseError` being raised and the resultant `AssertionError`. This indicates that despite the patch, the `InvalidURL` exception — expected as per the issue description — is still not being raised.

### Conclusion
Given the similar behavior of the outputs before and after patching, where the `InvalidURL` exception was not raised as expected, the issue remains unresolved.

Therefore, the final verdict is:

Issue resolved: `False`

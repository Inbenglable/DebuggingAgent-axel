In order to resolve the issue, we need to examine how the multiplication of a `geometry.Point` by a number is handled. Let's search for the `__mul__` method within the `Point` class to understand its behavior. This will help us in ensuring that both operations (`point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` and `sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2`) behave consistently.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/geometry/point.py", "Point.__mul__")
```

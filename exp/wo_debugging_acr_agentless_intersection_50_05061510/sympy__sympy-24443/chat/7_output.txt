To resolve the issue, I need to review the surrounding code of the `_check_homomorphism` method, especially focusing on the `_image` function extracted from the previous search. Understanding the behavior and patterns for handling permutation groups within this method is crucial.

Now, to generate the patch, I have enough information about the `_check_homomorphism` method and its usage of the `_image` function, which was causing the issue due to the inverted generator aspect within permutation groups.

Given this, I'm now ready to generate the patch without needing further code retrieval.

Ready generation: `True`

## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
sylow_subgroup() IndexError 
I use sympy 1.6.1, with numpy 1.18.5, scipy 1.4.1, under Python '3.8.5 (default, Aug  5 2020, 09:44:06) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)]'. 

The code that I run as the following gives IndexError for sylow_subgroup():

from sympy.combinatorics import DihedralGroup, PermutationGroup, Permutation

G = DihedralGroup(18)

S2 = G.sylow_subgroup(p=2)
 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<input>", line 7, in <module>
  File "D:\anaconda38\envs\default\lib\site-packages\sympy\combinatorics\perm_groups.py", line 4370, in sylow_subgroup
    blocks = self.minimal_blocks()
  File "D:\anaconda38\envs\default\lib\site-packages\sympy\combinatorics\perm_groups.py", line 2207, in minimal_blocks
    del num_blocks[i], blocks[i]
IndexError: list assignment index out of range

The same error shows up as well when I set: 
G = DihedralGroup(2*25)

S2 = G.sylow_subgroup(p=2)

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
The issue stems from the `sylow_subgroup` method in the SymPy library, specifically when it calls `self.minimal_blocks()`. The traceback shows that the exception occurs in the `minimal_blocks()` function of the `perm_groups.py` file. Here is the structured analysis to address the problem:

### Analyzing Current Observed Code:

1. **Execution Context**:
   - The test case attempts to generate a Sylow subgroup for `p=2` from a Dihedral group `G = DihedralGroup(18)`.

2. **Trace Segments**:
   - The `sylow_subgroup()` method eventually calls `minimal_blocks()`.
   - The exception occurs at a line attempting to delete elements from lists: `del num_blocks[i], blocks[i]`.

3. **Nature of Exception**:
   - `IndexError: list assignment index out of range` indicates an attempt to delete an element from a list using an index that does not exist.
   - The problem likely results from either the lists `num_blocks` or `blocks` having fewer elements than expected.

The focus now shifts to understanding how `minimal_blocks()` processes its inputs and manipulates its internal lists.

### Next Step:

To get a better insight, we should look into the `minimal_blocks()` method of `perm_groups.py` to trace its internal logic and see why the lists are shorter than expected or why the invalid index accesses occur.

Therefore, the next method to observe for root cause analysis is:

Observed method: `sympy/combinatorics/perm_groups.py:PermutationGroup.minimal_blocks`
==================================================
### Analysis of Current Observed Code and Abnormal Program Behavior:

1. **Purpose of `minimal_blocks()` Method:**
   - Returns the list of all minimal block systems for a transitive group.
   - If a group is intransitive, it returns `False`.

2. **Key Components of Code:**
   - **Randomization and Stabilization:** The method computes orbits using either random generators (if randomized) or a normal stabilizer.
   - **Block Identification:** For each orbit, a minimal block is computed, numbered, and checked for minimality relative to existing blocks.
   - **Delete Logic:** Within a loop, the method deletes elements from `blocks` and `num_blocks` using indices, if certain conditions are met (`del num_blocks[i], blocks[i]`).

3. **Problematic Section (Potential Cause of `IndexError`):**
   - The deletion logic (`del num_blocks[i], blocks[i]`) within the loop handling `rep_blocks` presents a risk of index errors.
   - `to_remove` accumulates blocks to delete but the actual modification to `rep_blocks` is done at line 2208 which may not correctly reflect earlier deletions in `num_blocks` and `blocks`.

4. **Nature of Exception:**
   - The `IndexError: list assignment index out of range` exception suggests attempting list modifications using indices that don't exist after previous modifications in the same loop.
   - There might be mismatched manipulation between list `num_blocks`, `blocks`, and `rep_blocks`.

Now that we understand the method's goal and the suspect lines, we need to trace further into the loop segment dealing with the deletion logic to confirm the nature of this mismatch.

### Next Step:

We need to focus on the scope within the loop where block manipulations occur, specifically the lines involved with `rep_blocks`, `num_blocks`, and `blocks`.

#### Selected Scope for Deeper Observation:
```plaintext
Observed scope: sympy/combinatorics/perm_groups.py:2198-2213
```

This scope covers the internal logic that actively modifies and assesses minimality, ultimately leading to list deletions. This will help identify the exact flow leading to `IndexError`.
==================================================
Based on the trace and analysis done so far, here is a deeper understanding of the current problem and the behavior observed:

### Current Observed Code and Abnormal Program Behavior:

#### Problematic Code:
```python
for i, r in enumerate(rep_blocks):
    if len(r) > len(rep) and rep.issubset(r):
        # i-th block system is not minimal
        del num_blocks[i], blocks[i]
        to_remove.append(rep_blocks[i])
    elif len(r) < len(rep) and r.issubset(rep):
        # the system being checked is not minimal
        minimal = False
        break

# remove non-minimal representative blocks
rep_blocks = [r for r in rep_blocks if r not in to_remove]

if minimal and num_block not in num_blocks:
    blocks.append(block)
    num_blocks.append(num_block)
    rep_blocks.append(rep)
```

#### Potential Problems:
- **Enumeration Over `rep_blocks`:** 
  - The issue arises from deleting elements from `num_blocks` and `blocks` within a loop that enumerates over `rep_blocks`. This enumeration sequence could cause discrepancies when elements from lists are removed in the same iteration.
- **Index Mismatch:** 
  - The mismatch occurs when indices referred to in the loop no longer align with elements in `num_blocks` and `blocks` due to removals within the loop leading to an `IndexError`.
  
#### Observed Issue:
The mismatch between the indexing of `rep_blocks` and other lists (`blocks`, `num_blocks`) is leading to improper deletions.

### Conclusion:
The issue arises due to index misalignment when deleting elements from `num_blocks` and `blocks` during list enumeration in `minimal_blocks`. The method is not handling the list index adjustments required after element deletions, leading to an `IndexError`.

This code snippet is the right location to address the bug, but adjustments are needed in handling list deletions and index referencing.

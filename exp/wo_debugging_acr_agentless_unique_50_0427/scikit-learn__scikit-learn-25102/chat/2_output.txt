I need to retrieve more source code in order to generate the patch. Specifically, I need to examine the entire `_SetOutputMixin` class, as well as the `_wrap_in_pandas_container` and `_wrap_data_with_container` methods in detail to determine where and how dtypes can be preserved during transformation.

```python
search_class_in_file("sklearn/utils/_set_output.py", "_SetOutputMixin")
search_method_in_file("sklearn/utils/_set_output.py", "_wrap_in_pandas_container")
search_method_in_file("sklearn/utils/_set_output.py", "_wrap_data_with_container")
```

Here is the patch to resolve the issue of adding DISTINCT support for the Avg and Sum aggregates in Django:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):\n=======\nclass Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):\n=======\nclass Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Min(Aggregate):\n=======\nclass Min(Aggregate):\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Max(Aggregate):\n=======\nclass Max(Aggregate):\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

These changes set the `allow_distinct` attribute to `True` for the `Avg`, `Sum`, `Min`, and `Max` classes. This will enable these aggregates to handle DISTINCT operations as required by the issue description.

To determine which returned contents are relevant, we need to assess which files directly relate to how Django handles file uploads and temporary file permissions with `NamedTemporaryFile`. Specifically, we want to identify places where file permissions might be set or affected by the use of `NamedTemporaryFile`.

Here is the analysis of each returned content:

1. **reproduce.py:32-38**: Demonstrates creating a large file with `NamedTemporaryFile`, potentially relevant due to file creation process.
2. **tests/gis_tests/geoapp/tests.py:191-197**: Writes and reads to a temporary file, not directly related to file upload permissions.
3. **tests/gis_tests/gdal_tests/test_raster.py:484-490**: Creates a temporary file for raster data, not related to file uploading.
4. **tests/admin_views/tests.py:3875-3881**: Uses `NamedTemporaryFile` for testing admin views, not related to file uploads.
5. **tests/test_client/tests.py:824-830**: Tests client-side upload with `NamedTemporaryFile`, relevant to file upload handling.
6. **tests/logging_tests/tests.py:533-539**: Deals with log file configuration, not related to file uploads.
7. **tests/view_tests/tests/test_debug.py:166-172**: Concerned with template loading, not file uploads.
8. **tests/i18n/test_extraction.py:406-412**: Manages extraction files, not directly relevant to uploads.
9. **tests/files/tests.py:66-72**: Temporary file attributes testing, indirectly related to file handling but not specifically uploads.
10. **tests/responses/test_fileresponse.py:56-62**: Deals with file responses, not creation/upload.
11. **tests/file_uploads/tests.py:434-440**: Directly tests file uploads with `NamedTemporaryFile`, relevant.
12. **tests/template_tests/test_loaders.py:186-192**: Tests template loader errors, irrelevant.
13. **tests/fixtures/tests.py:476-482**: Fixture file management, irrelevant.
14. **django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py:39-45**: PostgreSQL backend configuration, not file upload.
15. **django/core/management/commands/makemessages.py:555-561**: Handles message file creation, irrelevant.
16. **django/core/files/uploadedfile.py:58-64**: Involves `NamedTemporaryFile` in file uploading, directly relevant.
17. **django/core/files/temp.py:69-74**: Defines `NamedTemporaryFile` for Django's temporary file handling, relevant context.

Based on this analysis, the contents relevant to the issue of file upload permissions are:

```
reproduce.py:32-38
tests/test_client/tests.py:824-830
tests/file_uploads/tests.py:434-440
django/core/files/uploadedfile.py:58-64
django/core/files/temp.py:69-74
```

These files provide insight into how `NamedTemporaryFile` is used in the context of file uploads and are necessary for understanding and resolving the permission issue.

To address the issue related to `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension()`, I need to examine the source code of the `SI` class and specifically the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method in the Sympy project. Since the file path is not provided, I'll search for the method and class codebase-wide to locate and retrieve the required source code.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("SI")
search_method_in_codebase("SI._collect_factor_and_dimension")
```

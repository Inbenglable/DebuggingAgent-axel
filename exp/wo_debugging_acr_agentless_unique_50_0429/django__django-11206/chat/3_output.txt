I have retrieved the source code for the `format` method in `django.utils.numberformat` and have analyzed its implementation. From this, I understand how the method currently handles small decimal numbers by converting them to exponential notation when their length exceeds a cutoff.

I now have enough information to generate a patch for the issue as described. 

Ready generation: `True`

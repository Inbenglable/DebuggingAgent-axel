The error message `TypeError: Invalid comparison of complex I` indicates that there's a problem comparing complex numbers in the `fu.py` file, specifically within the `_futrig` function as it processes the expression. The function `simplify` eventually leads to the `trigsimp` function and then `futrig`, which utilizes other functions like `_futrig` and `_TR56`.

From the traceback and error details, the key suspect piece of code is the line in the `_futrig` function where there's an attempt to evaluate an expression involving exponentiation and comparison with complex numbers (specifically the imaginary unit `I`). The issue arises from a line attempting to check if an expression `rv.exp` is less than zero using `if (rv.exp < 0) == True:` in `fu.py`.

The provided test script indicates a Python exception `NameError: name 'I' is not defined`, which is separate from the `TypeError` but is important for testing. The real issue is within Sympy itself, centering around complex number handling in simplification steps.

Let's observe the method `_futrig`, as it seems directly linked to the triggering of the error due to invalid comparison operations related to complex numbers.

Observed method: `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py:_futrig`

Based on the information gathered about the `Avg`, `Sum`, and `Count` classes, we have a good understanding of what is required to add DISTINCT support to the `Avg` and `Sum` aggregates. 

Here's a summary of the required modifications:
- The `allow_distinct` attribute, which is already present in the `Count` class, should also be added to both the `Avg` and `Sum` classes.
- We should ensure these changes enable the aggregates to support the DISTINCT functionality correctly.

Since the source code for the `Avg` and `Sum` classes is straightforward, and we have a model for DISTINCT implementation in the `Count` class, we are ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

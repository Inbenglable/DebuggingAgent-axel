autodoc: empty __all__ attribute is ignored
**Describe the bug**
autodoc: empty `__all__` attribute is ignored

**To Reproduce**
```
# example.py
__all__ = []


def foo():
    "docstring"


def bar():
    "docstring"


def baz():
    "docstring"
```
```
# index.rst
.. automodule:: example
   :members:
```

All foo, bar, and baz are shown.

**Expected behavior**
No entries should be shown because `__all__` is empty.

**Your project**
No

**Screenshots**
No

**Environment info**
- OS: Mac
- Python version: 3.9.1
- Sphinx version: HEAD of 3.x
- Sphinx extensions: sphinx.ext.autodoc
- Extra tools: No

**Additional context**
No

==================================================
Your Output:
To address the issue with the autodoc extension of Sphinx, we need to verify how autodoc processes the `__all__` attribute within a module. Considering the description, it seems autodoc is not respecting an empty `__all__` list, which should exclude all functions from documentation. It is likely handled by specific methods or logic within the autodoc extension source code.

I will need to explore the autodoc extension source code in order to understand how the `__all__` attribute is currently processed. This typically involves looking at the module starting point in the autodoc extension where it defines its functionality. Additionally, to troubleshoot the issue, I'll search for the relevant code handling `__all__`.

Let's proceed with searching for the relevant source code in Sphinx's autodoc extension that deals with the `__all__` attribute processing.

```python
search_code_in_codebase("__all__")
```

            raise ValueError(__all__)

                    return self.__all__.index(name)
                else:
                    return len(self.__all__)
            documenters.sort(key=keyfunc)

            return documenters
```

#### sphinx/ext/autodoc/mock.py:83-89
```python

    def __init__(self, name: str) -> None:
        super().__init__(name)
        self.__all__ = []  # type: List[str]
        self.__path__ = []  # type: List[str]

    def __getattr__(self, name: str) -> _MockObject:
```


==================================================

Your Output:
To resolve the issue, it's important to understand how the autodoc extension in Sphinx handles the `__all__` attribute. From the information retrieved:

1. `sphinx/util/inspect.py`: Contains logic that checks if `__all__` is a list or tuple of strings and raises a ValueError otherwise.
  
2. `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`: Handles sorting of documenters based on their presence in `__all__`.
  
3. `sphinx/ext/autodoc/mock.py`: Demonstrates initialization of `__all__` as an empty list inside a mock class.

The next step is to investigate how autodoc processes module members and utilizes the `__all__` attribute. The goal is to ensure `__all__` is respected even when it's empty by potentially adjusting the logic found in these source files.

I'll search for how autodoc decides which members to include by looking for related methods in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`.

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py", "sort")
search_method_in_file("sphinx/util/inspect.py", "return __all__")
search_method_in_file("sphinx/ext/autodoc/mock.py", "__getattr__")
```

```python
    def __getattr__(self, name: str) -> _MockObject:
        return _make_subclass(name, self.__name__)()

```


==================================================

Your Output:
To address the issue, we need to examine how the `autodoc` extension processes the `__all__` attribute. Based on the search results, the relevant logic seems to be in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`. To apply a fix, it would be useful to understand how autodoc currently processes members and potentially changes logic that considers an empty `__all__`. To proceed, I need to review the relevant functions or classes in the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file that relate to member inclusion decisions, especially examining the context in which `__all__` is utilized.

search_method_in_file("sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py", "Documenter.import_object")

==================================================

Your Output:
Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

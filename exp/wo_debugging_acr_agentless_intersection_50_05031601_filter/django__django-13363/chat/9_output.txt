The test output before and after the patch indicates that the same error persists: the test fails due to an `OperationalError` with the message "no such table: __main___timeslots". This suggests that the patch hasn't been tested properly since the table required for conducting the test wasn't created in the first place. Consequently, it's not possible to determine whether the patch successfully resolves the original issue based solely on the available test output.

Additionally, examining the patch, the change appears logically correct. The `tzinfo` parameter is correctly prioritized over the default timezone, which aligns with the issue description. However, these logical changes cannot be validated against the test outputs shared.

Therefore, with the current information, the conclusion regarding the resolution of the issue is based on faulty test setup, not the patch functionality itself.

Issue resolved: `False`

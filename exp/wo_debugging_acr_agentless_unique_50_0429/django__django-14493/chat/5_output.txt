Based on the information gathered, I've recognized that I need to retrieve the source code of the `post_process` method within the `StaticFilesStorage` class from the `django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py` file to fully understand the relation with the `substitutions` variable and address the issue accurately. This will help in deciding the accurate fix for the `UnboundLocalError`.

I'll conduct further searches to locate the necessary code, due to previous results not showing the `post_process` in the given context.
  
```python
search_class_in_file("django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py", "StaticFilesStorage")
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py", "post_process")
```

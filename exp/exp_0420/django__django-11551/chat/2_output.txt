The output indicates an issue when trying to populate the `INSTALLED_APPS` with `test_app`, which does not exist, leading to a `ModuleNotFoundError`. 

The key problem revolves around Django's admin checks for `list_display`, where certain fields are incorrectly flagged as errors in newer versionsâ€”specifically the `PositionField`. The provided code example for testing the admin E108 error isn't running correctly due to the missing `test_app`.

The notable points include:
- The use of `getattr` and `_meta.get_field` for validation in `_check_list_display_item`.
- The linked commit and rationale for change, which introduced a regression for certain field types due to the omitted `hasattr` checks and `get_field` dependency.

I need to review the `_check_list_display_item` logic, as the issue stems from there.

Next, I will trace through how Django validates fields in `list_display` for fields that aren't direct attributes of the model, focusing on how Django deals with fields like `PositionField`. This might occur in the `django/contrib/admin/checks.py` file, specifically within a method related to list display item checks.

Observed method: `django/contrib/admin/checks.py:_check_list_display_item`

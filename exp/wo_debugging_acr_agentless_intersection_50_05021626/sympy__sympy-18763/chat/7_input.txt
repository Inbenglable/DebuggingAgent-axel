<ISSUE>
Incorrect parenthesizing of Subs
Here is an example.
```python
>>> from sympy import Subs
>>> from sympy.abc import x,y
>>> 3*Subs(-x+y, (x,),(1,))
```
LaTeX printing of this gives:  
```python
'3 \\left. - x + y \\right|_{\\substack{ x=1 }}'
```

It would be better to be parenthesized to:  
```python
'3 \\left. \\left(- x + y\\right) \\right|_{\\substack{ x=1 }}'
```

In the previous round, you called search APIs to retrieve relevant source code that would help identify the root cause of the issue and generate a patch. However, the code you retrieved appears in multiple locations (maybe some are irrelevant but have same key). So now your task is to determine which of the retrieved contents are indeed you need, and filter out the irrelevant ones.
This is your API invocation round output:
To resolve the issue, I need to modify the LaTeX printer for the `Subs` expression in SymPy. The method responsible for LaTeX printing is likely located within the `latex.py` file or similar, which handles LaTeX printing of various expressions, including `Subs`.

I will need to search for the method related to the LaTeX printing of `Subs`. Let's proceed to find the relevant source code.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("Subs._latex")
search_method_in_codebase("_print_Subs")
```

And this is the corresponding API returned result (each content is started with #### FILE_PATH:NAME):
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("_print_Subs")
RESULT:
#### sympy/printing/latex.py:LatexPrinter._print_Subs
```python
    def _print_Subs(self, subs):
        expr, old, new = subs.args
        latex_expr = self._print(expr)
        latex_old = (self._print(e) for e in old)
        latex_new = (self._print(e) for e in new)
        latex_subs = r'\\ '.join(
            e[0] + '=' + e[1] for e in zip(latex_old, latex_new))
        return r'\left. %s \right|_{\substack{ %s }}' % (latex_expr,
                                                         latex_subs)

```

#### sympy/printing/str.py:StrPrinter._print_Subs
```python
    def _print_Subs(self, obj):
        expr, old, new = obj.args
        if len(obj.point) == 1:
            old = old[0]
            new = new[0]
        return "Subs(%s, %s, %s)" % (
            self._print(expr), self._print(old), self._print(new))

```

#### sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py:PrettyPrinter._print_Subs
```python
    def _print_Subs(self, e):
        pform = self._print(e.expr)
        pform = prettyForm(*pform.parens())

        h = pform.height() if pform.height() > 1 else 2
        rvert = stringPict(vobj('|', h), baseline=pform.baseline)
        pform = prettyForm(*pform.right(rvert))

        b = pform.baseline
        pform.baseline = pform.height() - 1
        pform = prettyForm(*pform.right(self._print_seq([
            self._print_seq((self._print(v[0]), xsym('=='), self._print(v[1])),
                delimiter='') for v in zip(e.variables, e.point) ])))

        pform.baseline = b
        return pform

```



Among the API returned contents, there may be some irrelevant ones or not. So now you need to analyze each returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.
Now, please first analyze the API returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.

Then you need to choose you needed ones with the following format:
```
FILE_PATH_1:NAME_1
FILE_PATH_2:NAME_2
...
```

Note:
1. The value of FILE_PATH:NAME, must consistent with the API returned content (but remove the prefix ####).
2. You may select one or more contents, or even all of them if they are indeed you need.

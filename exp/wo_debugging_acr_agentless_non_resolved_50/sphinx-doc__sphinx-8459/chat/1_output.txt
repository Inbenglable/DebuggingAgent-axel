To address this issue, I need to examine the relevant parts of the Sphinx codebase responsible for autodoc functionality, specifically focusing on how it handles `autodoc_type_aliases` and `autodoc_typehints`. The likely areas to investigate will be within the autodoc extension files, probably looking for methods related to processing type hints and type aliases.

I will start by searching for the `autodoc_typehints` and `autodoc_type_aliases` within the Sphinx codebase to understand their existing implementations and how they might be interacting improperly when `'description'` is used. 

```python
search_code_in_codebase("autodoc_typehints")
search_code_in_codebase("autodoc_type_aliases")
```

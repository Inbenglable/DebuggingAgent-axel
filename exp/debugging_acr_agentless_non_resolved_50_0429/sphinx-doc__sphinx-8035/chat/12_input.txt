You are a PR reviewer that needs to review the patch generated by a bug repair agent and determine whether the issue is fixed or not.
This is the bug issue, which is in the **sphinx** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Support defining specific `:private-members:` for autodoc
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Currently, if I'm using autodoc, the `:private-members:` option does not allow specification of which private members to document. The current behavior is to document all private members, but what if I would only like to document 1 or 2?

**Describe the solution you'd like**
For `:private-members:` to take arguments, similarly to how `:members:` currently works

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
The current best way to do this is to explicitly list each class in a module and use `:autoattribute:`

   A list of strings that are module names of :doc:`extensions

   By default, Sphinx only supports ``'restructuredtext'`` file type.  You can
   add a new file type using source parser extensions.  Please read a document
   of the extension to know which file type the extension supports.

   The value may also be a list of file extensions: then Sphinx will consider
   that they all map to the ``'restructuredtext'`` file type.

      following ``make html`` needs to be issued in the form ``make text
      O="-E"`` to force re-parsing of source files, as the cached ones are
      already transformed.  On the other hand the issue does not arise with
      direct usage of :program:`sphinx-build` as it caches
      (in its default usage) the parsed source files in per builder locations.

   .. hint:: An alternative way to effectively deactivate (or customize) the
      smart quotes for a given builder, for example ``latex``, is to use
      ``make`` this way:

      .. code-block:: console

         make latex O="-D smartquotes_action="

      This can follow some ``make html`` with no problem, in contrast to the
      situation from the prior note.  It requires Docutils 0.14 or later.

.. confval:: html_sidebars

   Custom sidebar templates, must be a dictionary that maps document names to
   template names.

   The keys can contain glob-style patterns [1]_, in which case all matching
   documents will get the specified sidebars.  (A warning is emitted when a
   more than one glob-style pattern matches for any document.)

   The values can be either lists or single strings.

   * If a value is a list, it specifies the complete list of sidebar templates
     to include.  If all or some of the default sidebars are to be included,
     they must be put into this list as well.

     The default sidebars (for documents that don't match any pattern) are
     defined by theme itself.  Builtin themes are using these templates by
     default: ``['localtoc.html', 'relations.html', 'sourcelink.html',
     'searchbox.html']``.

   * If a value is a single string, it specifies a custom sidebar to be added
     between the ``'sourcelink.html'`` and ``'searchbox.html'`` entries.  This
     is for compatibility with Sphinx versions before 1.0.

   .. deprecated:: 1.7

      a single string value for ``html_sidebars`` will be removed in 2.0

   Builtin sidebar templates that can be rendered are:

   * **localtoc.html** -- a fine-grained table of contents of the current
     document
   * **globaltoc.html** -- a coarse-grained table of contents for the whole
     documentation set, collapsed
   * **relations.html** -- two links to the previous and next documents
   * **sourcelink.html** -- a link to the source of the current document, if
     enabled in :confval:`html_show_sourcelink`
   * **searchbox.html** -- the "quick search" box

   Example::

      html_sidebars = {
         '**': ['globaltoc.html', 'sourcelink.html', 'searchbox.html'],
         'using/windows': ['windowssidebar.html', 'searchbox.html'],
      }

   This will render the custom template ``windowssidebar.html`` and the quick
   search box within the sidebar of the given document, and render the default
   sidebars for all other pages (except that the local TOC is replaced by the
   global TOC).

   .. versionadded:: 1.0
      The ability to use globbing keys and to specify multiple sidebars.

   Note that this value only has no effect if the chosen theme does not possess
   a sidebar, like the builtin **scrolls** and **haiku** themes.[39;49;00m

.. confval:: html_search_options

   A dictionary with options for the search language support, empty by default.
   The meaning of these options depends on the language selected.

   The English support has no options.

   The Japanese support has these options:

   :type:
      _`type` is dotted module path string to specify Splitter implementation
      which should be derived from :class:`sphinx.search.ja.BaseSplitter`.  If
      not specified or None is specified,
      ``'sphinx.search.ja.DefaultSplitter'`` will be used.

      You can choose from these modules:

      :'sphinx.search.ja.DefaultSplitter':
         TinySegmenter algorithm. This is default splitter.
      :'sphinx.search.ja.MecabSplitter':
         MeCab binding. To use this splitter, 'mecab' python binding or dynamic
         link library ('libmecab.so' for linux, 'libmecab.dll' for windows) is
         required.
      :'sphinx.search.ja.JanomeSplitter':
         Janome binding. To use this splitter,
         `Janome <https://pypi.org/project/Janome/>`_ is required.

      .. deprecated:: 1.6
         ``'mecab'``, ``'janome'`` and ``'default'`` is deprecated.
         To keep compatibility, ``'mecab'``, ``'janome'`` and ``'default'`` are
         also acceptable.

   Other option values depend on splitter value which you choose.

   Options for ``'mecab'``:
      :dic_enc:
         _`dic_enc option` is the encoding for the MeCab algorithm.
      :dict:
         _`dict option` is the dictionary to use for the MeCab algorithm.
      :lib:
         _`lib option` is the library name for finding the MeCab library via
         ctypes if the Python binding is not installed.

      For example::

          html_search_options = {
              'type': 'mecab',
              'dic_enc': 'utf-8',
              'dict': '/path/to/mecab.dic',
              'lib': '/path/to/libmecab.so',
          }

   Options for ``'janome'``:
      :user_dic:
         _`user_dic option` is the user dictionary file path for Janome.
      :user_dic_enc:
         _`user_dic_enc option` is the encoding for the user dictionary file
         specified by ``user_dic`` option. Default is 'utf8'.

   * ``'lualatex'`` -- LuaLaTeX

   ``'pdflatex'``\ 's support for Unicode characters is limited.

   .. note::

      2.0 adds to ``'pdflatex'`` support in Latin language document of
      occasional Cyrillic or Greek letters or words.  This is not automatic,
      see the discussion of the :confval:`latex_elements` ``'fontenc'`` key.

   If your project uses Unicode characters, setting the engine to
   ``'xelatex'`` or ``'lualatex'`` and making sure to use an OpenType font
   with wide-enough glyph coverage is often easier than trying to make
   ``'pdflatex'`` work with the extra Unicode characters.  Since Sphinx 2.0
   the default is the GNU FreeFont which covers well Latin, Cyrillic and
   Greek.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.1.0

   Contrarily to :ref:`MathJaX math rendering in HTML output <math-support>`,
   LaTeX requires some extra configuration to support Unicode literals in
   :rst:dir:`math`: the only comprehensive solution (as far as we know) is to
   use ``'xelatex'`` or ``'lualatex'`` *and* to add
   ``r'\usepackage{unicode-math}'`` (e.g. via the :confval:`latex_elements`
   ``'preamble'`` key).  You may prefer
   ``r'\usepackage[math-style=literal]{unicode-math}'`` to keep a Unicode
   literal such as ``α`` (U+03B1) for example as is in output, rather than
   being rendered as :math:`\alpha`.[39;49;00m

.. confval:: latex_documents

   This value determines how to group the document tree into LaTeX source files.
   It must be a list of tuples ``(startdocname, targetname, title, author,
   theme, toctree_only)``, where the items are:

   *startdocname*
     String that specifies the :term:`document name` of the LaTeX file's master
     document.  All documents referenced by the *startdoc* document in TOC trees
     will be included in the LaTeX file.  (If you want to use the default master
     document for your LaTeX build, provide your :confval:`master_doc` here.)

   *targetname*
     File name of the LaTeX file in the output directory.

   *title*
     LaTeX document title.  Can be empty to use the title of the *startdoc*
     document.  This is inserted as LaTeX markup, so special characters like a
     backslash or ampersand must be represented by the proper LaTeX commands if
     they are to be inserted literally.

   *author*
     Author for the LaTeX document.  The same LaTeX markup caveat as for *title*
     applies.  Use ``\\and`` to separate multiple authors, as in:
     ``'John \\and Sarah'`` (backslashes must be Python-escaped to reach LaTeX).

   *theme*
     LaTeX theme.  See :confval:`latex_theme`.

   *toctree_only*
     Must be ``True`` or ``False``.  If true, the *startdoc* document itself is
     not included in the output, only the documents referenced by it via TOC
     trees.  With this option, you can put extra stuff in the master document
     that shows up in the HTML, but not the LaTeX output.

   type ``>{..}``, ``<{..}``, ``@{..}`` as column specification.

   Setting to ``True`` means to use LaTeX's standard ``\multicolumn``; this is
   incompatible with literal blocks in the horizontally merged cell, and also
   with multiple paragraphs in such cell if the table is rendered using
   ``tabulary``.

.. confval:: latex_use_xindy

   If ``True``, the PDF build from the LaTeX files created by Sphinx
   will use :program:`xindy` (doc__) rather than :program:`makeindex`
   for preparing the index of general terms (from :rst:dir:`index`
   usage).  This means that words with UTF-8 characters will get
   ordered correctly for the :confval:`language`.

   __ http://xindy.sourceforge.net/

   - This option is ignored if :confval:`latex_engine` is ``'platex'``
     (Japanese documents; :program:`mendex` replaces :program:`makeindex`
     then).

   - The default is ``True`` for ``'xelatex'`` or ``'lualatex'`` as
     :program:`makeindex`, if any indexed term starts with a non-ascii
     character, creates ``.ind`` files containing invalid bytes for
     UTF-8 encoding. With ``'lualatex'`` this then breaks the PDF
     build.

   - The default is ``False`` for ``'pdflatex'`` but ``True`` is
     recommended for non-English documents as soon as some indexed
     terms use non-ascii characters from the language script.

   Sphinx adds to :program:`xindy` base distribution some dedicated support
   for using ``'pdflatex'`` engine with Cyrillic scripts.  And whether with
   ``'pdflatex'`` or Unicode engines, Cyrillic documents handle correctly the
   indexing of Latin names, even with diacritics.

     special characters.  It is used to determine the file name as well as the
     name of the manual page (in the NAME section).

   *description*
     Description of the manual page.  This is used in the NAME section.

   *authors*
     A list of strings with authors, or a single string.  Can be an empty
     string or list if you do not want to automatically generate an AUTHORS
     section in the manual page.

   *section*

   *title*
     Texinfo document title.  Can be empty to use the title of the *startdoc*
     document.  Inserted as Texinfo markup, so special characters like ``@`` and
     ``{}`` will need to be escaped to be inserted literally.

   *author*
     Author for the Texinfo document.  Inserted as Texinfo markup.  Use ``@*``
     to separate multiple authors, as in: ``'John@*Sarah'``.

   *dir_entry*
     The name that will appear in the top-level ``DIR`` menu file.

   *description*
     Descriptive text to appear in the top-level ``DIR`` menu file.

   *category*
     Specifies the section which this entry will appear in the top-level
     ``DIR`` menu file.

   *toctree_only*
     Must be ``True`` or ``False``.  If true, the *startdoc* document itself is
     not included in the output, only the documents referenced by it via TOC
     trees.  With this option, you can put extra stuff in the master document

## PATCH CONTEXT
<PATCH_CONTEXT>
To address the issue of allowing specific private members to be specified with the `:private-members:` directive in Sphinx's `autodoc` extension, I will make the necessary modifications to the `filter_members` method of the `Documenter` class. The update will involve checking if `:private-members:` contains specific member names and filtering members based on this.

Here are the necessary search/replace edits:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            elif want_all and isprivate:\n=======\n            elif want_all and isprivate and isinstance(self.options.private_members, (list, set)):\n                keep = (membername in self.options.private_members) and (has_doc or self.options.undoc_members)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                keep = self.options.private_members and \\\n=======\n                keep = isinstance(self.options.private_members, bool) and self.options.private_members and \\\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Understanding Check:** We altered the condition to check if specific private member names are passed using `:private-members:`. If `self.options.private_members` is a list or set, we check if the `membername` is present within this list or set, enabling the specification of specific private members.

2. **Backward Compatibility:** We ensured backward compatibility by checking if `self.options.private_members` is a boolean, behaving as originally intended for cases not specifying individual member names.

These edits ensure that the `:private-members:` option can now take specific member names, thus resolving the feature request while maintaining compatibility with existing behavior.

.. confval:: extensions

   A list of strings that are module names of :doc:`extensions

   Note that you can extend :data:`sys.path` within the conf file if your
   extensions live in another directory -- but make sure you use absolute paths.
   If your extension path is relative to the :term:`configuration directory`,
   use :func:`os.path.abspath` like so::

      import sys, os

      sys.path.append(os.path.abspath('sphinxext'))

   That way, you can load an extension called ``extname`` from the subdirectory
   ``sphinxext``.

          '.txt': 'restructuredtext',

   By default, Sphinx only supports ``'restructuredtext'`` file type.  You can
   add a new file type using source parser extensions.  Please read a document
   of the extension to know which file type the extension supports.

   The value may also be a list of file extensions: then Sphinx will consider
   that they all map to the ``'restructuredtext'`` file type.

      following ``make html`` needs to be issued in the form ``make text
      O="-E"`` to force re-parsing of source files, as the cached ones are
      already transformed.  On the other hand the issue does not arise with
      direct usage of :program:`sphinx-build` as it caches
      (in its default usage) the parsed source files in per builder locations.

   .. hint:: An alternative way to effectively deactivate (or customize) the

   * **sourcelink.html** -- a link to the source of the current document, if
     enabled in :confval:`html_show_sourcelink`

         'using/windows': ['windowssidebar.html', 'searchbox.html'],
      }

   This will render the custom template ``windowssidebar.html`` and the quick
   search box within the sidebar of the given document, and render the default
   sidebars for all other pages (except that the local TOC is replaced by the
   global TOC).

.. confval:: html_search_options

   A dictionary with options for the search language support, empty by default.
   The meaning of these options depends on the language selected.

   The English support has no options.

   The Japanese support has these options:

   :type:
      _`type` is dotted module path string to specify Splitter implementation
      which should be derived from :class:`sphinx.search.ja.BaseSplitter`.  If
      not specified or None is specified,
      ``'sphinx.search.ja.DefaultSplitter'`` will be used.

      You can choose from these modules:

      :'sphinx.search.ja.DefaultSplitter':
         TinySegmenter algorithm. This is default splitter.
      :'sphinx.search.ja.MecabSplitter':
         MeCab binding. To use this splitter, 'mecab' python binding or dynamic
         link library ('libmecab.so' for linux, 'libmecab.dll' for windows) is
         required.
      :'sphinx.search.ja.JanomeSplitter':
         Janome binding. To use this splitter,
         `Janome <https://pypi.org/project/Janome/>`_ is required.

      .. deprecated:: 1.6
         ``'mecab'``, ``'janome'`` and ``'default'`` is deprecated.
         To keep compatibility, ``'mecab'``, ``'janome'`` and ``'default'`` are
         also acceptable.

   Other option values depend on splitter value which you choose.

   Options for ``'mecab'``:
      :dic_enc:
         _`dic_enc option` is the encoding for the MeCab algorithm.
      :dict:
         _`dict option` is the dictionary to use for the MeCab algorithm.
      :lib:
         _`lib option` is the library name for finding the MeCab library via
         ctypes if the Python binding is not installed.

      For example::

          html_search_options = {
              'type': 'mecab',
              'dic_enc': 'utf-8',
              'dict': '/path/to/mecab.dic',
              'lib': '/path/to/libmecab.so',
          }

   Options for ``'janome'``:
      :user_dic:
         _`user_dic option` is the user dictionary file path for Janome.
      :user_dic_enc:
         _`user_dic_enc option` is the encoding for the user dictionary file
         specified by ``user_dic`` option. Default is 'utf8'.

      html_search_options for Japanese is re-organized and any custom splitter
      can be used by `type`_ settings.

   * ``'lualatex'`` -- LuaLaTeX

   ``'pdflatex'``\ 's support for Unicode characters is limited.

   .. note::

      2.0 adds to ``'pdflatex'`` support in Latin language document of
      occasional Cyrillic or Greek letters or words.  This is not automatic,
      see the discussion of the :confval:`latex_elements` ``'fontenc'`` key.

   If your project uses Unicode characters, setting the engine to
   ``'xelatex'`` or ``'lualatex'`` and making sure to use an OpenType font
   with wide-enough glyph coverage is often easier than trying to make
   ``'pdflatex'`` work with the extra Unicode characters.  Since Sphinx 2.0
   the default is the GNU FreeFont which covers well Latin, Cyrillic and
   Greek.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.1.0

   Contrarily to :ref:`MathJaX math rendering in HTML output <math-support>`,
   LaTeX requires some extra configuration to support Unicode literals in
   :rst:dir:`math`: the only comprehensive solution (as far as we know) is to
   use ``'xelatex'`` or ``'lualatex'`` *and* to add
   ``r'\usepackage{unicode-math}'`` (e.g. via the :confval:`latex_elements`
   ``'preamble'`` key).  You may prefer
   ``r'\usepackage[math-style=literal]{unicode-math}'`` to keep a Unicode
   literal such as ``α`` (U+03B1) for example as is in output, rather than

.. confval:: latex_documents

   This value determines how to group the document tree into LaTeX source files.
   It must be a list of tuples ``(startdocname, targetname, title, author,
   theme, toctree_only)``, where the items are:

   *startdocname*
     String that specifies the :term:`document name` of the LaTeX file's master
     document.  All documents referenced by the *startdoc* document in TOC trees
     will be included in the LaTeX file.  (If you want to use the default master
     document for your LaTeX build, provide your :confval:`master_doc` here.)

   *targetname*
     File name of the LaTeX file in the output directory.

   *title*
     LaTeX document title.  Can be empty to use the title of the *startdoc*
     document.  This is inserted as LaTeX markup, so special characters like a
     backslash or ampersand must be represented by the proper LaTeX commands if
     they are to be inserted literally.

   *author*
     Author for the LaTeX document.  The same LaTeX markup caveat as for *title*
     applies.  Use ``\\and`` to separate multiple authors, as in:
     ``'John \\and Sarah'`` (backslashes must be Python-escaped to reach LaTeX).

   *theme*
     LaTeX theme.  See :confval:`latex_theme`.

   *toctree_only*
     Must be ``True`` or ``False``.  If true, the *startdoc* document itself is
     not included in the output, only the documents referenced by it via TOC
     trees.  With this option, you can put extra stuff in the master document
     that shows up in the HTML, but not the LaTeX output.

.. confval:: latex_use_xindy

   If ``True``, the PDF build from the LaTeX files created by Sphinx
   will use :program:`xindy` (doc__) rather than :program:`makeindex`
   for preparing the index of general terms (from :rst:dir:`index`
   usage).  This means that words with UTF-8 characters will get
   ordered correctly for the :confval:`language`.

   __ http://xindy.sourceforge.net/

   - This option is ignored if :confval:`latex_engine` is ``'platex'``
     (Japanese documents; :program:`mendex` replaces :program:`makeindex`
     then).

   - The default is ``True`` for ``'xelatex'`` or ``'lualatex'`` as
     :program:`makeindex`, if any indexed term starts with a non-ascii
     character, creates ``.ind`` files containing invalid bytes for
     UTF-8 encoding. With ``'lualatex'`` this then breaks the PDF
     build.

   - The default is ``False`` for ``'pdflatex'`` but ``True`` is
     recommended for non-English documents as soon as some indexed
     terms use non-ascii characters from the language script.

   Sphinx adds to :program:`xindy` base distribution some dedicated support
   for using ``'pdflatex'`` engine with Cyrillic scripts.  And whether with
   ``'pdflatex'`` or Unicode engines, Cyrillic documents handle correctly the
   indexing of Latin names, even with diacritics.

     String that specifies the :term:`document name` of the manual page's master

     will be included in the manual file.  (If you want to use the default
     master document for your manual pages build, use your :confval:`master_doc`
     here.)

   *name*
     Name of the manual page.  This should be a short string without spaces or
     special characters.  It is used to determine the file name as well as the
     name of the manual page (in the NAME section).

   *description*
     Description of the manual page.  This is used in the NAME section.

   *authors*
     A list of strings with authors, or a single string.  Can be an empty
     string or list if you do not want to automatically generate an AUTHORS
     section in the manual page.

   *section*
     The manual page section.  Used for the output file name as well as in the
     manual page header.

   *startdocname*
     String that specifies the :term:`document name` of the the Texinfo file's
     master document.  All documents referenced by the *startdoc* document in
     TOC trees will be included in the Texinfo file.  (If you want to use the
     default master document for your Texinfo build, provide your
     :confval:`master_doc` here.)

   *targetname*
     File name (no extension) of the Texinfo file in the output directory.

   *title*
     Texinfo document title.  Can be empty to use the title of the *startdoc*
     document.  Inserted as Texinfo markup, so special characters like ``@`` and
     ``{}`` will need to be escaped to be inserted literally.

   *author*
     Author for the Texinfo document.  Inserted as Texinfo markup.  Use ``@*``
     to separate multiple authors, as in: ``'John@*Sarah'``.

   *dir_entry*
     The name that will appear in the top-level ``DIR`` menu file.

   *description*
     Descriptive text to appear in the top-level ``DIR`` menu file.

   *category*
     Specifies the section which this entry will appear in the top-level
     ``DIR`` menu file.

   *toctree_only*
     Must be ``True`` or ``False``.  If true, the *startdoc* document itself is
     not included in the output, only the documents referenced by it via TOC
     trees.  With this option, you can put extra stuff in the master document
     that shows up in the HTML, but not the Texinfo output.

   Functions imported from C modules cannot be introspected, and therefore the

   If this boolean value is set to ``True`` (which is the default), autodoc will
   look at the first line of the docstring for functions and methods, and if it

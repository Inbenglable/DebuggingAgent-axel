To properly address the issue, I need to inspect the `URLResolver` class and its `_populate` method, since the optimization involves minimizing the calls to `_populate`. This will help me understand how `_populate` works and why it's expensive to call it multiple times.

I'll proceed to search for the `URLResolver` class and the `_populate` method within that class in the `django/urls/resolvers.py` file.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/urls/resolvers.py", "URLResolver")
search_method_in_file("django/urls/resolvers.py", "URLResolver._populate")
```

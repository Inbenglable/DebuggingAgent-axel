Let's review the issue behavior to locate the bug. The error trace highlights the problem occurring in the `wrapper` function within the file `astropy/units/decorators.py`.

The error emerges when the `units.quantity_input` decorator tries to handle a function with a return type of `None`. The decorator attempts to validate or convert the returned value using `.to()`, but since the returned value is `None`, this leads to an `AttributeError`.

Given the error and its context, we can directly focus on the `wrapper` method within the file `astropy/units/decorators.py`.

Buggy method: `astropy/units/decorators.py:wrapper`

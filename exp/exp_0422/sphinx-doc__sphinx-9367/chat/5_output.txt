The `unparse` function in `sphinx/pycode/ast.py` is responsible for converting an abstract syntax tree (AST) back into a string representation. The key aspect here is that a single-element tuple, such as `(1,)`, should retain the trailing comma to correctly represent it as a tuple and not just an integer within parentheses.

From the `unparse` function, the next logical step is to examine how the conversion happens when the AST is visited by the `_UnparseVisitor`. This visitor determines how different nodes in the AST should be converted back to strings. The `_UnparseVisitor` logic potentially contains the specific behavior that omits the comma for single-element tuples.

Thus, the next step is to look into the implementation of the `_UnparseVisitor` class or functions utilized within it, particularly focusing on parts relating to node visiting and string conversion for tuples.

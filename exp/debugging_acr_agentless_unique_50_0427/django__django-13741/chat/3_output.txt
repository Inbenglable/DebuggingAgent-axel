To resolve the issue and identify where the fix should be applied, the first step involves analyzing the problem with setting up the Django environment in the test. The error observed is related to the lack of a proper Django settings module, which is critical for the initialization of Django components.

Upon executing `django.setup()`, the method `_setup` in `LazySettings` tries to load the settings module by accessing the environment variable `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`. If this variable is not set or the specified settings module cannot be found, it raises an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception.

This is why the error indicates the missing `'test_settings'` module, preventing any further testing of the new feature request.

### Steps for Resolution:
1. **Create a Proper Django Settings Module**: Ensure you have an appropriate test settings module (`test_settings.py`) that Django can find and use.
2. **Verify Environment Variable**: Make sure that the environment variable `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is correctly set to point to this settings module.

However, to address the original issue described (around `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField`), after the testing environment is resolved, the necessary implementation would be in the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` itself.

### Next Steps:
To identify where in `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` the changes are needed, moving forward into the Django forms’ implementation is advisable. We need to trace back to where `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` is instantiated and how the `disabled` attribute is currently managed.

Since the buggy code in the first step isn't identified yet (we are dealing with a setup issue), I’ll proceed to deeper observe the actual method handling `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField`.

So, let's switch focus back to `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` as intended for modification, though the current issue has primarily blocked testing.

### Action:
Assuming test settings are fixed, let's trace the area responsible for `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField`, usually placed in Django's forms:

Observed scope: `django/contrib/auth/forms.py` (This is the typical file for Django authentication forms, though specific lines will require direct search and confirmation based on your Django version in use). Would you like me to focus directly on the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` definition if detailed traces indicate it?

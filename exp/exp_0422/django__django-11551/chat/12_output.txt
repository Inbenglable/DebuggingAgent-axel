To address the identified issue within the `_check_list_display_item` method, we need to adjust how field retrieval attempts and validations are conducted, enhancing it to handle descriptor-based fields like `PositionField` appropriately. We'll introduce a revised method of field verification.

Here's the patch to be applied to the method:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/admin/checks.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        elif hasattr(obj.model, item):\n=======\n        try:\n            field = obj.model._meta.get_field(item)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/contrib/admin/checks.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            try:\n                field = obj.model._meta.get_field(item)\n            except FieldDoesNotExist:\n                return []\n=======\n        except FieldDoesNotExist:\n            try:\n                field = getattr(obj.model, item)\n            except AttributeError:\n                return [\n                    checks.Error(\n                        \"The value of '%s' refers to '%s', which is not a callable, \"\n                        \"an attribute of '%s', or an attribute or method on '%s.%s'.\" % (\n                            label, item, obj.__class__.__name__,\n                            obj.model._meta.app_label, obj.model._meta.object_name,\n                        ),\n                        obj=obj.__class__,\n                        id='admin.E108',\n                    )\n                ]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Field Retrieval Fix**: We no longer rely solely on `hasattr(obj.model, item)`. Instead, attempt `get_field(item)` directly, and back it up with `getattr(obj.model, item)` if the first attempt fails.
2. **Error Handling**: Adjusted exception handling so that if `get_field` fails, field retrieval through `getattr` is attempted. It's only when both these approaches fail that an `admin.E108` error is raised.
3. **Many-to-Many Check**: The check to ensure that the field is not a `ManyToManyField` is preserved after successful retrieval.

This patch aligns the field-check behavior with broader descriptor support, preventing erroneous errors like `admin.E108` for valid descriptors like `PositionField`.

You are a PR reviewer that needs to review the patch generated by a bug repair agent and determine whether the issue is fixed or not.
This is the bug issue, which is in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Abstract model field should not be equal across models
Description
	
Consider the following models:
class A(models.Model):
	class Meta:
		abstract = True
	myfield = IntegerField()
class B(A):
	pass
class C(A):
	pass
If I pull the fields of B and C into a shared set, one will be de-duplicated away, because they compare as equal. I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.
len({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1
B._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')
We should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.
When adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.
I brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
## REPRODUCE TEST
```
import os

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)

    settings.configure(

        DATABASES={
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',

    pass

class C(A):
    pass

def main():
    field_b = B._meta.get_field('myfield')
    field_c = C._meta.get_field('myfield')
    
    try:
        # Check if the fields are considered equal
        assert field_b != field_c, "Fields should not be equal"
        # Check if the length of the set is 2 (indicating no de-duplication)
        assert len({field_b, field_c}) == 2, "Set should contain two unique fields"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        print("Issue is fixed.")
        sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

And this is the original output when running the test (before applying the patch):
## ORIGINAL OUTPUT

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-13401/reproduce.py", line 42, in <module>

```

The repair agent has tried to generate a patch to fix the issue:
## PATCH CONTEXT
<PATCH_CONTEXT>
Here is the patch to resolve the issue by modifying the `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods in the `Field` class:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        # Needed for @total_ordering\n        if isinstance(other, Field):\n            return self.creation_counter == other.creation_counter\n        return NotImplemented\n=======\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        # Needed for @total_ordering\n        if isinstance(other, Field):\n            return (self.creation_counter == other.creation_counter and\n                    self.model == other.model)\n        return NotImplemented\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    def __hash__(self):\n        return hash(self.creation_counter)\n=======\n    def __hash__(self):\n        return hash((self.creation_counter, self.model))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    def __lt__(self, other):\n        # This is needed because bisect does not take a comparison function.\n        if isinstance(other, Field):\n            return self.creation_counter < other.creation_counter\n        return NotImplemented\n=======\n    def __lt__(self, other):\n        # This is needed because bisect does not take a comparison function.\n        if isinstance(other, Field):\n            return (self.creation_counter < other.creation_counter or\n                    (self.creation_counter == other.creation_counter and\n                     self.model < other.model))\n        return NotImplemented\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch ensures that fields from different models are treated as distinct, preventing de-duplication in sets and affecting comparisons considering the model attribute.
</PATCH_CONTEXT>

After applying the patch, the output of the test is:
## PATCHED OUTPUT
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-13401/reproduce.py", line 42, in <module>

    "INSTALLED_APPS." % (module, name)
RuntimeError: Model class __main__.B doesn't declare an explicit app_label and isn't in an application in INSTALLED_APPS.

```

Now, please first review the patch and analyse the test output before and after the patch, to determine whether the issue is fixed or not.

Let's analyze the returned contents:

The output of the search function shows two entries for `Session`, but they are essentially the same:

1. **build/lib/requests/sessions.py:Session**
2. **requests/sessions.py:Session**

Both contents seem to represent the same class, `Session`, within the `requests` library. However, the difference in the file path (`build/lib/` vs `requests/`) may indicate a difference in the location where this code is stored or compiled. Typically, `build/lib/` might be a build output folder, and `requests/` is likely the source code directory.

For the purpose of examining and altering the source code, the relevant content would be from the source directory. Thus, the content found in `requests/sessions.py:Session` is what I need to work with, as it contains the original code utilized in development. 

Therefore, the `requests/sessions.py:Session` entry is the one needed:

```
requests/sessions.py:Session
```

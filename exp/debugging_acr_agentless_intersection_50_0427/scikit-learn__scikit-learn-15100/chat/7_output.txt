The patch context indicates that there was an attempt to modify the code in `sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py` to handle the normalization issue. The patch suggests removing the condition `if normalized == s: return s`, which might be causing `strip_accents_unicode` to return the string unchanged if it's already in NFKD form.

However, the patched output shows that a `SyntaxError` occurred due to an incorrect syntax. This suggests that the modification was not correctly integrated into the existing code structure, leading to a syntax issue.

Original test output:
- The issue was clearly present, as the test highlighted that `s2` was unchanged by `strip_accents_unicode`.

Patched test output:
- The test did not execute correctly due to a syntax error, specifically after applying the patch. This indicates there was a mistake in the patch application.

Based on the provided information, the issue is not resolved due to the syntactical error in the patch. Therefore, the primary bug was not addressed, and the test could not run to verify the issue resolution.

Issue resolved: `False`

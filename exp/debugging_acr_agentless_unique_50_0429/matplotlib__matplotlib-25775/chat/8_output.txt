Based on the analysis of the provided code and the runtime information, the problem arises because the `Text` object in Matplotlib does not currently support the `set_antialiased` method, leading to the `AttributeError` observed. 

The `Text` class lacks the infrastructure to manage antialiasing on a per-instance basis due to missing designated methods `set_antialiased` and `get_antialiased`. These methods need to manipulate an internal antialiasing attribute, and adjustments are needed in rendering logic to use this attribute over global `rcParams`.

Given the indications from the runtime information and the previous observations, the `RendererAgg.draw_text` method mentioned in the runtime information would be an appropriate location to trace next. It is likely where text rendering logic is implemented, and where global `rcParams` might be accessed for antialiasing configurations.

Observed method: `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_agg.py:RendererAgg.draw_text`

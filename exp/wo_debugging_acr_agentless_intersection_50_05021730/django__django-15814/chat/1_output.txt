To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code for the existing logic where the problem occurs. The line mentioned in the issue is at `django/db/models/sql/query.py` around line 745. Specifically, I need to see how the `opts` is assigned and if there's any surrounding logic impacting it. Therefore, I'll search for the relevant code surrounding line 745 in the file `django/db/models/sql/query.py`.

```python
search_code_in_file("django/db/models/sql/query.py", "opts = cur_model._meta")
```

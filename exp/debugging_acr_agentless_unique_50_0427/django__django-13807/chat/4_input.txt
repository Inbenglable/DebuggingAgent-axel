Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
loaddata crashes on SQLite when table names are SQL keywords.
Description
	
Steps to reproduce:
Create a Model called Order. (order is a SQL reserved word)
Create fixtures for the model
Use manage.py loaddata to load the fixture.
Notice that it fails with the following error. This is because the table name order is not quoted properly
(0.000) PRAGMA foreign_key_check(order); args=None
Traceback (most recent call last):

This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
The test script is attempting to reproduce the issue with Django's `loaddata` command when using a model named `Order`, which corresponds to a table name that is a reserved SQL keyword. The provided script is failing with the error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'test_app'` during the `django.setup()` process when trying to populate the installed apps.

### Analysis

1. **Reproduction Code Structure**:
   - A Django settings configuration is being defined inline within the script, including `INSTALLED_APPS` with a fictional app `'test_app'`.
   - An `Order` model is defined directly in the script.
   - A fixture is created for this `Order` model and then loaded, which is where the original error is expected to reproduce.

2. **Current Failure**:
   - The script fails at `django.setup()` because Django is trying to load `'test_app'`, which is specified as part of `INSTALLED_APPS`, but a corresponding actual Django app/package does not exist, resulting in `ModuleNotFoundError`.
   
### Conclusion

The test script isn't correctly structured as a Django project with an actual Django app `'test_app'` set up in the environment where this script is being executed. This leads to an import error when Django tries to load applications listed in `INSTALLED_APPS`.

To proceed, the observed failure is not in the code being tested but in the test infrastructure setup. The test needs to be adjusted by either creating and registering a mock or temporary app properly in the test environment or modifying the approach to dynamically define apps within the same module where `INSTALLED_APPS` can access them correctly without relying on the import mechanism.

However, this error does not help us locate the problem with the `check_constraints` function in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py`, which is the ultimate goal.

### Next Step

We should examine the `check_constraints` method in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py` to confirm its behavior and the potential use of backticks. The goal is to verify and correct the SQL execution to properly handle reserved table names.

**Observed method: `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py:check_constraints`**
==================================================
### Analysis of Current Observed Code

The `check_constraints` method is designed to validate foreign key constraints on the specified tables within a SQLite database. The current implementation in lines 316-385 contains SQL statements in the following parts:

1. **Lines 326-332:**
   - `PRAGMA foreign_key_check(%s)` - This line attempts to execute the SQLite pragma to check for foreign key violations on specific tables. When the table name is a reserved keyword, it is not quoted correctly, leading to syntax errors.

2. **Lines 335-337:**
   - `PRAGMA foreign_key_list(%s)` - Similarly, this executes the SQLite pragma to retrieve a list of foreign keys in a table. Using reserved SQL keywords without quotes can also lead to issues here.

3. **Lines 340-345:**
   - SQL select statement: `SELECT %s, %s FROM %s WHERE rowid = %%s` - The table name (`%s`) here also requires quotes if it's a reserved keyword.

4. **SQLite Features:**
   - The block in lines 354-385 handles cases where `self.features.supports_pragma_foreign_key_check` is false, but doesn't seem directly affected by the issue as it's based on straight SQL joins rather than pragma commands.

### Abnormal Behavior

The observed abnormal behavior is a syntax error when executing the `PRAGMA foreign_key_check(order)` statement because the table name `order` isn't quoted. SQLite requires quoting reserved words, which are treated here as table names, using backticks for proper execution:

- **Expected Correction**: Replace `PRAGMA foreign_key_check(%s)` with `PRAGMA foreign_key_check(`%s`)` or use a safe quoting mechanism.

### Path Forward

To identify the root cause and locate the buggy method and code, we need to trace the behavior of specific lines that are contributing to the SQL syntax errors by observing how the table names are handled and passed to the SQL statements.

**Observed scope**: `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py:326-331`

We need to check downstream how the table names are formatted in SQL queries, particularly focusing on:
- How the table names (`table_name`) are being interpolated into SQL statements.
- Ensuring quotes are added around table names that are reserved SQL keywords. 

Once the erroneous behavior in these lines is confirmed, it will be necessary to apply the correct quoting to the affected SQL statement parts.
==================================================
### Analysis of Current Observed Code

The currently observed code is part of the `DatabaseWrapper.check_constraints` method in the `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py` file. The relevant lines (326-331) manage foreign key constraint checks by executing SQL pragma statements. These lines attempt to check foreign key constraints using:

- **Line 327:** `PRAGMA foreign_key_check` for all table names when `table_names` is `None`.
- **Lines 329-331:** `PRAGMA foreign_key_check(%s)` for each table provided in `table_names`.

The problem arises particularly with the latter (`PRAGMA foreign_key_check(%s)`) where `table_name` is being directly included in the SQL statement without being properly quoted. This leads to syntax errors when `table_name` is a reserved SQL keyword, like `order`.

### Abnormal Behavior

The runtime error indicates an `AssertionError` in a separate test script, which is related to a test setup issue (`conda run` failure). The error suggests a missing file path, unrelated to this direct code, indicating that the problem lies in the test infrastructure rather than this specific code logic.

Nonetheless, the abnormal behavior within the Django code context is the use of reserved words (like `order`) as table names not being quoted, which should be corrected to prevent syntax errors in SQL statements.

### Conclusion

The code snippet provided underscores the unpreparedness for handling table names that are SQL keywords, requiring proper quoting.

### Next Steps

To pinpoint the root cause and locate the specific buggy code or method, analyzing how table names are passed and manipulated for SQL execution is crucial.

Given the issue pertains to quoting in SQL queries, particularly affecting SQLite, the focus should remain on methods that manipulate or execute these specific queries.

### Decision

The current analysis suggests focusing on the observed lines to ensure appropriate handling of reserved SQL keywords within the SQL queries.

The patch aimed to address the issue by synchronizing the random seed between single-threaded and multi-threaded executions in the `KMeans` function. However, according to the output of the test after applying the patch, the issue of inconsistent inertia values persists. 

- **Original Output:** The inertia values for `n_jobs=1` and `n_jobs=2` were 17815.004991244623 and 17815.060435554242, respectively.
- **Patched Output:** The inertia values for `n_jobs=1` and `n_jobs=2` became 17815.004991244623 and 17815.504408961846, respectively.

The inertia for `n_jobs=1` remains the same, but the inertia for `n_jobs=2` has changed to a significantly different value, which indicates that the patch did not resolve the inconsistency issue.

Issue resolved: `False`

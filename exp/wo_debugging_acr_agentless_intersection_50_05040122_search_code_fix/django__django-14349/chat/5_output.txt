Upon reviewing the provided patch and test outputs, it is clear that the issue has not been resolved. 

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Patch Intent**: The patch is intended to modify the `__call__` method in `django/core/validators.py` to strip LF, CR, and tab characters from the input URL string before processing. This change aims to ensure the URLValidator's behavior aligns with Python's updated URL splitting logic.

2. **Patched Code Error**: The error seen in the patched output (`IndentationError: unexpected indent`) indicates that there was an indentation mistake during the patch application. Such an error prevents the code from executing, implying that the patch, as it stands, fails to function as intended.

3. **Original vs. Patched Test Outputs**:
   - **Original Output**: The tests failed because the `ValidationError` was expected but not raised due to the presence of LF characters in URLs.
   - **Patched Output**: The tests do not even run successfully due to the `IndentationError`, making it impossible to determine if the issue would have been resolved had the patch been correctly applied.

Therefore, since the patch introduced an indentation error leading to broken code execution, the issue is not resolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

To resolve the issue related to `SimpleLazyObject` in `kwargs` within `get_context_data`, the patch will involve converting any `SimpleLazyObject` found within `kwargs` into a string. Here's the patch applied using the search/replace format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/views/generic/base.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        return kwargs\n=======\n        resolved_kwargs = {key: str(value) if isinstance(value, SimpleLazyObject) else value for key, value in kwargs.items()}\n        return resolved_kwargs\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch modifies the return line in the `get_context_data` method to include a check that converts `SimpleLazyObject` instances to strings, updating the handling to prevent error during filtering operations, while preserving any other types unchanged.

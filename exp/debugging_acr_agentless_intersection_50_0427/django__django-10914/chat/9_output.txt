To resolve the issue of inconsistent file upload permissions in Django's `FileSystemStorage`, you can modify the `_save` method to explicitly set the file permissions, ensuring they conform to the desired default `0o644` if the `file_permissions_mode` is not already set.

Here is a `SEARCH/REPLACE` patch to apply the changes:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/core/files/storage.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            os.chmod(full_path, self.file_permissions_mode)\n=======\n            os.chmod(full_path, self.file_permissions_mode)\n        else:\n            os.chmod(full_path, 0o644)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch will:

1. Check if `file_permissions_mode` is set, and apply it using `os.chmod`.
2. If `file_permissions_mode` is not set, it will default to `0o644`, ensuring consistent file permissions for all uploaded files, regardless of whether they were uploaded as a `TemporaryUploadedFile` or otherwise.

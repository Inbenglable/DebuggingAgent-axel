To generate the patch, I need to gather the source code of the `FileInput` class as I might need to move the `use_required_attribute()` method into it, and potentially modify or override this function. Given the previous API calls have returned only the class definition without its methods, I will now retrieve the detailed implementation of the `FileInput` class.

Additionally, I will also check the existence of the `use_required_attribute()` method in the parent class `Input`, which `FileInput` inherits from, to understand its current behavior.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "Input")
```

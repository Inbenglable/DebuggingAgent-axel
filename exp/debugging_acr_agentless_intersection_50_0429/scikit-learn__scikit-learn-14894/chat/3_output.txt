To resolve the issue, I need to examine the source code of the `_sparse_fit` method in the `BaseLibSVM` class, which is located in `sklearn/svm/base.py` as identified in the debugging history. This will allow me to consider appropriate checks and handling to prevent the division by zero error when there are no support vectors.

I'll retrieve the source code of the `_sparse_fit` method to proceed with generating the patch.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/svm/base.py", "BaseLibSVM._sparse_fit")
```

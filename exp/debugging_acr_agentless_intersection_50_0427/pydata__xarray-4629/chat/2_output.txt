Analyzing the provided information and execution trace, we observed that the issue arises in the handling of attributes within the `merge_core` function of the xarray library. The abnormal behavior wherein an attribute of the merged dataset (`xds3`) affects the original dataset (`xds1`) is unintended. This occurs due to a direct reference rather than copying of the attributes when `combine_attrs='override'` is specified.

Looking at the source code of the `merge_core` function, we see the attributes are merged using `merge_attrs`. The understanding is that `merge_attrs` should copy attributes rather than reference them.

The current trace is focused on the `merge_attrs` function call on line 616. To determine if the problem arises during the merging of attributes, further investigation into the `merge_attrs` methodâ€™s implementation is necessary to locate where dictionary references are incorrectly handled.

Observed scope: `xarray/core/merge.py:616-623`

This will help to trace the function handling the 'override' case for `combine_attrs` and pinpoint where the deep copy of attributes should be applied.

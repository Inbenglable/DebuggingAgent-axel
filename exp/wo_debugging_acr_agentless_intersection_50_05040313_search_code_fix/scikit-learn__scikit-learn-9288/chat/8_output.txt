The patch generates a warning indicating a problem with the definition or usage of the variable `seeds`. Specifically, the NameError in the output after applying the patch suggests that the `seeds` array was not defined or properly passed to the k-means single run method, likely because its scope was not correctly managed or it was not initialized at the right location. This indicates that the patch is incomplete or incorrectly applied, leading to a failure when trying to use the `seeds` array for random state initialization.

From reviewing the test output and patch details:

1. **Original Issue:** Different results for `n_jobs=1` vs. `n_jobs>1` due to inconsistent random seeding.
2. **Patch Goal:** Ensure consistent random seeding by introducing a `seeds` array for both single-threaded and multi-threaded operations.
3. **Test Output After Patch:** The patch introduces a new error (`NameError: name 'seeds' is not defined`), indicating the changes have not been correctly implemented or tested.

The error indicates that the fix was not applied correctly or completely, so the original issue is not resolved. This persistence of the problem is especially evident as a new error was introduced.

Issue resolved: `False`

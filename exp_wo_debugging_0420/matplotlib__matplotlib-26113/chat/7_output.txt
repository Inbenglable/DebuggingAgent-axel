I have examined the relevant code for the `hexbin` method, particularly focusing on the parts where the `mincnt` parameter is checked in both cases: when `C` is `None` and when `C` is not `None`. The inconsistency issue arises due to the differing conditions for these two cases (`len(acc) >= mincnt` and `len(acc) > mincnt`).

I am ready to make a patch to address the issue by standardizing the behavior to use `len(acc) >= mincnt` in both cases, ensuring consistent handling regardless of whether `C` is provided.

Ready generation: `True`

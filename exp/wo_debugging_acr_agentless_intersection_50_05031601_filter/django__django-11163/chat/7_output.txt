To resolve the issue where `model_to_dict()` should return an empty dictionary for an empty list of fields, we need to modify the conditional statement that checks for fields. Here is the appropriate patch:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/forms/models.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if fields and f.name not in fields:\n=======\n        if fields is not None and f.name not in fields:\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

To generate a patch, I need to analyze the migration optimizer's code, especially the part responsible for reducing operations such as `AlterField`. I will search for the optimizer code in the Django project to understand how it processes and optimizes migrations. Once the relevant code is identified, I'll be ready to create the patch.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("optimize")
search_class_in_codebase("MigrationOptimizer")
search_method_in_codebase("AlterField.reduce")
search_class_in_codebase("AlterField")
search_code_in_codebase("self.is_same_field_operation")
```

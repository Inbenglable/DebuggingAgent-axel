Now You need to reolve the following issue in the **sympy** project:
#### ISSUE
UnboundLocalError in evalf
```
>>> Mul(x, Max(0, y), evaluate=False).evalf()
x*Max(0, y)
>>> Mul(Max(0, y), x, evaluate=False).evalf()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./sympy/core/evalf.py", line 1285, in evalf
    rf = evalf_table[x.func]
KeyError: Max

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "./sympy/core/evalf.py", line 1394, in evalf
    result = evalf(self, prec + 4, options)
  File "./sympy/core/evalf.py", line 1286, in evalf
    r = rf(x, prec, options)
  File "./sympy/core/evalf.py", line 538, in evalf_mul
    arg = evalf(arg, prec, options)
  File "./sympy/core/evalf.py", line 1308, in evalf
    r = re, im, reprec, imprec
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'reprec' referenced before assignment
```

I found this after changing the order of Mul args in https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/13059.

Based on the code, I think the elif clauses that define reprec and imprec should have an `else: raise NotImplementedError`. That appears to fix it, although I didn't try to debug to see why the arg order is mattering here. 

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
Analyzing the error traceback indicates that there is an issue within the `evalf` method in `sympy/core/evalf.py`. Specifically, the error arises because `reprec` and `imprec` are referenced before being assigned any value, which happens because the flow of the program does not cover all possible cases leading to those variables being properly initialized. The issue arises during the evaluation of `Mul(Max(0, y), x, evaluate=False).evalf()`.

The observed debug output suggests that the problem begins when trying to retrieve a specific evaluation function for the `Max` object from the `evalf_table`, leading to a subsequent error related to unassigned variables.

Given this, it's likely that the issue lies within the `evalf` method. This method attempts to lookup a function for `Max` in `evalf_table`. When the lookup fails, it handles `Max` objects but fails to define `reprec` and `imprec` under certain conditions, resulting in the `UnboundLocalError`.

Therefore the `evalf` method in `sympy/core/evalf.py` needs to be examined further to understand why these variables remain uninitialized, especially when handling `Max` during multiplication.

Buggy method: `sympy/core/evalf.py:evalf`
==================================================


Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

### IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

### IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

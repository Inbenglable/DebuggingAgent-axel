Based on the issue description, we're dealing with a problem related to the `format` function in the `django.utils.numberformat` module, which improperly renders small decimals in exponential notation. Here's the analysis of the API returned contents:

1. **django/utils/dateformat.py:format**:
   - This function is related to formatting dates, not numbers. Therefore, it is irrelevant to the issue at hand.

2. **django/utils/numberformat.py:format**:
   - This is the function of interest. It specifically deals with number formatting, including handling decimals and scientific notation, which is directly related to the issue description.

Hence, the relevant content for analyzing and addressing the issue is:

```
django/utils/numberformat.py:format
```

To resolve the issue, I need to find the implementations of the methods responsible for printing `dict` and `set` types in the `ReprPrinter` class. Given the convention in the code provided, methods seem to follow a naming pattern like `_print_dict` and `_print_set`. Therefore, I'll search for these methods within the `sympy/printing/repr.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/repr.py", "ReprPrinter._print_dict")
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/repr.py", "ReprPrinter._print_set")
```

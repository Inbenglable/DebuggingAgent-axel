The error message "Apps aren't loaded yet" from the `Apps.check_apps_ready` method indicates that the Django application registry is not properly initialized when the `MigrationLoader` attempts to load migrations. This happens because the Django framework requires full setup through its initialization process before interacting with app configurations.

The current abnormal behavior shows that this exception is raised because the script does not call `django.setup()`, which is essential to populate the app registry before executing methods relying on Django's app configurations.

Thus, it is crucial to focus on resolving this setup issue before dealing with the actual logic that requires modification for handling packages without the `__file__`.

Given this analysis and the current tracing history, the root cause of the bug lies in the testing script and setup environment, rather than within a single buggy method inside Django's source itself.

Hence we should adjust the script, ensuring that Django is properly initialized. However, since the improvement should apply to `MigrationLoader.load_disk`, this method is likely the area that requires adjustment to incorporate the proposed feature request.

I will enhance the test setup to initialize Django properly and then observe how the `MigrationLoader.load_disk` method can be adjusted to resolve the issue when dealing with packages without a `__file__`.

Buggy method: `django/db/migrations/loader.py:MigrationLoader.load_disk`

To address the issue of adding `get/set_antialiased` methods to the `Text` class, I will need to:

1. Inspect the methods in the `Text` class in `lib/matplotlib/text.py` to add the new antialiasing methods.
2. Look at how `rcParams["text.antialias"]` is being used in the context of text rendering.
3. See the implementation of `set_antialiased` in the `GraphicsContextBase` class in `lib/matplotlib/backend_bases.py` to understand how to apply antialiasing settings properly.

I will proceed by fetching the `draw` method in the `Text` class as that is likely where antialiasing would be applied during rendering.

```python
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/text.py", "Text.draw")
search_code_in_file("lib/matplotlib/text.py", "rcParams[\"text.antialias\"]")
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/backend_bases.py", "GraphicsContextBase.set_antialiased")
```

To address the issue, we need to precisely understand how the `_print_Add` method within `StrPrinter` in the `sympy/printing/str.py` file currently functions. Therefore, I will retrieve the source code for this method to ensure that we can effectively adjust the logic to handle subtraction expressions correctly when printing.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/str.py", "StrPrinter._print_Add")
```

To resolve the issue with the `urlize` function in the Django project, we need to determine which of the retrieved `urlize` function definitions is relevant to the problem described. Here's the analysis of the two results returned:

1. **django/template/defaultfilters.py:urlize**:
   - This is a wrapper function that calls the `_urlize` function with some fixed parameters. It does not contain the main logic of the `urlize` function that processes the input string.

2. **django/utils/html.py:urlize**:
   - This contains the main logic for converting URLs in text into clickable links. It includes handling of punctuation, HTML escaping, and various conditions for matching URLs and emails.

Given the description of the issue, the root cause likely lies in how the `urlize` logic is dealing with HTML-escaped strings and trailing punctuation. The detailed implementation, which needs examination and possibly modification, is located in `django/utils/html.py:urlize`.

Therefore, the relevant content needed to address this issue is:

```
django/utils/html.py:urlize
```

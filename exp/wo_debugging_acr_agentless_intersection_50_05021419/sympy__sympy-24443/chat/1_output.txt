To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that the `_check_homomorphism` function properly handles permutation groups, particularly when dealing with inverted generators. The issue is related to the function `_image()` within the `homomorphisms.py` file in the Sympy project. Examining the specific code lines mentioned (336-337) and understanding the `_image()` function in detail is necessary for generating a patch. 

I need to retrieve the source code of the `_image()` function. Knowing the file path is `sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py`, I will search for the `_image()` function within this file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py", "_image")
```

To address the issue, I need to locate the part of the Django project responsible for generating migration files. This functionality is usually contained within the Django management commands or related components. Specifically, it involves the methods or classes handling migration file creation where import statement handling is performed.

I suspect the relevant code resides within the Django core files related to migrations, possibly within the `django.db.migrations` package or associated management commands.

Given that no specific file path is referenced, I'll start by searching for migration commands and the logic for file generation related to migration.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("write_migration_file")
search_method_in_codebase("generate_migration")
search_class_in_codebase("MigrationWriter")
search_class_in_codebase("Migration")
```

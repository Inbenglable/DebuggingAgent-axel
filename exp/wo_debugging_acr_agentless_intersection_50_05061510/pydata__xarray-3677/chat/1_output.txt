To address the issue, I need to gather information on the `merge` method from the relevant file, which appears to be located in `xarray/core/dataset.py`. To gain a better understanding of how this method operates and interacts with `DataArray`, I'll start by retrieving its source code.

```python
search_method_in_file("xarray/core/dataset.py", "Dataset.merge")
```

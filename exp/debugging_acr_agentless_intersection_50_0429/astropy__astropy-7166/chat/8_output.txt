To address the issue of inheriting docstrings for properties in the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass, we need to adjust the logic in the `__init__` method. Specifically, we need to add a condition to check for properties and apply the same inheritance process as done for functions. Below is the patch that represents the modification to the code:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### astropy/utils/misc.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            if (inspect.isfunction(val) and\n=======\n            if ((inspect.isfunction(val) or isinstance(val, property)) and\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch changes the condition in the loop inside the `__init__` method to check not only for functions (`inspect.isfunction(val)`) but also for properties (`isinstance(val, property)`), thereby ensuring that properties can inherit docstrings just like functions do.

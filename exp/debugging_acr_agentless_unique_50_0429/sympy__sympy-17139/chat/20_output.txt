Based on the test output before and after applying the patch, both outputs are identical, indicating that the patch did not address the underlying issue. The error occurs due to a `NameError` for the undefined variable `I`, which is unrelated to the TypeError caused by invalid comparison of complex numbers.

The patch itself attempts to fix the complex comparison issue by checking if `rv.exp` is real using the `is_real` property before performing any comparison. This seems like a reasonable approach to mitigate the TypeError for complex numbers.

However, since the test outputs are unchanged before and after the patch, and the error is due to a missing import of `I` from `sympy`, it suggests that the attempted fix was not correctly verified. The patch cannot be evaluated effectively unless the testing issue is addressed firstâ€”specifically, ensuring `I` is imported from `sympy`.

Therefore, without resolving the `NameError`, it isn't possible to verify the success of the patch. The reported issue regarding the comparison still remains unresolved given the current test setup.

Issue resolved: `False`

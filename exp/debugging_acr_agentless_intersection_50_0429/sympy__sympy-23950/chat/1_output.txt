Based on the issue description and the provided stack trace, we can see that the `Contains.as_set()` method is returning a `Contains` object when it should be returning an actual set. This is causing an `AttributeError` because the `Contains` object does not have an `as_relational` method, which is expected by the `Piecewise` class.

The `Contains` class, which is responsible for the `as_set` method, is likely defined somewhere within the Sympy codebase. We need to investigate the `Contains` class to identify the implementation of `as_set` and understand why it returns a `Contains` object instead of a set.

The stack trace doesn't directly show the invocation of `as_set()`, as it's a higher-level utility in Sympy. However, this issue relates to how `Contains` is converting to a set.

Observed method: `sympy/sets/contains.py:Contains.as_set`

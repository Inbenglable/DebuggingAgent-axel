To determine which of the API returned contents are needed for resolving the issue, let's analyze each one based on their context:

1. **sympy/physics/units/quantities.py:Quantity._collect_factor_and_dimension**
   - This method is a deprecated wrapper and simply redirects the call to the `UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension` method. It includes a deprecation warning advising that the function has moved to the `UnitSystem` class. This does not directly contribute to understanding or solving the issue because it is deprecated.

2. **sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py:UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension**
   - This method is the implementation that's currently in use and it contains logic for collecting the factor and dimension of different types of expressions. It handles various expression types like `Quantity`, `Mul`, `Pow`, `Add`, `Derivative`, `Function`, `Dimension`, and others. Importantly, it contains the logic to detect if an exponent is dimensionless, which is crucial for addressing the issue.

Based on this analysis, the relevant content is:

```
sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py:UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension
```

To resolve the issue, I've analyzed the `_sparse_fit` method from the retrieved code. It's evident that the problem lies in the calculation of `dual_coef_indptr`, particularly the division `dual_coef_indices.size / n_class`, which causes a `ZeroDivisionError` when `support_vectors_` is empty, leading `n_SV` to be zero.

To generate a patch, I need to handle the case where there are no support vectors gracefully by modifying the code around this logic. Given that I already have the necessary source code for the `_sparse_fit` method, I am now ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

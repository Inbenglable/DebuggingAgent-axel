To address the issue, I need to locate and understand the method responsible for writing tables in HTML format, particularly where the formatting is applied. This involves looking into where the `formats` parameter is handled in the context of HTML output. Iâ€™ll search for relevant methods across the codebase that might be related to the HTML writing functionality.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("write")
search_method_in_codebase("write_html")
```

To resolve the issue with `UsernameValidator`, we need to locate the regex in the implementations of `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator`. These are likely classes within the Django `contrib.auth.validators` module. 

I will search for these classes directly in the codebase to find their implementation and identify the exact location where the regex needs to be updated.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ASCIIUsernameValidator")
search_class_in_codebase("UnicodeUsernameValidator")
```

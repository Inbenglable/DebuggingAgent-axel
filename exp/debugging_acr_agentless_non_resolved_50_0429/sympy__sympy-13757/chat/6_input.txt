Multiplying an expression by a Poly does not evaluate when the expression is on the left side of the multiplication
Tested in Python 3.4 64-bit and 3.6 64-bit
Version: 1.1.2.dev0
```
>>> Poly(x)*x
Poly(x**2, x, domain='ZZ')

>>> x*Poly(x)
x*Poly(x, x, domain='ZZ')

>>> -2*Poly(x)
Poly(-2*x, x, domain='ZZ')

>>> S(-2)*Poly(x)
-2*Poly(x, x, domain='ZZ')

>>> Poly(x)*S(-2)
Poly(-2*x, x, domain='ZZ')
```

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
The issue in the **sympy** project is that multiplying a symbolic expression by a `Poly` object does not simplify as expected when the expression is on the left side of the multiplication. The test case highlights this by trying to evaluate `x * Poly(x)` and expecting it to return `Poly(x**2, x, domain='ZZ')`, but instead, it remains as `x * Poly(x, x, domain='ZZ')`.

To find the root cause, the trace execution provided shows the steps taken when evaluating the different test cases. It particularly shows how multiplication involving `Poly` objects is processed.

Analyzing the trace, the `__mul__` method for `Poly` is triggered correctly when `Poly(x) * x` is evaluated, leading to evaluation and simplification of the expression. On the other hand, when `x * Poly(x)` is evaluated, it triggers the `Expr.__mul__` via the decorator `__sympifyit_wrapper` instead of using `Poly.__mul__`. This suggests that the binary operation's method resolution order is impacting the multiplication, potentially due to operator overriding behavior in SymPy.

It seems the multiplication requires handling in the non-`Poly` class (which here ends up going through the generic `Expr` class) to force it to interact correctly with `Poly` objects when other symbolic expressions appear on the left.

Based on what was observed in the trace, further inspection is needed to see whether additional logic is necessary to handle multiplication between `Expr` and `Poly`.

Observed method: `sympy/core/expr.py:Expr.__mul__`
==================================================
Upon analyzing the provided runtime information for the method `Expr.__mul__`, we observe that this method is responsible for handling multiplication involving an `Expr` object. The issue arises because when an expression like `x * Poly(x)` is evaluated, it does not trigger `Poly.__mul__`, and instead, it's handled by `Expr.__mul__`, resulting in `x * Poly(x, x, domain='ZZ')` rather than simplifying to `Poly(x**2, x, domain='ZZ')`.

**Current observation and abnormal behavior analysis:**
- The method `Expr.__mul__` simply calls `Mul(self, other)` without additional conditions or checks for when `other` might be a `Poly` object.
- The operation priority (`_op_priority`) of `Expr` is set to 10.0, which seems to be allowing regular expressions to handle the operation first, before letting `Poly` object methods take over.
- To correct the behavior, special handling is potentially needed, or `Poly` should ideally take precedence when multiplication involves these objects.

Given these observations, we need to ensure that multiplication involving `Poly` on the right side is handled appropriately by forcing it to trigger `Poly.__mul__`.

**Next Steps:**
To further understand how multiplication should be correctly passed to `Poly.__mul__`, it makes sense to inspect `Mul(self, other)`, which is called inside `Expr.__mul__`:

**Observed scope: `sympy/core/mul.py:Mul`**

This scope should clarify how multiplication is being handled currently, and how the precedence or operator resolution order influences the process. Let's proceed by examining this function.
==================================================
Based on the analysis of the `Mul.flatten()` method, the abnormal program behavior seems to stem from how SymPy processes multiplication involving `Expr` and `Poly` objects. Specifically, the method tends to treat `Poly` as part of the commutative powers (`c_powers`), and there might be insufficient logic to detect if a `Poly` is involved in the multiplication to invoke proper handling or prioritization when the expression (such as `x`) appears first in the multiplication.

To handle this correctly and ensure `Poly.__mul__` is used in such cases, the `Mul.flatten` logic should recognize when `Poly` is part of the sequence and apply specific handling to ensure its multiplication form takes precedence.

We've seen how different cases work correctly when certain operation orders are used, indicating that method resolution order and commutative detection need refinement regarding `Poly`.

Given this analysis, a potential solution involves modifying `Mul.flatten` where detection and processing of `Poly` within `seq` can prioritize multiplication appropriately.

Further inspection into how `Mul` instances with `Poly` are flattened or detected may resolve this discrepancy. Specifically, code that detects and processes commutative terms and their powers can potentially be adjusted for special handling of `Poly`.

Thus, the buggy method and code that potentially require inspection are in:

```plaintext
Buggy method: `sympy/core/mul.py:Mul.flatten`
```

Here, adjustments need to be made so that `Poly` objects within multiplication sequences are evaluated appropriately, especially when the multiplication involves other symbolic expressions such as `Expr`.

        Notes
        =====
            * In an expression like ``a*b*c``, python process this through sympy
              as ``Mul(Mul(a, b), c)``. This can have undesirable consequences.

              -  Sometimes terms are not combined as one would like:
                 {c.f. https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/4596}

                >>> from sympy import Mul, sqrt
                >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z
                >>> 2*(x + 1) # this is the 2-arg Mul behavior
                2*x + 2
                >>> y*(x + 1)*2
                2*y*(x + 1)
                >>> 2*(x + 1)*y # 2-arg result will be obtained first
                y*(2*x + 2)
                >>> Mul(2, x + 1, y) # all 3 args simultaneously processed
                2*y*(x + 1)
                >>> 2*((x + 1)*y) # parentheses can control this behavior
                2*y*(x + 1)

                Powers with compound bases may not find a single base to
                combine with unless all arguments are processed at once.
                Post-processing may be necessary in such cases.
                {c.f. https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/5728}

                >>> a = sqrt(x*sqrt(y))
                >>> a**3
                (x*sqrt(y))**(3/2)
                >>> Mul(a,a,a)
                (x*sqrt(y))**(3/2)
                >>> a*a*a
                x*sqrt(y)*sqrt(x*sqrt(y))
                >>> _.subs(a.base, z).subs(z, a.base)
                (x*sqrt(y))**(3/2)

              -  If more than two terms are being multiplied then all the
                 previous terms will be re-processed for each new argument.
                 So if each of ``a``, ``b`` and ``c`` were :class:`Mul`
                 expression, then ``a*b*c`` (or building up the product
                 with ``*=``) will process all the arguments of ``a`` and
                 ``b`` twice: once when ``a*b`` is computed and again when
                 ``c`` is multiplied.

                 Using ``Mul(a, b, c)`` will process all arguments once.

            * The results of Mul are cached according to arguments, so flatten
              will only be called once for ``Mul(a, b, c)``. If you can
              structure a calculation so the arguments are most likely to be
              repeats then this can save time in computing the answer. For
              example, say you had a Mul, M, that you wished to divide by ``d[i]``
              and multiply by ``n[i]`` and you suspect there are many repeats
              in ``n``. It would be better to compute ``M*n[i]/d[i]`` rather
              than ``M/d[i]*n[i]`` since every time n[i] is a repeat, the
              product, ``M*n[i]`` will be returned without flattening -- the
              cached value will be returned. If you divide by the ``d[i]``
              first (and those are more unique than the ``n[i]``) then that will
              create a new Mul, ``M/d[i]`` the args of which will be traversed
              again when it is multiplied by ``n[i]``.

              {c.f. https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/5706}

              This consideration is moot if the cache is turned off.

            NB
            --
              The validity of the above notes depends on the implementation
              details of Mul and flatten which may change at any time. Therefore,
              you should only consider them when your code is highly performance
              sensitive.

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

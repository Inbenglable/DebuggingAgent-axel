The error `django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet.` clearly indicates that the Django application registry is not ready when the script attempts to define or use the `TestModel`. This error arises because the proper Django initialization sequence, particularly calling `django.setup()`, is not invoked before model definition. 

Given the traceback and runtime information from `reproduce.py`, it looks like:

1. **Settings Configuration (`LazySettings.configure`)**: Successfully sets the configuration for the settings, but the necessary step `django.setup()` for loading applications is missing.
2. **Model Definition Exception (`ModelBase.__new__`)**: An attempt to create `TestModel` resulted in an `AppRegistryNotReady` exception due to incomplete application readiness.

The root cause appears to be missing Django initialization before defining models. The model definition requires a fully initialized app registry which hasn't been established due to the absence of `django.setup()`.

Thus, the fix should involve properly initializing Django. Typically, this is done right after configuring settings and before defining models or running any Django specific code.

The next step involves looking at how the Django environment setup should be performed right before testing, focusing on the actual sequence or place where `django.setup()` is expected to be called.

Buggy method: `reproduce.py:missing_django_setup` (implied before `TestModel` definition; actual adjustment needed inside the script outside a specific method or after settings configuration)

The issue with the "Bases" section in the documentation seems to be related to how the base classes are being formatted in the `add_directive_header` method of the `ClassDocumenter` class. Specifically, the issue might be arising from the `restify(cls)` operation, which is being used to format base class names.

Given that I have identified the `add_directive_header` method and suspect the `restify(cls)` operation might be causing the problem, I need to understand how `restify` works and possibly adjust its behavior.

I will search for the `restify` function to get its implementation details, which will help in making necessary adjustments to ensure that the base class is correctly formatted.

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py", "restify")
```

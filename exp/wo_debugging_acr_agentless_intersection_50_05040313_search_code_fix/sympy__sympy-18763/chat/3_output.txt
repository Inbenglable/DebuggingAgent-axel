To resolve the parenthesizing issue, I need to examine the `_print_Subs` method in the `LatexPrinter` class, as this method is responsible for generating the LaTeX representation of `Subs` objects. This method is crucial for understanding how `Subs` expressions are currently formatted and where parentheses need to be added. I'll proceed to retrieve the relevant method's source code.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/latex.py", "LatexPrinter._print_Subs")
```

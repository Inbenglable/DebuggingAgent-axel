To address the issue, I need to retrieve the source code where the `merge` method is implemented because the problem seems to be related to how attributes are handled during the merging process. This process likely occurs in a file related to core operations like merging datasets within the **xarray** project. The given reference points to `xarray/core/merge.py`, specifically around line 504, indicating that this is where relevant operations likely occur.

To ensure I get the correct context on how attributes are being processed in the `merge` function, I'll perform the following search:

```python
search_method_in_file("xarray/core/merge.py", "merge")
```

You are a PR reviewer that needs to review the patch generated by a bug repair agent and determine whether the issue is fixed or not.
This is the bug issue, which is in the **sympy** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
SI._collect_factor_and_dimension() cannot properly detect that exponent is dimensionless
How to reproduce:

```python
from sympy import exp
from sympy.physics import units
from sympy.physics.units.systems.si import SI

expr = units.second / (units.ohm * units.farad)
dim = SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(expr)[1]

assert SI.get_dimension_system().is_dimensionless(dim)

buggy_expr = 100 + exp(expr)
SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(buggy_expr)

# results in ValueError: Dimension of "exp(second/(farad*ohm))" is Dimension(time/(capacitance*impedance)), but it should be Dimension(1)
```

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
## REPRODUCE TEST
```
from sympy import exp
from sympy.physics import units
from sympy.physics.units.systems.si import SI
import traceback
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    expr = units.second / (units.ohm * units.farad)
    dim = SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(expr)[1]

    assert SI.get_dimension_system().is_dimensionless(dim)

    buggy_expr = 100 + exp(expr)
    try:
        SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(buggy_expr)
    except ValueError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue is present: Dimension of exp(second/(farad*ohm)) is not correctly identified as dimensionless.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

And this is the original output when running the test (before applying the patch):

The repair agent has tried to generate a patch to fix the issue:
## PATCH CONTEXT
<PATCH_CONTEXT>
To address the issue with the `UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension` method not detecting dimensionless exponents properly in the `sympy` project, we will make an edit to ensure that functions with dimensioned arguments check explicitly for dimensionlessness before proceeding. Here's how we can patch the code:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        elif isinstance(expr, Function):\n            fds = [self._collect_factor_and_dimension(\n                arg) for arg in expr.args]\n            return (expr.func(*(f[0] for f in fds)),\n                    *(d[1] for d in fds))\n=======\n        elif isinstance(expr, Function):\n            fds = [self._collect_factor_and_dimension(\n                arg) for arg in expr.args]\n            if all(self.get_dimension_system().is_dimensionless(d[1]) for d in fds):\n                return expr.func(*(f[0] for f in fds)), Dimension(1)\n            return (expr.func(*(f[0] for f in fds)),\n                    *(d[1] for d in fds))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation:
- We modified the `Function` clause in `_collect_factor_and_dimension` to include a dimensionless check for all dimensions in the function's arguments (denoted `fds`).
- If all argument dimensions are dimensionless, we return `Dimension(1)` to signify that the function result is indeed dimensionless.
- Otherwise, we continue with the original behavior, returning dimensions of the function arguments. 

This patch should ensure that functions like `exp` properly handle dimensionless inputs, resolving the raised issue.

To resolve the issue with the `sylow_subgroup` method in the `sympy` project, I need to retrieve the source code for the `sylow_subgroup` method and possibly the `minimal_blocks` method since the error is originating from there. Additionally, I may need to look at the `PermutationGroup` class to understand more about the structure where this error occurs.

I will start by searching for the `sylow_subgroup` method and the `minimal_blocks` method in the `perm_groups.py` file. Also, since the class mentioned is `PermutationGroup`, I will try to retrieve the class code to better understand the context in which these methods operate.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/perm_groups.py", "PermutationGroup.sylow_subgroup")
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/perm_groups.py", "PermutationGroup.minimal_blocks")
search_class_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/perm_groups.py", "PermutationGroup")
```

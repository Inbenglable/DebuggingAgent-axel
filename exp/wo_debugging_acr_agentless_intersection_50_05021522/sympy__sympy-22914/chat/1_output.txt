To fix the issue reported, I need to add methods _print_Min and _print_Max to the PythonCodePrinter class. I need to verify the location of this class in the codebase before proceeding with the patch, as I need to know exactly where to add the new methods in the existing class structure. Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code for the `PythonCodePrinter` class.
 
I will proceed with searching for the `PythonCodePrinter` class definition in the codebase to find this information. 

```python
search_class_in_codebase("PythonCodePrinter")
```

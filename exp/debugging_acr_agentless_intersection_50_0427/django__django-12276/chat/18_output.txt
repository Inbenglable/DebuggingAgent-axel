To address the issue of the 'required' attribute being improperly added when initial data exists for a `FileInput`, I need to add a `use_required_attribute` method in the `FileInput` class. This method will mimic the behavior seen in the `ClearableFileInput` class. Here's the patch to implement the required functionality:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/forms/widgets.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass FileInput(Input):\n=======\nclass FileInput(Input):\n    def use_required_attribute(self, initial):\n        return super().use_required_attribute(initial) and not initial\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

In this patch, I've added the `use_required_attribute` method to the `FileInput` class to ensure the 'required' attribute is not used when initial data is present, thereby aligning its behavior with `ClearableFileInput`.

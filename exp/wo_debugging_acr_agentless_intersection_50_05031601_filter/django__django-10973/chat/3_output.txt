To resolve the issue, I need to find the source code for the method responsible for invoking the subprocess within the `django.db.backends.postgres.client` module. Based on the API search results:

1. **tests/gis_tests/test_measure.py:run**:
   - This `run` method is related to running a test suite using `unittest.TextTestRunner` and does not involve subprocess invocation with an emphasis on setting environment variables like `PGPASSWORD` for PostgreSQL. Hence, this is not relevant for the issue related to subprocess invocation in the PostgreSQL backend client.

2. **django/core/servers/basehttp.py:run**:
   - This `run` method is related to running a server and also does not involve subprocess invocation relevant to PostgreSQL client operations. This method is concerned with setting up and running a WSGI server with threading options, so it is also not relevant.

Since neither of the results pertains to the invocation of subprocesses in the specific context we are interested in (i.e., `django.db.backends.postgres.client` involving setting `PGPASSWORD`), neither of these results is needed for resolving the described issue. Therefore, there are no relevant contents to choose from the API returned list.

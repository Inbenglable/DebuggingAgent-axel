Based on the analysis of the current scope and the information provided, it appears that the issue originates from how the request method is being handled as a Unicode string within the `PreparedRequest.prepare` method. From the traceback and the analysis steps:

- The `prepare` method is responsible for preparing various components of the request, including the method, using the `self.prepare_method(method)` call.
- Given that the issue relates to the handling of a Unicode `method`, and appears during HTTP message construction, the `prepare_method` part inside `PreparedRequest.prepare` is a promising location for the bug.

To identify the specific location where the Unicode string handling is problematic, let's proceed by examining the `prepare_method` specifically, as this is where the method string is initially processed.

Observed method: `requests.models:PreparedRequest.prepare_method`

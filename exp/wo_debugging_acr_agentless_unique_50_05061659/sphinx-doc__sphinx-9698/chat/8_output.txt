Based on the information gathered, I have identified the code responsible for generating the index entries for `py:property` and `py:method` directives. The rationale for the issue is within the `get_index_text` method of `PyProperty` that ensures correct format for the index entries, however does not accurately handle the `py:method` directive with `:property:` option.

I need to fix the formatting for the index entries generated by `py:method` when using the `:property:` option. The `get_index_text` method for `PyProperty` can be modified to address this, and the `add_target_and_index` method should reflect this change accordingly.

Since both methods have been retrieved, I am ready to generate the patch without needing additional sources.

Ready generation: `True`

To resolve the issue with the `trim_docstring` function, we need to adjust the way indentation is calculated by excluding the first line from consideration. Here's the patch that should be applied:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())\n=======\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch skips the first line when calculating the indentation, addressing the original problem while maintaining the overall function's integrity.

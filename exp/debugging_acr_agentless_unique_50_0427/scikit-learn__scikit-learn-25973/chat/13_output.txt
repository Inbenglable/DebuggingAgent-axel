The initial issue in the **scikit-learn** project involves the `SequentialFeatureSelector` failing to handle an iterable of splits (specifically a generator) provided as the `cv` argument. The error encountered is an `IndexError`, indicating that the list index is out of range during score aggregation.

### Review of the Patch:
The patch introduces a modification to the `SequentialFeatureSelector.fit` method by converting the `cv` argument to a list if it's iterable but not already a list. This change ensures that the cross-validation splits are reusable throughout the fitting process, addressing the root cause of the bug.

### Analysis of the Test Outputs:

- **Original Output**:
  Before applying the patch, the test reproduces the issue. The `SequentialFeatureSelector` causes an `IndexError` during its operation when using the iterable of splits.

- **Patched Output**:
  After the patch is applied, the test outputs "The issue is fixed" and successfully completes without raising any exceptions. This indicates that the iterable splits are correctly converted to a list, preventing exhaustion, and allowing the fitting process to execute without errors.

Given the patch implementation and the modified behavior reflected in the test output, the issue seems to be resolved effectively. The conversion of `cv` to a list ensures that the splits are preserved and can be iterated over multiple times during cross-validation-related computations.

**Conclusion**:
Issue resolved: `True`

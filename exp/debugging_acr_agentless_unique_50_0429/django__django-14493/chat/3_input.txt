You need to trace the abnormal program to resolve project issues and submit pull requests.
Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
ManifestStaticFilesStorage crashes with max_post_process_passes = 0.
Description
	
To reproduce:
Derive a custom class from ManifestStaticFilesStorage and set max_post_process_passes to 0:
class MyManifestStaticFilesStorage(ManifestStaticFilesStorage):
	max_post_process_passes = 0
# settings.py
STATICFILES_STORAGE = "MyManifestStaticFilesStorage"
run collectstatic
 File "lib/python3.7/site-packages/django/contrib/staticfiles/management/commands/collectstatic.py", line 188, in handle
	collected = self.collect()
 File "lib/python3.7/site-packages/django/contrib/staticfiles/management/commands/collectstatic.py", line 128, in collect
	for original_path, processed_path, processed in processor:
 File "lib/python3.7/site-packages/django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py", line 403, in post_process
	yield from super().post_process(*args, **kwargs)
 File "lib/python3.7/site-packages/django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py", line 251, in post_process
	if substitutions:
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'substitutions' referenced before assignment
The error can also be seen easily in the code: ​https://github.com/django/django/blob/a0a5e0f4c83acdfc6eab69754e245354689c7185/django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py#L246-L257
subtitutions is only set if the loop is entered at least once.
(The motivation to set max_post_process_passes to 0 is to have Django not produce invalid CSS as described here: https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/21080#comment:19 )

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
import os
import sys
import traceback
from django.conf import settings
from django.core.management import call_command
from django.contrib.staticfiles.storage import ManifestStaticFilesStorage

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

class MyManifestStaticFilesStorage(ManifestStaticFilesStorage):
    max_post_process_passes = 0

def main():
    # Set up Django settings for the test
    settings.configure(
        DEBUG=True,
        STATIC_URL='/static/',
        STATIC_ROOT=os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'staticfiles'),
        STATICFILES_STORAGE='__main__.MyManifestStaticFilesStorage',
        INSTALLED_APPS=[
            'django.contrib.staticfiles',
        ],
    )

    try:
        # Run collectstatic command
        call_command('collectstatic', interactive=False, clear=True, verbosity=0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("collectstatic failed with an UnboundLocalError due to max_post_process_passes = 0")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()


This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
The error starts when running the `collectstatic` command, which results in a traceback indicating an "Apps aren't loaded yet" exception due to the application registry not being ready. This suggests that the Django application setup may not be completed before calling the `collectstatic` command. However, this is a preliminary check, and not necessarily linked to the main issue reported—`max_post_process_passes` set to 0 causing an `UnboundLocalError`.

Considering the original issue is likely within the `ManifestStaticFilesStorage` class, and understanding that the exception traceback eventually resulted in the UnboundLocalError when max_post_process_passes was set to 0, we should focus on inspecting the `post_process` method in the storage class to locate where the `substitutions` variable is managed.

Therefore, the next method to observe is:

Observed method: `django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py:ManifestStaticFilesStorage.post_process`
==================================================
The described issue occurs when the `collectstatic` command is executed in a Django project where `max_post_process_passes` is set to 0 in a custom subclass of `ManifestStaticFilesStorage`. The error specifically originates from an `UnboundLocalError` that occurs in the `post_process` method of `ManifestStaticFilesStorage`.

According to the traceback and issue description, the culprit likely lies in a segment of the code that erroneously assumes that the `substitutions` variable is always initialized, which is not the case when no iterations occur due to `max_post_process_passes = 0`.

The immediate next step would be to further inspect the main location suspected of causing the issue within the following segment of the `django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py` file.

This part of the code involves a decision structure where `substitutions` is expected to be defined.

Considering you suspected the issue is around `substitutions`, let's dive deeper into the method in question:

Observed scope: `django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py:246-257` 

We need to carefully examine this segment to identify where `substitutions` is assumed to be initialized and perhaps devise a conditional assignment or null check. This will help rectify the error and allow setting `max_post_process_passes = 0` without triggering an `UnboundLocalError`.
==================================================


Now you choose ManifestFilesMixin.post_process's code snippet 
   246	        adjustable_paths = [
   247	            path for path in paths
   248	            if matches_patterns(path, self._patterns)
   249	        ]
   250	
   251	        # Adjustable files to yield at end, keyed by the original path.
   252	        processed_adjustable_paths = {}
   253	
   254	        # Do a single pass first. Post-process all files once, yielding not
   255	        # adjustable files and exceptions, and collecting adjustable files.
   256	        for name, hashed_name, processed, _ in self._post_process(paths, adjustable_paths, hashed_files):
   257	            if name not in adjustable_paths or isinstance(processed, Exception):

for further observation, tracing the abnormal program behavior.

This is the runtime information of the code snippet you choose to observed in ManifestFilesMixin.post_process:

You need to trace the abnormal program behavior step by step to identify the root cause of the bug and locate the buggy method that contains the code to be fixed.
Now, please first analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior. 

Then, if you can already locate the buggy method and buggy code, reply with:
Buggy method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Otherwise, continue tracing by selecting the next method to observe. Reply with: 
Observed method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Note that {FILE_PATH} refers to the path relative to the repository. And if you want to observe a method inside a class, please specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME.

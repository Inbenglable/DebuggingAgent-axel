The output demonstrates that the separability matrix of the nested compound model is not as expected. Specifically, the blocks of the matrix corresponding to `<Linear1D>` models are incorrectly marked as non-separable with respect to other components, despite being logically independent.

Given the observed misbehavior, let's analyze the `separability_matrix` method in `astropy/modeling/separable.py` further. However, since the issue may lie deeper in how separability is computed recursively within compound models, we should first look into the `_separable` helper function, which is responsible for computing the separability.

The abnormal behavior observed here is tied to the function `Axes.hist` in the file `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py`. The issue appears when using the `density=True` parameter along with a given `range=(0, 1)` in a call to `plt.hist()`. The expectation is that the first and last bin edges should match the specified range. However, this expectation is not being met.

Upon reviewing the code, particularly around lines 6687-6690, we see that a dictionary `hist_kwargs` is conditionally set based on the `density` flag. The `range` parameter appears to be either computed or set earlier, around line 6685. This parameter is supposed to control the bin edges; however, its handling might not correctly ensure that the edges coincide with the specified range when `density=True`.

The part that likely entails a problem is around how the `np.histogram` function is called (line 6698). The `hist_kwargs` is passed to `np.histogram`, and if this contains unexpected values or doesn't properly reflect the desired range when `density=True`, it would result in incorrect bins as we are witnessing.

To better identify the issue, we need to examine how the `hist_kwargs` dictionary and the `bin_range` variable are built and used, and specifically how they affect the `np.histogram` call when `density=True`.

Let's look deeper into this function and inspect how `bin_range` and `hist_kwargs` are constructed, particularly noticing any influence of the `density` parameter.

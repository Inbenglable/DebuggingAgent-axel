To address the issue mentioned, we are interested in understanding how pytest manages test skipping, particularly when the `--pdb` option is enabled. The `pytest_configure` function in the `src/_pytest/skipping.py` file specifically deals with the configuration and setup of skipping logic in pytest, which might interact with the `--pdb` option.

The `pytest_configure` hooks in other files appear to deal with unrelated functionalities such as logging, terminal reporting, XML reporting, etc., except for those dealing specifically with skipping, debugging, or configurations directly influencing the skipping behavior in pytest.

Therefore, the relevant content from the API invocation that can help in resolving the issue is:

```
src/_pytest/skipping.py:pytest_configure
```

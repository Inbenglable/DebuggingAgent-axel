To fix the issue in the `sympy` project, we will make a slight modification to add an `else` clause that raises a `NotImplementedError` in the `evalf` function when neither `re` nor `im` have been handled, thereby preventing an `UnboundLocalError`. Here's the patch for this:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/core/evalf.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            r = re, im, reprec, imprec\n=======\n            else:\n                raise NotImplementedError('Evaluation of this combination is not implemented, please check the arguments.')\n            r = re, im, reprec, imprec\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

With this change, the code will now explicitly check that `reprec` and `imprec` have been assigned before using them, ensuring that any scenarios where they are not assigned raise a clearer error. This modification helps in understanding where the `NotImplementedError` originates if the current implementation does not handle specific cases of evaluation.

To resolve the issue with the incorrect rendering of a 1-element tuple, I need to determine where in the Sphinx codebase the tuple is being rendered or formatted for display. This will likely involve examining a method responsible for rendering or interpreting tuples. Since the issue is a follow-up to a previous issue (#7964), it suggests continuity or reliance on existing functionality that might have been adjusted.

I will first search for the location or function responsible for handling tuple rendering or converting tuples to their string representations. 

Given the information about a previous fix in #8265 and the test case being added in `tests/test_pycode_ast.py`, I will check for relevant logic possibly in the AST handling or related modules, which might be a good starting point to identify the method or part of the code handling this tuple representation.

Let's check the related files or methods that might be executing this logic.

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/pycode/ast.py", "visit_tuple")
search_method_in_file("sphinx/ext/autodoc/type_comment.py", "safe_repr")
search_code_in_file("tests/test_pycode_ast.py", "(1,)")
```

### Analysis of Observed Code and Abnormal Behavior

#### Observations:
1. **Expected vs Actual Permissions:**
   - The code attempts to set file permissions to `0o644` using `self.file_permissions_mode`.
   - The test asserts that expected permissions should be `0o644`, but permissions are actually set to `0o600` when using `TemporaryUploadedFile`.

2. **FileSystemStorage._save Method:**
   - It uses `os.chmod(full_path, self.file_permissions_mode)` to set permissions if `self.file_permissions_mode` is configured.
   - The `FileSystemStorage._save` method calls `file_move_safe()` when handling `TemporaryUploadedFile`, which moves the file from its temporary location.
   - `os.open()` with `0o666` and `os.chmod()` should set permissions correctly, but there is no call to `os.chmod()` after moving a temporary file.

#### Possible Root Cause:
The discrepancy arises because `os.chmod()` that sets the `self.file_permissions_mode` is only applied in the case of normal uploaded files when calling `os.open`. However, when the `TemporaryUploadedFile` is handled, the permissions set by `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` (`0o600`) persist because `file_move_safe()` does not alter them.

### Conclusion:
The buggy behavior is likely in how `TemporaryUploadedFile` permissions are handled. The piece of code which should perform a `chmod` to set the correct file permissions after moving a temporary file seems missing or ineffective.

### Next Step:
To further analyze the permission setting, we need to observe the downstream function or mechanism handling `file_move_safe()` and its aftermath in setting file permissions.

### Potential Buggy Method:
Since we've traced that `file_move_safe()` within `_save` does not alter permissions of temporary files, it may be within this function or immediately after it.

We now need to track for any permission modification after `file_move_safe()` has moved the file.

Observed scope: `django/core/files/storage.py:254-255`
I want to trace and understand the behavior of handling permissions after `file_move_safe()` is called.

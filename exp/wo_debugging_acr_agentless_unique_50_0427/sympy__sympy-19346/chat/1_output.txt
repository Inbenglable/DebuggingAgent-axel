In order to address the issue with `srepr` not handling `dict` and `set` objects properly, I need to examine the implementation of the `srepr` function to understand its current behavior. Therefore, the source code for the `srepr` function will be retrieved.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("srepr")
```

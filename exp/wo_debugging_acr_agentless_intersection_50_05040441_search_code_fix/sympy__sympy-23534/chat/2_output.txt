The retrieved code of the `symbols` function provides detailed insight into how it handles the creation of symbols and other symbol-like objects when using the `cls` parameter. The section we should focus on is the handling of the `names` variable, especially when the input is not a string but a sequence of strings (tuples). 

Given the information, invoking `symbols` recursively for each element in the tuple without passing the `cls` parameter is likely the root cause of the issue. This results in defaulting back to `Symbol` instead of the specified `Function` class.

To address this, we need to modify the code in the last part to ensure the `cls` parameter is forwarded in the recursive call, when `names` is a sequence.

I have gathered enough code to apply this patch. Therefore, I am ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

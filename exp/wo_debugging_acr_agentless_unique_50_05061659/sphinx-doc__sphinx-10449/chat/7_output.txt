**Patch Review:**

The patch modifies the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file, specifically the handling of method signatures within the code responsible for generating autodoc documentation. The changes target the class constructor (`__init__`), ensuring it does not display a return type in the documentation when the configuration `autodoc_typehints = "description"` is used.

**Analysis:**

1. **Patch Context:**
   - The search/replace operation checks if the `_signature_method_name` is `'__init__'` and then removes any return type from the signature with `sig = sig.split(' -> ')[0]`.
   - This approach effectively ensures that constructor signatures (`__init__`) do not display a return type annotation in the documentation, addressing the issue described.

2. **Original Output:**
   - The test output indicated that the documentation for the class constructor incorrectly included a return type ("Returns None"), confirming the presence of the issue initially.

3. **Patched Output:**
   - After applying the patch, the test script output states, "The issue is not present," meaning the specific check for "Returns None" did not find the problematic text in the generated documentation.
   - The test results suggest that the patch successfully prevented the display of the return type for the constructor, which aligns with the expected behavior described in the issue.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis, the patch indeed resolves the specific issue of the `autodoc_typehints = "description"` option causing autoclass to incorrectly include a return type for class constructors. The test outputs before and after the application of the patch confirm the resolution by showing the absence of the problematic return type in the documentation.

Issue resolved: `True`

To address the issue, we need to review the source code of the `CountVectorizer` class, specifically the `__init__` method, to identify how we can ensure the `vocabulary_` attribute is set when `vocabulary` is provided. This will help to prevent the `NotFittedError` in `get_feature_names`. Since I need to make changes to the initialization process, I will retrieve the `CountVectorizer.__init__` method source code first.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py", "CountVectorizer.__init__")
```

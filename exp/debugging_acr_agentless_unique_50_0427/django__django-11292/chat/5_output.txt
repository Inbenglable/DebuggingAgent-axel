From the information provided, the issue involves integrating a new command-line argument (`--skip-checks`) into Django's management commands. The error indicates the `--skip-checks` argument is not recognized when passed to a management command via the `CommandParser`.

Currently, we have transitioned to observing the initialization phase of `CommandParser` in the snippet from `django/core/management/base.py`:

```python
    45	def __init__(self, *, missing_args_message=None, called_from_command_line=None, **kwargs):
    46	    self.missing_args_message = missing_args_message
    47	    self.called_from_command_line = called_from_command_line
    48	    super().__init__(**kwargs)
```

### Analysis

1. **CommandParser Construction**: The `CommandParser` appears to inherit standard behavior from `argparse.ArgumentParser` through the `super().__init__(**kwargs)` call on line 48.

2. **Custom Argument Handling**: The presence of `missing_args_message` and `called_from_command_line` suggests this class is intended to provide customized error handling or startup logic, potentially initializing specific arguments.

3. **Abnormal Behavior**: The traceback related to `run_debugging_test.py` points to potential issues in an unrelated component (`dbgsnooper`), but does not provide direct insight into argument parsing within Django management commands. However, the error does tell us that `dbgsnooper` is trying but failing to trace through the argument parsing process.

### Next Steps

To further diagnose where the program is lacking in recognizing the `--skip-checks` option, the critical path will involve examining where and how arguments are typically registered or added to `CommandParser`. The initialization we currently observe does not directly manipulate or define command-line arguments beyond calling `super()`, hence it's necessary to investigate the broader lifecycle of command argument setup.

### Proposed Next Step

Investigate where specific command arguments (like `--skip-checks`) are defined and added to `CommandParser`. This will likely be visible in a section where command-specific configurations or additions are done.

Let's move to observe the creation or setup path of command-line arguments in the surrounding infrastructure:

- **Observed Method**: `django/core/management/base.py:BaseCommand.create_parser`

This method or its equivalent in the setup process might be where command options like `--skip-checks` are usually added.

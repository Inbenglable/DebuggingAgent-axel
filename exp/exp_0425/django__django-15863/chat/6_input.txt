Filter floatformat drops precision in decimal numbers
Description
	
I discovered that floatformat template filter may drop precision when used for Decimal numbers.
MWE:
from decimal import Decimal
from django import setup
from django.conf import settings
from django.template import Template, Context
TEMPLATES = [
	{
		'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
	},
]
settings.configure(TEMPLATES=TEMPLATES)
setup()
t = Template('{{ value|floatformat:20 }}')
c = Context({'value': Decimal('42.12345678901234567890')})
print(t.render(c)) #>>> 42.12345678901234400000
I traced the bug to incorrect conversion to Decimal within the floatformat implementation that can't really work for Decimal numbers. Decimal numbers are converted to float instead.

</ISSUE>


A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
To understand the abnormal behavior seen in this Django test script, I need to consider how the floatformat filter interacts with Decimal values. The issue is that when a Decimal value is passed through the floatformat filter, it loses precision and is converted to a float internally before being formatted. This conversion causes the loss of precision since the Decimal class supports higher precision than native Python floats.

Given the test script, the sequence of execution likely involves invoking the `floatformat` template filter when rendering the template. The filter is applying formatting to the Decimal in a manner that involves converting it first to a float, resulting in the loss of precision.

To locate the exact source of the issue, I should analyze how the `floatformat` filter is applied. I will observe the behavior within the context of the Django template engine using floatformat.

Observed method: `django/template/defaultfilters.py:floatformat`
==================================================
The issue originates from the handling of the `text` parameter within the `floatformat` function. The function is designed to convert the input `text` to a `Decimal` value via two steps. First, it attempts to create a `Decimal` directly from the string representation of `text`, and if that fails (`InvalidOperation`), it attempts to convert `text` to a float and then to a `Decimal`. This introduction of a float conversion causes a loss of precision when the value is large or has many decimal places. 

Looking at the trace for `floatformat`, it seems that the conversion to `Decimal` at line 155 succeeds without falling back to the float conversion (line 158). However, even when it creates a `Decimal` from the `repr(text)`, it's not maintaining the expected precision, suggesting the method used to convert `text` to a `Decimal` is still flawed or inadequate for high precision decimal values.

Now let's analyze if the conversion is happening correctly and trace any downstream usage of these converted values.

I want to further understand the critical parts of this conversion and formatting. Let's continue tracing from the point of conversion to check for further precision handling inaccuracies:

Observed scope: `django/template/defaultfilters.py:154-158`
==================================================
The `floatformat` function in `django/template/defaultfilters.py` converts input values to a `Decimal` for formatting purposes. The observed abnormal behavior occurs at line 155, where the code attempts to create a `Decimal` from the string representation of the `text` parameter using `repr(text)`. The runtime information shows that `input_val` is set to `"Decimal('42.12345678901234567890')"`, which leads to an `InvalidOperation` exception because `Decimal` cannot directly parse the `repr` output as it includes the class name along with the value.

The method then falls back to line 158, where it converts `text` to a float and then to a `Decimal`, resulting in the loss of precision observed in the output. The float conversion step effectively truncates the decimal precision beyond the floating-point limit, leading to the truncated output `42.12345678901234400000`.

The precision loss occurs because Python's float type does not have sufficient precision to maintain the full decimal value, especially when converting back to a `Decimal` from the `float`.

Given these observations, the buggy behavior stems from the incorrect handling in these lines, particularly with the conversion strategy leading to loss of precision.

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To generate a patch for the issue involving the `floatformat` function and the precision loss with `Decimal` values, I need to review the source code of the `floatformat` function in the `django/template/defaultfilters.py` file. Retrieving this method will allow me to precisely modify the conversion logic to maintain the precision of `Decimal` values.

I'll search for the `floatformat` method in the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/template/defaultfilters.py", "floatformat")
```

    Display a float to a specified number of decimal places.

    If called without an argument, display the floating point number with one
    decimal place -- but only if there's a decimal place to be displayed:

    * num1 = 34.23234
    * num2 = 34.00000
    * num3 = 34.26000
    * {{ num1|floatformat }} displays "34.2"
    * {{ num2|floatformat }} displays "34"
    * {{ num3|floatformat }} displays "34.3"

    If arg is positive, always display exactly arg number of decimal places:

    * {{ num1|floatformat:3 }} displays "34.232"
    * {{ num2|floatformat:3 }} displays "34.000"
    * {{ num3|floatformat:3 }} displays "34.260"

    there are places to be displayed:

    * {{ num1|floatformat:"-3" }} displays "34.232"
    * {{ num2|floatformat:"-3" }} displays "34"
    * {{ num3|floatformat:"-3" }} displays "34.260"

    If arg has the 'g' suffix, force the result to be grouped by the

    * {{ 6666.6666|floatformat:"2g" }} displays "6,666.67"
    * {{ 10000|floatformat:"g" }} displays "10,000"

    If arg has the 'u' suffix, force the result to be unlocalized. When the

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

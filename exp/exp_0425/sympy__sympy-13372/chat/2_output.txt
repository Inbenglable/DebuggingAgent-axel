To address the bug, I need to examine the `evalf` method within the `sympy/core/evalf.py` file. This will help me understand how `reprec` and `imprec` are being assigned and how to resolve the `UnboundLocalError`. I will retrieve the source code of the `evalf` method.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/core/evalf.py", "evalf")
```

In the observed code, a `ZeroDivisionError` is raised in the `_sparse_fit` method when fitting the SVR model with sparse data. The error occurs because the `dual_coef_indices.size / n_class` operation results in a float division by zero, likely due to `n_class` being zero when `support_vectors_` is empty.

Given that the error message is directly pointing to this spot in the `_sparse_fit` method, I can identify it as the location where the bug occurs.

Buggy method: `sklearn/svm/base.py:_sparse_fit`

To generate a patch, I must review the source code of the `_cstack` method in the `astropy/modeling/separable.py` file, as the analysis indicates this method potentially contains the logic flaw causing the incorrect behavior in separability computation for nested compound models.

I will retrieve the source code for the `_cstack` method to understand how the separation matrices for components are stacked and identify the necessary modifications to resolve the issue.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/modeling/separable.py", "_cstack")
```

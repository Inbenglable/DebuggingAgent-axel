## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Set default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.
Description
	
Hello,
As far as I can see, the ​File Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.
What I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).
The tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.
I found mentions of this issue ​on GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.

In the previous round, you called search APIs to retrieve relevant source code that would help identify the root cause of the issue and generate a patch. However, the code you retrieved appears in multiple locations (maybe some are irrelevant but have same key). So now your task is to determine which of the retrieved contents are indeed you need, and filter out the irrelevant ones.
This is your API invocation round output:
To address the issue of setting the default `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION` to `0o644`, I need to identify where in the Django codebase the file upload permissions are set or used. This is likely managed within the storage or upload handling mechanism of Django. I need to search for relevant methods that deal with file upload permissions in Django's `FileSystemStorage` or similar classes, which are responsible for handling file permissions during the upload process.

I'll start by searching for methods related to file upload handling within Django, focusing on `FileSystemStorage`.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("FileSystemStorage")
search_method_in_codebase("get_available_name")
search_method_in_codebase("save")
```

And this is the corresponding API returned result (each content is started with #### FILE_PATH:NAME):
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("get_available_name")
RESULT:
#### tests/file_storage/test_generate_filename.py:AWSS3Storage.get_available_name
```python
    def get_available_name(self, name, max_length=None):
        return name

```

#### tests/file_storage/tests.py:OverwritingStorage.get_available_name
```python
    def get_available_name(self, name, max_length=None):
        """Override the effort to find an used name."""
        return name

```

#### django/core/files/storage.py:Storage.get_available_name
```python
    def get_available_name(self, name, max_length=None):
        """
        Return a filename that's free on the target storage system and
        available for new content to be written to.
        """
        dir_name, file_name = os.path.split(name)
        file_root, file_ext = os.path.splitext(file_name)
        # If the filename already exists, add an underscore and a random 7
        # character alphanumeric string (before the file extension, if one
        # exists) to the filename until the generated filename doesn't exist.
        # Truncate original name if required, so the new filename does not
        # exceed the max_length.
        while self.exists(name) or (max_length and len(name) > max_length):
            # file_ext includes the dot.
            name = os.path.join(dir_name, "%s_%s%s" % (file_root, get_random_string(7), file_ext))
            if max_length is None:
                continue
            # Truncate file_root if max_length exceeded.
            truncation = len(name) - max_length
            if truncation > 0:
                file_root = file_root[:-truncation]
                # Entire file_root was truncated in attempt to find an available filename.
                if not file_root:
                    raise SuspiciousFileOperation(
                        'Storage can not find an available filename for "%s". '
                        'Please make sure that the corresponding file field '
                        'allows sufficient "max_length".' % name
                    )
                name = os.path.join(dir_name, "%s_%s%s" % (file_root, get_random_string(7), file_ext))
        return name

```



Among the API returned contents, there may be some irrelevant ones or not. So now you need to analyze each returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.
Now, please first analyze the API returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.

Then you need to choose you needed ones with the following format:
```
FILE_PATH_1:NAME_1
FILE_PATH_2:NAME_2
...
```

Note:
1. The value of FILE_PATH:NAME, must consistent with the API returned content (but remove the prefix ####).
2. You may select one or more contents, or even all of them if they are indeed you need.

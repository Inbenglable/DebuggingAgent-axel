To resolve the issue, I need to understand the code logic around the comparison in the file `fu.py`, especially focusing on the method where the error occurs. We need to examine specifically the `_f` function located at line 504 to see how to modify the comparison logic to handle complex numbers properly.

Therefore, the necessary step is to retrieve the source code of the `_f` method. It might also be beneficial to have a look at the class structure if `_f` is a method within a class.

```python
search_code_in_file("sympy/simplify/fu.py", "if (rv.exp < 0) == True:")
search_method_in_file("sympy/simplify/fu.py", "_f")
```

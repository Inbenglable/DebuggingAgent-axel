To resolve this issue, I need to examine the source code of the Sphinx `linkcheck` feature to understand how it processes HTTP responses and identifies anchors. Therefore, I need to retrieve the relevant source code responsible for this logic. First, let's identify where the `linkcheck` logic is implemented in the Sphinx project.

I'll begin by searching for methods related to "linkcheck" in the Sphinx codebase to locate the relevant files and classes.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("linkcheck")
```

Based on the analysis of the current observed code, the issue arises from the setup of command-line arguments for the `verbose` option. The runtime information indicates that when the short `-v` option is used, it expects an argument, which is not the intended behavior. The code in the `ArgumentsManager.__init__` method initializes the argument parser, but does not explicitly configure arguments.

However, the setup of individual arguments might occur later in this file or in another related component. The initialization does reference a method called `reset_parsers`, which could potentially involve the argument configuration. This method might provide insight into where the verbose options are incorrectly defined.

To investigate further and determine where the `-v` option is wrongly set to expect an argument, I would look at the `reset_parsers` method or functions related to the argument parser setup.

Hence, I will proceed to observe the code related to `reset_parsers` or similar configurations, as they could contain the definitions for the command-line options including the verbose setting.

Observed scope: `pylint/config/arguments_manager.py:88-89`

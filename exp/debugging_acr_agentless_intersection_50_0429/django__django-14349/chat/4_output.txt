To address this issue, I need to examine the source code of the `URLValidator.__call__` method in the `django/core/validators.py` file. By inspecting this method, I can determine how to introduce a preliminary step to reject URLs containing forbidden characters (LF, CR, or tabs) before further processing. Since I need the complete code context of this method to craft an appropriate patch, I'll retrieve the source code now.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/validators.py", "URLValidator.__call__")
```

Based on the analysis, the absence of setting `vocabulary_` in the `__init__` method is the root cause of the issue when a vocabulary is provided. To generate the patch, I need to modify the `__init__` method of the `CountVectorizer` class to initialize `self.vocabulary_` from the provided `vocabulary` parameter. Since I have already obtained this method's source code and identified the point of modification, I'm ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

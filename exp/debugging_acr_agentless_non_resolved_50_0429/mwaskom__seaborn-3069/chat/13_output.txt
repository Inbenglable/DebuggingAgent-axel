To determine whether the issue is resolved, let's analyze the patch and the test outputs:

### Patch Analysis:
1. **Patch Context**: The patch aims to correct the behavior of nominal scales by adjusting axis limits similarly to how categorical scales are adjusted.
2. **Code Changes**:
   - Introduced a helper function `is_nominal` to ascertain nominal type scales.
   - Adjusted the lower (`lo`) and upper (`hi`) bounds for axis limits if the value is nominal by extending them by 0.5 each.
   - This should cause ticks for nominal scales to be positioned similarly to categorical scales.

### Test Output Analysis:

**Original Output**: 
- The test failed, specifically when verifying that the nominal scale extends to +/- 0.5 from the first and last tick. This indicates the issue with axis limits.

**Patched Output**: 
- The test fails at the same check, meaning the nominal scale is still not drawn to +/- 0.5 from the first and last tick.

### Conclusion:
Despite the changes made, the patched output is the same as the original output, indicating that the issue with the nominal scale's axis limits has not been resolved. Therefore, the patch did not successfully change the behavior to accomplish the intended +/â€“ 0.5 range for nominal scales.

Issue resolved: `False`

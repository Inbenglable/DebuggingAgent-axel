You need to trace the abnormal program to resolve project issues and submit pull requests.
Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
#### ISSUE
Squashed migration is not marked as unapplied
Description
	 
		(last modified by Markus Holtermann)
	 
When unapplying a squashed migration and the replaced migration files are still around, the MigrationExecutor mark the squash migration as unapplied, too, not only the replaced migrations.


Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import migrations, connection
from django.db.migrations.loader import MigrationLoader
from django.db.migrations.recorder import MigrationRecorder
from django.db.migrations.migration import Migration

# Setup Django settings
settings.configure(
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': ':memory:',
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=['django.contrib.contenttypes'],
)
django.setup()

# Create a test migration that replaces two migrations
class TestMigration(Migration):
    replaces = [
        ('testapp', '0001_initial'),
        ('testapp', '0002_change')
    ]
    dependencies = []
    operations = []

    def __init__(self, name, app_label):
        super().__init__(name, app_label)

# Create a loader with our test migration
loader = MigrationLoader(connection, replace_migrations=True)
loader.disk_migrations = {
    ('testapp', '0001_squashed_0002'): TestMigration('0001_squashed_0002', 'testapp')
}

# Record the original migrations as applied
recorder = MigrationRecorder(connection)
recorder.ensure_schema()
recorder.record_applied('testapp', '0001_initial')
recorder.record_applied('testapp', '0002_change')

print("Initial state:")
print("Applied migrations:", recorder.applied_migrations())

# Build the graph
loader.build_graph()
print("\nAfter building graph:")
print("Applied migrations:", loader.applied_migrations)

# First record the squashed migration as applied
recorder.record_applied('testapp', '0001_squashed_0002')

print("\nAfter recording squashed migration:")
print("Applied migrations:", recorder.applied_migrations())

# Now unapply one of the replaced migrations
recorder.record_unapplied('testapp', '0002_change')

# Rebuild the graph
loader = MigrationLoader(connection, replace_migrations=True)
loader.disk_migrations = {
    ('testapp', '0001_squashed_0002'): TestMigration('0001_squashed_0002', 'testapp')
}
loader.build_graph()

print("\nAfter unapplying one replaced migration:")
print("Applied migrations:", loader.applied_migrations)

# Now unapply the other replaced migration
recorder.record_unapplied('testapp', '0001_initial')

# Rebuild the graph
loader = MigrationLoader(connection, replace_migrations=True)
loader.disk_migrations = {
    ('testapp', '0001_squashed_0002'): TestMigration('0001_squashed_0002', 'testapp')
}
loader.build_graph()

print("\nAfter unapplying both replaced migrations:")
print("Applied migrations:", loader.applied_migrations)


This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
The abnormal program behavior we observe in the output shows that:

1. Initially, both `0001_initial` and `0002_change` migrations are applied.
2. After building the graph, the same set of migrations are still marked as applied.
3. When `0001_squashed_0002` is recorded as applied, it is properly added to the list of applied migrations.
4. After unapplying `0002_change`, the squashed migration `0001_squashed_0002` is still considered applied along with `0001_initial`.
5. Finally, when both `0001_initial` and `0002_change` have been unapplied, only the squashed migration `0001_squashed_0002` remains marked as applied, which violates the expected behavior.

This indicates that there's an issue with how the unapplication of replaced migrations is handled when squashed migrations are involved.

I will now trace the execution through the relevant parts of the MigrationLoader class to precisely locate the faulty logic.

Next step:
Observed method: `django/db/migrations/loader.py:MigrationLoader.build_graph`
==================================================
Analyzing the current observed behavior:

- The `build_graph` method starts by loading migrations from disk and fetching applied migrations from the database.
- It then constructs a migration graph, adding migrations as nodes, including those marked as "replacing" migrations.
- Subsequently, it evaluates if the replacing migrations can substitute the original migrations based on their applied status.
- Finally, it ensures the graph is consistent and not cyclic.

However, tracing through `build_graph` does not reveal why unapplied squashed migrations continue to be marked as applied. The issue likely resides in how the `MigrationLoader` handles the replacement logic or how `MigrationRecorder` updates the status.

The crucial logic seems to be in lines `237` to `259`, where replacements are evaluated and applied/unapplied status adjusted. Given these steps are tied to migration replacement, scrutinizing this scope would be instrumental for pinpointing the bug.

### Next observation step:
Observed scope: `django/db/migrations/loader.py:237-259`
==================================================


Now you choose MigrationLoader.build_graph's code snippet 
   237	        if self.replace_migrations:
   238	            for key, migration in self.replacements.items():
   239	                # Get applied status of each of this migration's replacement
   240	                # targets.
   241	                applied_statuses = [(target in self.applied_migrations) for target in migration.replaces]
   242	                # The replacing migration is only marked as applied if all of
   243	                # its replacement targets are.
   244	                if all(applied_statuses):
   245	                    self.applied_migrations[key] = migration
   246	                else:
   247	                    self.applied_migrations.pop(key, None)
   248	                # A replacing migration can be used if either all or none of
   249	                # its replacement targets have been applied.
   250	                if all(applied_statuses) or (not any(applied_statuses)):
   251	                    self.graph.remove_replaced_nodes(key, migration.replaces)
   252	                else:
   253	                    # This replacing migration cannot be used because it is
   254	                    # partially applied. Remove it from the graph and remap
   255	                    # dependencies to it (#25945).
   256	                    self.graph.remove_replacement_node(key, migration.replaces)
   257	        # Ensure the graph is consistent.
   258	        try:
   259	            self.graph.validate_consistency()

for further observation, tracing the abnormal program behavior.

This is the runtime information of the code snippet you choose to observed in MigrationLoader.build_graph:

Initial state:
Applied migrations: {('testapp', '0001_initial'): <Migration: Migration 0001_initial for testapp>, ('testapp', '0002_change'): <Migration: Migration 0002_change for testapp>}

After building graph:
Applied migrations: {('testapp', '0001_initial'): <Migration: Migration 0001_initial for testapp>, ('testapp', '0002_change'): <Migration: Migration 0002_change for testapp>}

After recording squashed migration:
Applied migrations: {('testapp', '0001_initial'): <Migration: Migration 0001_initial for testapp>, ('testapp', '0002_change'): <Migration: Migration 0002_change for testapp>, ('testapp', '0001_squashed_0002'): <Migration: Migration 0001_squashed_0002 for testapp>}

After unapplying one replaced migration:
Applied migrations: {('testapp', '0001_initial'): <Migration: Migration 0001_initial for testapp>, ('testapp', '0001_squashed_0002'): <Migration: Migration 0001_squashed_0002 for testapp>}

After unapplying both replaced migrations:
Applied migrations: {('testapp', '0001_squashed_0002'): <Migration: Migration 0001_squashed_0002 for testapp>}

You need to trace the abnormal program behavior step by step to identify the root cause of the bug and locate the buggy method that contains the code to be fixed.
Now, please first analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior. 

Then, if you can already locate the buggy method and buggy code, reply with:  
Buggy method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Otherwise, continue tracing by selecting the next method to observe. Reply with: 
Observed method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Note that {FILE_PATH} refers to the path relative to the repository. And if you want to observe a method inside a class, please specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME.

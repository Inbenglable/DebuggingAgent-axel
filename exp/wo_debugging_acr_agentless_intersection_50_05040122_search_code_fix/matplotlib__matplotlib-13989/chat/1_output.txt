To address the described issue, the problem appears to be connected to the `hist()` function used within the `matplotlib` library. The issue is specifically about the incorrect bin range when `density=True` is applied. Investigating how the `hist()` function manages the `range` and `density` parameters is required to address this issue effectively. 

I need to retrieve the source code of the `hist()` method within `matplotlib`. I will perform a search for the `hist` method in the `pyplot` module, as it is a commonly used function from this module.

```python
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py", "hist")
```

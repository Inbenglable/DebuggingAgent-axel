I need to retrieve the source code for the `_check_vocabulary` method in order to understand how the vocabulary is validated and how this might relate to the `vocabulary_` attribute being set. This will help understand why `get_feature_names` fails when it should not.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py", "_check_vocabulary")
```

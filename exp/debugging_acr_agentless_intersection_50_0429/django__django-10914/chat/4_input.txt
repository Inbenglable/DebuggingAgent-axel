You need to trace the abnormal program to resolve project issues and submit pull requests.
Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Set default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.
Description
	
Hello,
As far as I can see, the ​File Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.
What I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).
The tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.
I found mentions of this issue ​on GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.

This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
The issue observed in the test output concerns the discrepancy in file permissions for uploaded files when using different types of temporary storage. The key problem is that when a `TemporaryUploadedFile` is involved, it results in a file with permissions of `0o600`, whereas the desired permission is `0o644`. This typically stems from the behavior of the Python `tempfile` module, where temporary files receive restricted permissions for security reasons.

To address this issue, we should investigate where the `TemporaryUploadedFile` writes the file to storage and where the file permissions might be set or could be overridden. Based on the information provided, the error is likely associated with how Django's `FileSystemStorage` or possibly the `TemporaryUploadedFile` itself handles file saving.

Current analysis suggests tracing the saving behavior in the `FileSystemStorage.save` method since this is where the file handling operations occur. This method is responsible for managing the storage of files, and potentially where file permissions are applied or need to be adjusted.

Observed method: `django/core/files/storage.py:FileSystemStorage.save`
==================================================
The current issue relates to the inconsistent file permissions set for uploaded files when using different storage backends. The function `FileSystemStorage.save` calls the private method `_save`, which is responsible for handling the actual storage of files. The observed behavior indicates that the permissions for files saved using a `TemporaryUploadedFile` end up as `0o600`, likely due to the `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` method setting restrictive permissions.

The `FileSystemStorage.save` method has been traced, and the trace indicates it calls `_save`. The inconsistency in file permissions is likely being handled in or after this downstream call, as the discrepancy in expected permissions is not resolved by the end of the `save` method. The `_save` method is where the file is actually saved, so it is a good candidate for further inspection to resolve this issue.

To pinpoint the exact problem, let's examine the `_save` method next.

Observed scope: `django/core/files/storage.py:53-<end_of__save_method>` (assumption: you will need to find where `_save` is defined, this line number is assumed following `save` method)
==================================================
The issue at hand is the inconsistency in file permissions for uploaded files when handled as `TemporaryUploadedFile` by Django's `FileSystemStorage`. Currently, files are saved with restrictive permissions of `0o600`, due to the behavior of Python's `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile`, which is designed to set limited permissions on temporary files to enhance security.

### Current Findings:
1. **Inconsistent File Permissions**: The test confirms that files are being saved with permissions `0o600` when they are supposed to be saved with `0o644`.
   
2. **Location of Issue**: The issue likely originates in the handling of file permissions when written to the disk, specifically in how `FileSystemStorage` and its `_save` method work with temporary files.

3. **Traceback Observations**: The error traceback shows an `AssertionError` for permission mismatch and a `FileNotFoundError` likely due to a missing cleanup of temporary files.

Since `FileSystemStorage.save` delegates to `_save` which actually handles the file saving process, we need to delve deeper into `_save` to locate where file permissions are applied or modified.

### Next Steps:
To determine the exact spot and extent of the bug, we will investigate the `_save` method where the file saving logic resides. This method is crucial because it undertakes the task of writing files to the filesystem and can influence file permission handling.

Observed method: `django/core/files/storage.py:FileSystemStorage._save`
==================================================

You need to trace the abnormal program behavior step by step to identify the root cause of the bug and locate the buggy method that contains the code to be fixed.
Now, please first analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior. 

Then, if you can already locate the buggy method and buggy code, reply with:
Buggy method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Otherwise, continue tracing by telling me the code line scope that you want to deeper observe, we will show you the deeper downstream run-time information of the scope you select. Please reply with:
Observed scope: `{FILE_PATH}:{START_LOC}-{END_LOC}`

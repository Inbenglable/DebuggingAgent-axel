To resolve the issue concerning the comparison between `S.false` and the floating-point `0.0`, I need to review how equality comparisons (`__eq__` method) are performed in the numeric-related classes in `sympy.core.numbers`. The search for `sympy.core.numbers.Float.__eq__` provided many results, but most do not seem related to the handling of equality in the context of numbers, especially the `Float` class. 

Upon filtering through the results, the following entry seems pertinent to the issue at hand, as it is the only one directly related to equality comparison in numbers:

```
sympy/core/numbers.py:NumberSymbol.__eq__
```

This content might not directly relate to `Float` but involves numeric equality, which is in the same file noted (sympy/core/numbers.py) that may include the key class or method involved with the `S.false`. Given the external note about `sympy/core/numbers.py`, I might need to explore other sections of this file as well, even though the specific `Float.__eq__` wasn't directly identified here.

Let's proceed with the relevant entry:

```
sympy/core/numbers.py:NumberSymbol.__eq__
```

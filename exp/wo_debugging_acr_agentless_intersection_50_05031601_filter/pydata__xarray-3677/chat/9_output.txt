Let's review the patch and analyze the test outputs.

### Patch Analysis:

The patch modifies the `xarray/core/dataset.py` file to handle merging a `DataArray` with a `Dataset`. Specifically, it checks whether `other` is an instance of `DataArray` and, if so, converts it to a `Dataset` using `other.to_dataset()`. This adjustment is made before calling `dataset_merge_method()` in the `merge` function.

### Test Output Analysis:

**Original Output:**

The original output indicates that attempting to use `ds.merge(da)` results in an `AttributeError` because `DataArray` does not have an `items()` method. This confirms the issue as described: the method fails to perform the merge operation.

**Patched Output:**

The patched output shows no error message and successfully prints the expected dataset:

```
<xarray.Dataset>
Dimensions:  ()
Data variables:
    a        int64 0
    b        int64 1
```

This matches the expected output as shown in the example using `xr.merge([ds, da])`, indicating that the merge operation now works correctly and mirrors the behavior of the top-level `merge()` function.

### Conclusion:

The patch resolved the issue by correctly enabling the merge functionality between a `Dataset` and a `DataArray` using the `ds.merge()` method, resulting in accurate and expected output without errors.

Issue resolved: `True`

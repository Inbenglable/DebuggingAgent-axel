The goal is to resolve the deprecation warnings from NumPy regarding out-of-bound integer conversions in the `matplotlib/colors.py` file. The problem occurs in lines 730 to 732, which are part of a sequence responsible for adjusting the array `xa` based on certain conditions. 

Here, I need to adjust the code to handle the upcoming changes in NumPy's behavior regarding integer conversions.

I already have enough context about the block of code surrounding the critical lines, so I'm ready to generate a patch to resolve this issue.

Ready generation: `True`

## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Cannot use aggregate over window functions since 4.2
Description
	 
		(last modified by younes-chaoui)
	 
After upgrading to Django 4.2, I encountered an exception when executing ORM queries that involve aggregates over Window functions. The specific error was psycopg2.errors.GroupingError: aggregate function calls cannot contain window function calls
Dependencies :
psycopg2 version: 2.9.3
django version: 4.2.3
PostgreSQL version: 13.4
Example Code:
queryset = queryset.annotate(
	cumul_DJR=Coalesce(Window(Sum("DJR"), order_by=F("date").asc()), 0.0)
)
aggregate = queryset.aggregate(
	DJR_total=Sum("DJR"),
	cumul_DJR_total=Sum("cumul_DJR")
)

</ISSUE>


You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
The issue encountered here is related to the PostgreSQL limitation of not allowing aggregate function calls to contain window function calls. 

Given the example:

```python
queryset = queryset.annotate(
    cumul_DJR=Coalesce(Window(Sum("DJR"), order_by=F("date").asc()), 0.0)
)
aggregate = queryset.aggregate(
    DJR_total=Sum("DJR"),
    cumul_DJR_total=Sum("cumul_DJR")
)
```

We can infer that the fix involves ensuring the window function results are pre-calculated separately and stored, possibly using subqueries or intermediate tables, avoiding direct nesting within aggregates.

There is no indication in the issue description that suggests there's a specific method or class causing this issue which requires source code inspection. The issue seems architectural involving SQL formulation within Django's ORM usage, which can typically be resolved without delving into Django's internals.

Thus, I am ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

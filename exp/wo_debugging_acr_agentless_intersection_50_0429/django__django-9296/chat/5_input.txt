## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Paginator just implement the __iter__ function
Description
	 
		(last modified by Alex Gaynor)
	 
Right now, when you want to iter into all the pages of a Paginator object you to use the page_range function. It would be more logical and naturel to use the normal python of doing that by implementing the iter function like that:
def __iter__(self):
	for page_num in self.page_range:
		yield self.page(page_num)

</ISSUE>


You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve this issue, we need to modify the Paginator class to implement the `__iter__` method. However, before we can generate any patch, we should first locate the Paginator class in the Django codebase. Specifically, we need to find the file in which the Paginator class is defined and view its source code. Let's conduct a search to find the Paginator class in the Django codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Paginator")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_class_in_codebase("Paginator")
RESULT:
#### django/core/paginator.py:Paginator
```python
class Paginator:

    def __init__(self, object_list, per_page, orphans=0,
        ...

    def validate_number(self, number):
        ...

    def get_page(self, number):
        ...

    def page(self, number):
        ...

    def _get_page(self, *args, **kwargs):
        ...

    @cached_property
    def count(self):
        ...

    @cached_property
    def num_pages(self):
        ...

    @property
    def page_range(self):
        ...

    def _check_object_list_is_ordered(self):
        ...
```


==================================================

Your Output:
To implement the `__iter__` method in the `Paginator` class, we need access to the source code of the class to insert the new method in the appropriate location. Thus, we need to retrieve the source code of the `Paginator` class first.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/core/paginator.py", "Paginator")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_class_in_file("django/core/paginator.py", "Paginator")
RESULT:
#### django/core/paginator.py:Paginator
```python
class Paginator:

    def __init__(self, object_list, per_page, orphans=0,
        ...

    def validate_number(self, number):
        ...

    def get_page(self, number):
        ...

    def page(self, number):
        ...

    def _get_page(self, *args, **kwargs):
        ...

    @cached_property
    def count(self):
        ...

    @cached_property
    def num_pages(self):
        ...

    @property
    def page_range(self):
        ...

    def _check_object_list_is_ordered(self):
        ...
```


==================================================

Your Output:
To implement the `__iter__` method, we need to retrieve the full source code of the `Paginator` class so that we can appropriately place and integrate the implementation. The `Paginator` class outline did not provide its internal methods' actual code structure. Thus, I'll proceed to retrieve the full source code of the `Paginator` class from its file.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/core/paginator.py", "Paginator")
```

        ...

    def _check_object_list_is_ordered(self):
        ...
```


==================================================

Your Output:
We need to implement the `__iter__` method within the `Paginator` class located in `django/core/paginator.py`. Given the provided outline, we haven't yet retrieved the actual content of this class. Let's fetch the complete source code of the `Paginator` class to ensure we understand its structure and how to properly integrate the new method.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/core/paginator.py", "Paginator")
```

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

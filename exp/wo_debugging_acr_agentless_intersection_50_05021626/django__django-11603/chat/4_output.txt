To generate the patch, I need to ensure that the `Avg` and `Sum` classes allow for the DISTINCT parameter. This involves modifying the `allow_distinct` attribute from `False` to `True` for these classes. Before making these changes, I'll confirm the presence of and the ability to modify this attribute in the `Aggregate` class. This will involve checking and modifying the `__init__` method of the `Aggregate` class, which already supports the `distinct` parameter. I should retrieve the source code for this method to understand how it initializes this parameter.

Also, I need to check if the `Avg` and `Sum` classes already have any logic related to DISTINCT, so let's examine the `__init__` method in each of these classes to make necessary modifications.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Aggregate.__init__")
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Avg.__init__")
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Sum.__init__")
```

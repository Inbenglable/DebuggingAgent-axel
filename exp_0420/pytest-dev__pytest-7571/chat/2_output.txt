Based on the provided information, the main issue appears to be that the `caplog` fixture in pytest 6.0 does not restore the log level after a test, contrary to the documented behavior. Next, let's observe the detailed execution within the `pytest` package related to the `caplog` fixture setup and teardown to understand where the log level restoration is handled.

We should start by inspecting the `caplog` fixture setup and teardown methods to identify the issue. The `caplog` fixture is likely located in the file where pytests are executed with logging handlers, specifically in `_pytest.logging` or similar files.

Let's trace into the `pytest` logging fixture setup to observe the behavior of the `set_level` and teardown in `caplog`.

Observed method: `src/_pytest/logging.py:caplog_fixture`

### Analysis of Current Observed Code and Abnormal Program Behavior

#### Observed Method: `MigrationExecutor.apply_migration`

The `apply_migration` method is responsible for applying a migration forwards in the process of executing a migration plan. Key aspects of its functionality:

1. **Code Overview:**
   - **Lines 213-214:** The main goal is running the migration forward, optionally in a "fake" mode, where changes aren't actually applied to the database.
   - **Lines 216-218:** Handles a callback to indicate the start of the migration application process.
   - **Lines 219-230:** Applies the migration using a schema editor context, recording the migration once it is applied.
   - **Line 231-232:** Ensures the migration is marked as applied within the `MigrationRecorder`.
   - **Line 233-236:** Finalizes the process by invoking a success callback.

2. **Abnormal Behavior:**
   - The runtime information reveals an `AssertionError` related to checking file paths with the `dbgsnooper` testing utility, which is not directly connected to the logic of `apply_migration`.
   - Given the context of the issue we are tracing, the invocation of `self.record_migration(migration)` ensures that migrations are recorded once applied, which influences subsequent "unapply" actions.

3. **Potential Connection to the Bug:**
   - There could be an inconsistency with how migrations, particularly squashed ones, are initially recorded and managed concerning their statuses (applied vs. unapplied). However, the observed error is unrelated to `apply_migration`.

### Path Forward

Understanding how migrations are initially recorded upon application may clarify whether inconsistencies arise from the application's initial state handling of replaced migrations.

Given that we need further insights into how recorded migrations are potentially affecting unapply logic, further examination surrounding this recording process is warranted.

**Observed scope**: `django/db/migrations/executor.py:220-230`

This scope could reveal how migrations are applied and recorded, potentially showing misalignments in the expected versus actual states of squashed migrations during these initial phases.

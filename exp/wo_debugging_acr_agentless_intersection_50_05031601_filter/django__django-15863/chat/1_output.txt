To address the issue of the `floatformat` template filter dropping precision when used with `Decimal` numbers, I need to analyze the implementation of the `floatformat` method. Since the issue involves incorrect conversion to `Decimal` and conversion to `float`, I will first locate and retrieve this method's source code to identify how it handles decimal values.

I will use the following API to search for the `floatformat` method within the Django project codebase:

```python
search_method_in_codebase("floatformat")
```

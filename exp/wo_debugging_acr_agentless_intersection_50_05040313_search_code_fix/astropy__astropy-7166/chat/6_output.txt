To determine whether the issue is resolved, let's break down the components involved:

1. **Issue Description**: The `InheritDocstrings` metaclass does not work for properties because it checks with `inspect.isfunction`, which returns `False` for properties.

2. **Reproduce Test**: The test checks if the docstring of a method and a property in a derived class is correctly inherited from a base class. The failure of the test, indicated by an `AssertionError`, shows that the property docstring is not inherited.

3. **Original Output**: The original output indicates an `AssertionError` for the property docstring, confirming the issue that properties' docstrings were not being inherited.

4. **Patch Explanation**: The patch replaces the check from `inspect.isfunction` to also include `inspect.isdatadescriptor`, which correctly identifies properties, enabling the inheritance of their docstrings.

5. **Patched Output**: The patched output contains no errors, suggesting that the assertions in the reproduce test passed successfully and both method and property docstrings are now inherited correctly.

Based on this analysis, the absence of assertions or errors in the patched output implies that the patch fixes the issue. Property docstrings are now correctly inherited via the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass.

Issue resolved: `True`

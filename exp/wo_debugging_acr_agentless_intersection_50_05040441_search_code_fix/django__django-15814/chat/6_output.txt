To address the issue where `QuerySet.only()` used after `select_related()` crashes on proxy models, we'll need to modify the code in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` to ensure it handles proxy model cases correctly when determining what fields to select. Specifically, we'll change the line:

```python
opts = cur_model._meta
```

to:

```python
opts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta
```

This will make sure that `opts` refers to the `concrete_model` of the proxy model to properly consider its primary keys.

Here's the patch in the SEARCH/REPLACE format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/sql/query.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nopts = cur_model._meta\n=======\nopts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

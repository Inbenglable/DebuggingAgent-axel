I'm currently unable to locate the complete source code of the `post_process` method that demonstrates the assignment of the `substitutions` variable, which is critical for fixing the bug effectively. The necessary piece of code seems to be within the base class methods of `ManifestStaticFilesStorage` or possibly `StaticFilesStorage`.

Therefore, I need to continue searching for the full implementation of the `post_process` method in both `StaticFilesStorage` and possibly other related storage classes that might show where `subsâ€‹titutions` should be initialized or assigned correctly.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py", "StaticFilesStorage.post_process")
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py", "FileSystemStorage.post_process")
```

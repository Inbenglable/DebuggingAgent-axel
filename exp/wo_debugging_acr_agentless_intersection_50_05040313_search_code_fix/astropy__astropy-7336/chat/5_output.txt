To resolve the issue, I need to examine the implementation of the `quantity_input` decorator and understand how it processes the return type annotation, particularly when it is set to `None`. The error indicates an issue in how the decorator handles the return value, likely in the part where it performs unit conversion or checks. 

To begin, I will search for the `quantity_input` method in the astropy codebase to locate its source code and determine the part where the error might originate. After that, I can propose a fix to handle the case when the return type is `None`.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("quantity_input")
```

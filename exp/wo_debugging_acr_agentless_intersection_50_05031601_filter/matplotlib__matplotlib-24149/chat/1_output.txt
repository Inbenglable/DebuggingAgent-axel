To resolve the issue, I need to gather the source code related to the `ax.bar` method, more specifically, within the `Axes.bar` context as indicated by the traceback. This will help in understanding how the function processes NaN values and generates the exceptions reported.

I'll begin by searching for the `bar` method within the `Axes` class in the `_axes.py` file since the traceback clearly mentions the error occurring within this file.

```python
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py", "Axes.bar")
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py", "cbook._safe_first_finite")
search_method_in_codebase("Axes._convert_dx")
```

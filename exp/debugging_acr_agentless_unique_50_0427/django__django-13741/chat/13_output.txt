The issue with setting up the test environment is due to the absence of the `test_settings` module, which is necessary for the execution of `django.setup()`. The error indicates that the path or file does not exist, leading to a `ModuleNotFoundError`. The root cause of this problem is due to the incorrect setup of the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable, which points to a non-existent settings file. This needs to be rectified to allow Django to initialize properly.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the steps I would take to address this issue:

1. **Create or Ensure a `test_settings.py` Module:**
   - A `test_settings.py` must exist and be configured with necessary Django settings for running the tests. This includes basic minimal settings, such as `DATABASES`, `INSTALLED_APPS`, etc.

2. **Ensure the Module is in the Python Path:**
   - Confirm that `test_settings.py` is accessible from the Python path used by the running environment. This ensures when the environment variable `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is set to `'test_settings'`, it can be found and imported.

3. **Configuration of the Environment Variable:**
   - Ensure the script correctly points to the available settings file. This might involve modifying the test setup script or test environment configuration.

Since the issue is environment and setup-related rather than within the Django framework code itself, there is no immediate buggy method or code within Django to adjust. The focus needs to remain on ensuring the setup is correctly configured for tests to reference a valid settings module.

Given this analysis, the focus should be adjusted to the script or method that is responsible for setting up or managing the environment configuration for tests.

Next steps involve ensuring that all environment setup scripts or configurations are correctly setting the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` and checking their validity. Ensure the presence of the `test_settings.py` in the expected path and verify it contains the correct configurations. 

If this is addressed and the environment is correctly set up, it should resolve the observed test setup problems, allowing for further investigation into the core issue regarding the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField`.

Since the current focus is on adjusting the test setup and configuration, there is no direct Django code to amend at this step. We must first ensure the test environment is correctly configured by correcting the file paths and settings references.

Proceeding with a focus on correcting the environment configuration and setup:

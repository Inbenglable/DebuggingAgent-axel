I have obtained the source code for both the `ModelChoiceField` class and its `to_python` method, which is responsible for handling validation errors. The `default_error_messages` for `ModelChoiceField` does not currently include the invalid choice value, unlike `ModelMultipleChoiceField`. I am ready to modify the error message to include the invalid choice value.

Ready generation: `True`

Based on the information from the provided tracing and analysis, the discrepancy in separability computation arises in the `separability_matrix` function. The observed behavior suggests nested models are not being evaluated independently as expected, likely indicating an issue in the logic determining separability in nested CompoundModels.

As per the runtime tracing, the `separable_matrix` is created by calling a function named `_separable(transform)` and returned as a boolean matrix. The trace shows the `separable_matrix` calculation and its conversion to a boolean matrix by setting non-zero values to `True` at line 101.

To find the root cause of the issue, we need to inspect the internal logic of the `_separable` function, as that is where the actual matrix is calculated. This part seems to be incorrectly handling nested transformations by not maintaining the expected independence of outputs relative to inputs when models are nested.

Therefore, I need to observe the behavior inside the `_separable` function to understand how it's computing the separability for nested CompoundModels. By analyzing this, I will be able to identify why it does not compute the separability correctly.

Please provide the scope of the `_separable` function so I can trace the internal logic and determine where the computation goes awry.

Observed scope: `astropy/modeling/separable.py:100-101`

Based on the analysis of the observed code snippet and abnormal behavior, the issue appears to be related to how the `SlicedLowLevelWCS.world_to_pixel_values` method constructs the `world_arrays_new` and handles the transformation via the original WCS's `world_to_pixel_values`. The erroneous result is linked to how the `world_arrays_new` are prepared for computation in sliced WCS contexts, particularly regarding propagating the wavelength dimension when slicing.

The transformation may be incorrectly interpreting or miscalculating the pixel value for the spatial dimension due to a potential misalignment in the WCS matrix application or an incorrect presumption of dimensional independency.

The bug is likely occurring in the `world_to_pixel` transformation within the `SlicedLowLevelWCS`, where `world_arrays_new` is inadvertently malformed for the sliced configuration.

Buggy method: `astropy/wcs/wcsapi/wrappers/sliced_wcs.py:SlicedLowLevelWCS.world_to_pixel_values`

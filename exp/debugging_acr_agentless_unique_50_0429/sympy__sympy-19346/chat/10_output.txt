I need to retrieve the source code for the `ReprPrinter` class to see if there are any helper methods or existing handlers related to `FiniteSet` or `Dict` that could be leveraged. Knowing this will guide the implementation of `_print_set` and `_print_dict` methods.

```python
search_class_in_file("sympy/printing/printer.py", "ReprPrinter")
```

To address the issue, I need to modify the implementation in the file `django/db/models/sql/query.py` around line 745. Specifically, the issue can be resolved by changing `opts = cur_model._meta` to `opts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta`.

Before I proceed, I should gather the source code context around this change to ensure the modification is correctly integrated into the existing logic. Since I already have some surrounding code, I should retrieve more context around the target line if needed.

Let's proceed to generate the patch because replacing `opts = cur_model._meta` with `opts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta` seems straightforward given the information and context already received.

Ready generation: `True`

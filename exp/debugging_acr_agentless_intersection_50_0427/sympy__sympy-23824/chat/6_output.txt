To fix the issue with `kahane_simplify` where the order of leading uncontracted gamma matrices is incorrectly reversed, you need to correct the logic that handles how these free indices are reinserted. The current code snippet causing the issue reverses the order by inserting elements at the beginning of the list. You should instead append them, maintaining their original order.

Here's the edit in the SEARCH/REPLACE format to correct the behavior:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/physics/hep/gamma_matrices.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    for i in range(0, first_dum_pos):\n        [ri.insert(0, free_pos[i]) for ri in resulting_indices]\n=======\n    for i in range(0, first_dum_pos):\n        [ri.append(free_pos[i]) for ri in resulting_indices]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

To address the issue at hand, I need to generate a patch for the `add_fields` method inside the `django.forms.formsets` file. The suggested fix involves adding a condition to check if the `index` is not `None`. In order to proceed with generating this patch, I first need to retrieve the source code for the `add_fields` method to fully understand its context and implement the necessary changes.

Let's retrieve the source code for the `add_fields` method:

```python
search_method_in_file("django/forms/formsets.py", "add_fields")
```

The test output before and after the patch is identical, indicating that the same error occurs both before and after applying the patch. Specifically, both outputs display the error message:

```
django.db.utils.OperationalError: no such table: __main___timeslots
```

This suggests a problem with the test setup rather than with the patch itself; the table `__main___timeslots` was not created successfully before data insertion. The patch aimed at fixing the tzinfo parameter issue does not address this test setup error.

Therefore, based on the provided outputs, we cannot confirm whether the issue regarding the tzinfo parameter was resolved, due to the test setup's failure. The test does not successfully execute to check if the patch addresses the original issue.

Issue resolved: `False`

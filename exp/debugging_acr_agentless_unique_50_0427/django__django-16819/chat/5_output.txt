Based on the provided implementation of the `check_excessive_operations` function, I have gathered enough information to generate a patch. The function detects redundant `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex` operations but currently only raises an AssertionError when these are found. Instead of merely detecting these redundant operations, the function should be modified to remove them from the list.

Therefore, I can now proceed to generate the patch to resolve the issue.

Ready generation: `True`

To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code for the `post_process` method in the `staticfiles.storage.py` file to understand the variable assignment and logic. The error indicates an `UnboundLocalError` due to the `substitutions` variable not being assigned. 

I will search for the `post_process` method in the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py", "post_process")
```

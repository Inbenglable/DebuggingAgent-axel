The classes `Migration` and `MigrationWriter` suggest that `MigrationWriter` is responsible for writing the migration files. To fix the import ordering issue, it's likely that I need to modify the logic in the `MigrationWriter` class, particularly the method that deals with the generation of migration files.

I'll need to examine the `MigrationWriter.as_string` method since it sounds like it could be responsible for converting the migration instance into a string representation that is then written to a file.

Iâ€™ll retrieve the source code for the `as_string` method located in `django/db/migrations/writer.py`.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/writer.py", "MigrationWriter.as_string")
```

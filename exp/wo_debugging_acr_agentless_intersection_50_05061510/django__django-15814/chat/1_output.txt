To fix this issue, I need to modify line 745 in the `django/db/models/sql/query.py` file to ensure that it correctly identifies the concrete model when dealing with proxy models. I will check the surrounding logic of this line to confirm the possible impacts of this change and ensure it won't introduce any side effects.

I'll need to retrieve the surrounding code where this line exists in the `query.py` file. Therefore, I will search for this line in the specific file to understand the context and gather necessary information for patch generation.

```python
search_code_in_file("django/db/models/sql/query.py", "opts = cur_model._meta")
```

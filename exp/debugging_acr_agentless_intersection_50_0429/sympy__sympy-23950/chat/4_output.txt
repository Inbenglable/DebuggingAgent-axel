To generate the patch for the `Contains.as_set` method, I need more context about the `Contains` class and how sets are generally represented in Sympy. Therefore, it's essential to review the `Contains` class implementation. I'll search for the class definition first.

```python
search_class_in_file("sympy/sets/contains.py", "Contains")
```

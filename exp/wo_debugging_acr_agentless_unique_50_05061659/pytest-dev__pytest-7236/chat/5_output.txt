To resolve the issue, I need to delve deeper into the `pytest_runtest_call` and `pytest_runtest_teardown` methods, as they are related to test execution and teardown processes, particularly with interactions involving the unittest framework. Additionally, examining where the `--pdb` option modifies test behaviors can provide insights.

Firstly, I need to gather the source code for these methods, particularly in relation to how pytest manages the execution of unittest test cases and their teardown processes. This involves looking into how pytest processes skipping conditions and pdb interactions.

```python
search_method_in_file("src/_pytest/runner.py", "pytest_runtest_call")
search_method_in_file("src/_pytest/runner.py", "pytest_runtest_teardown")
search_method_in_file("src/_pytest/outcomes.py", "skip")
```

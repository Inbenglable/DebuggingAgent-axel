To resolve the issue, I need to inspect the implementation of the `dataset_merge_method` function that is used within the `Dataset.merge` method. The error indicates that it tries to access the `items()` method on a `DataArray` object, which is the root cause of the failure when merging a `Dataset` and a `DataArray`. I will locate and retrieve the source code for the `dataset_merge_method` function.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("dataset_merge_method")
```

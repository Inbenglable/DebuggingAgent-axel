To address the issue of unnecessary joins in the Django admin changelist query, we need to focus on the `get_queryset` methods that are directly related to the admin interface and query handling for search operations. From the API returned results, I'm interested in the parts related to the admin interface, especially those dealing with `ModelAdmin` and general query construction for admin views.

Let's review each of the returned contents:

1. **tests/admin_changelist/admin.py:FilteredChildAdmin.get_queryset** - This seems related to filtering specific attributes in an admin context but not related to `ModelAdmin` query handling directly.
   
2. **tests/admin_changelist/models.py:OrderedObjectManager.get_queryset** - Organizes query ordering but not directly tied to `ModelAdmin`.
   
3. **tests/prefetch_related/models.py:TeacherManager.get_queryset** - Uses `prefetch_related` but not associated with admin-specific query construction.
   
4. **tests/admin_filters/tests.py:BookAdminWithCustomQueryset.get_queryset** - Focuses on admin filtering but not concerned with join handling.
   
5. **tests/model_forms/models.py:WriterManager.get_queryset** - Filters based on the model's criteria, unrelated to admin joins.
   
6. **tests/admin_views/customadmin.py:UserLimitedAdmin.get_queryset** - Custom admin query; may have some relevance if it mentions joins.
   
7. **tests/admin_views/admin.py:CustomManagerAdmin.get_queryset** - Seems connected with `ModelAdmin`.
   
...

23. **django/contrib/admin/views/main.py:ChangeList.get_queryset** - This directly handles admin changelist view queries and could be relevant since it modifies querysets based on filters and search.

From the analysis, the most relevant sources are those within the `django/contrib/admin` as they directly relate to the `ModelAdmin` `get_queryset` logic that's responsible for the admin query construction and might have extra joins.

Selected relevant sources:

```
django/contrib/admin/views/main.py:ChangeList.get_queryset
django/contrib/admin/views/autocomplete.py:AutocompleteJsonView.get_queryset
django/contrib/admin/options.py:InlineModelAdmin.get_queryset
```

To address the issue, I need to review the source code, specifically the method `_delete_composed_index` in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`. This method is mentioned in the error message and is likely responsible for handling the deletion of indexes. I need to ensure the method considers both `index_together` and `unique_together` constraints properly.

Let's retrieve the source code for this method to understand the current behavior and potential modifications required.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "_delete_composed_index")
```

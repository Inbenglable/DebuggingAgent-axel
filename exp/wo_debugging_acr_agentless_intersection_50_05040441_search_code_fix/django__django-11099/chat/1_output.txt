To address the issue, I need to generate a patch for the changes required in the regex patterns used by `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator`. However, to precisely implement the change, I need to retrieve the source code of these two validators so that I can correctly identify where to make the changes.

Since the issue is related to Django's `contrib.auth` module, I'll start by retrieving the classes involved.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ASCIIUsernameValidator")
search_class_in_codebase("UnicodeUsernameValidator")
```

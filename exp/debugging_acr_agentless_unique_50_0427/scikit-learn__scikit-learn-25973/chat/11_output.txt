Upon reviewing the patch and analyzing the test output before and after the application, the following observations can be made:

1. **Patch Details**: The patch attempts to resolve the issue by converting the `cv` argument in the `_get_best_new_feature_score` method from an iterable (possibly a generator) into a list. This is intended to ensure that the iterable, which represents the cross-validation splits, does not get exhausted when used multiple times.

2. **Original Output**: The original output indicates an `IndexError`, stemming from accessing an index from an empty list-like object. This is likely due to the exhaustion of the generator, which results in the `cross_val_score` function receiving an empty sequence to operate upon.

3. **Patched Output**: After applying the patch, the output remains identical to the original output. The same `IndexError` appears at the same point in the execution flow. This indicates that the issue persists despite the applied changes.

Given these observations, the patch did not resolve the issue. The error persists, and the test continues to fail in the same manner as before.

Issue resolved: `False`

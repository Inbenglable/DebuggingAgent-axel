Based on the inspection of the `Query` class and the problem description, the suggested solution is to modify the way Django retrieves metadata for models by accessing the concrete model's metadata when dealing with proxy models. Specifically, it involves changing how `opts` is assigned within the relevant method. Below are the changes needed in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` file:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/sql/query.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nopts = cur_model._meta\n=======\nopts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
``` 

This patch replaces the assignment of `opts` from using `cur_model._meta` to `cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta`, which should resolve the bug related to crashing when using `QuerySet.only()` after `select_related()` with proxy models in Django.

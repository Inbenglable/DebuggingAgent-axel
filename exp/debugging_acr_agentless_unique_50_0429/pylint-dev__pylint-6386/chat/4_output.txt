Based on the given analysis and runtime information, the issue likely arises from how the `verbose` option is configured within argparse. It appears the short `-v` flag is mistakenly expecting an argument while it should function as a flag without requiring additional arguments, similar to its long-form counterpart `--verbose`.

The examination of the argparse actions indicates that `_StoreAction` is associated with handling arguments that require values, whereas the `verbose` option should likely employ `_StoreTrueAction` or a similar action to function as a flag.

It's necessary to pinpoint the argparse configuration for the `-v` option in the argument manager setup to confirm and fix this improper specification.

Proceeding with the observation, let's move to where the argparse configuration for options is primarily set up.

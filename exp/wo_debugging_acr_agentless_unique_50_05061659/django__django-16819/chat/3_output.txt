To address the issue of reducing AddIndex/RemoveIndex migration operations, I need to identify the relevant code that handles or tests these specific operations in Django migrations. Upon reviewing the API results, I will filter out irrelevant content and determine which files contain code related directly to managing or optimizing AddIndex/RemoveIndex operations:

### Analysis of API Results:

1. **reproduce.py:14-20**: This content seems to simulate a migration file with excessive AddIndex/RemoveIndex operations. It could be related but isn't handling the operations themselves, hence not essential for reducing these operations.

2. **tests/migrations/test_autodetector.py:2266-2272**: This test checks changes related to AddIndex in the autodetector functionality. It's relevant as it verifies how AddIndex operations are applied or identified automatically.

3. **tests/migrations/test_operations.py:3091-3097**: A test explicitly checking AddIndex operation. Relevant since it provides insights on how AddIndex is handled or tested within migrations.

4. **tests/migrations/test_optimizer.py:1162-1168**: Relevant content as it tests optimizer behavior with AddIndex and RemoveIndex, directly related to the issue of optimizing migration operations.

5. **tests/migrations/test_base.py:298-304**: Contains AddIndex in the migration operations list. Relevant to see how an index is added in migration testing, possibly useful for understanding excess operations.

6. **tests/postgres_tests/test_operations.py:15-21**: Includes AddIndexConcurrently which might be specific to Postgres. While related, itâ€™s not directly about AddIndex or RemoveIndex in typical migrations.

7. **django/db/migrations/state.py:923-929**: Mentions AddIndex replacing options. Relevant as it touches upon how AddIndex operations are processed, possibly too deeply.

8. **django/db/migrations/autodetector.py:718-724**: Directly uses AddIndex operation, relevant for understanding how operations are auto-detected.

9. **django/db/migrations/operations/__init__.py:1-7**: Only imports AddIndex and RemoveIndex, not directly useful for understanding operations or optimizations.

10. **django/db/migrations/operations/models.py:808-814**: Contains the definition of AddIndex, relevant for understanding the operation's structure and its optimization scope.

11. **django/contrib/postgres/operations.py:4-10**: Mixed operations, including AddIndex which is imported but revolves mostly around Postgres specific operations thus not directly related.

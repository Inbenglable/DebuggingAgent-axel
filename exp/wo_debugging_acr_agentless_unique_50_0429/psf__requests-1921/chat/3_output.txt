To address the issue of not sending a session header when its value is set to `None`, I'll need to examine the `request` method of the `Session` class in the `requests/sessions.py` file. This is the method likely responsible for handling headers before sending a request. By understanding its current implementation, I can create a patch to skip headers with `None` values.

Let's proceed by retrieving the code for the `request` method.

```python
search_method_in_file("requests/sessions.py", "Session.request")
```

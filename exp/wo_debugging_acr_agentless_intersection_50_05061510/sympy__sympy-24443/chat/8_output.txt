To address the issue in the `_image` function within `_check_homomorphism`, we need to ensure that the identification of a generator or its inverse in permutation groups works correctly. This means simplifying or adjusting the `if isinstance(domain, PermutationGroup)` block to handle inverted generators properly. Here's the patch that achieves this:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                if isinstance(domain, PermutationGroup) and r[i] in gens:\n=======\n                s = r[i]\n                if isinstance(domain, PermutationGroup):\n                    if r[i] in gens:\n                        s = domain.generators[gens.index(r[i])]\n                    elif r[i]**-1 in gens:\n                        s = domain.generators[gens.index(r[i]**-1)]**-1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

Explanation:
- Simplify the logic to detect both a generator or its inverse correctly when the `domain` is a `PermutationGroup`.
- Removed direct reliance on `gens` and added a condition to handle the inverse of generators explicitly, ensuring the `_image` function interprets both correctly.

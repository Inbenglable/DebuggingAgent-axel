To resolve the issue with the `_cstack` function in `astropy/modeling/separable.py`, we'll adjust the logic to ensure separation between nested compound models is preserved correctly. Here's the patch to fix the problem:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### astropy/modeling/separable.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        cleft[: left.shape[0], : left.shape[1]] = left\n=======\n        cleft[: left.shape[0], : left.shape[1]] = 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### astropy/modeling/separable.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = 1\n=======\n        cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = right\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation:
- **First Edit**: In the `cleft` array assignment, replace the existing assignment of `left` to ensure the top part reflects correct separability properties for the nested models.
- **Second Edit**: For `cright`, ensure the assignment uses the actual `right` matrix for consistent separability, fixing the improper zero-fill and misrepresentation, which incorrectly influences independence evaluation.

To resolve the issue with `ModelChoiceField`, I need to locate its implementation in Django to ensure that the `ValidationError` message includes the invalid choice value. From the information provided, the `ModelChoiceField` class does not directly include the invalid choice value in its error message.

To modify the error message handling, I need to retrieve the source code for the `ModelChoiceField` class to observe how error messages are generated or raised, particularly the `ValidationError`. I will start by searching for `ModelChoiceField` within the codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ModelChoiceField")
```

To resolve the issue, we will make the proposed change to the `django/db/models/sql/query.py` file as suggested. The problem appears to be related to how the QuerySet handles proxy models when using `select_related` and `only`. The proposed solution involves modifying the way the model options (`opts`) are determined by using the `concrete_model`'s meta options.

Let's create the patch:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/sql/query.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                opts = cur_model._meta\n=======\n                opts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch changes the line `opts = cur_model._meta` to `opts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta`, which should address the issue without disrupting the original functionality of the code.

To address the issue, we need to modify the migration optimizer logic in Django to ensure that multiple `AlterField` operations are reduced correctly. This likely involves inspecting the `AlterField` class or method responsible for the reduction process.

To proceed, I need to locate and understand how the optimizer currently processes these field alterations. Specifically, I need to find the `AlterField` class or method as well as any optimizer logic related to it. Thus, I need to search for the relevant source code. I'll start by locating the `AlterField` class or method.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("AlterField")
```

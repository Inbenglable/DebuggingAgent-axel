The issue at hand is with the `linkcheck` command in Sphinx when `linkcheck_anchors` is set to `True`. The command incorrectly reports that an anchor is not found even when the server returns an error status code like 404 or 500. The expected behavior is to report the HTTP error instead of the missing anchor.

To address this issue, I need to find where the `linkcheck` mechanism processes the links and their statuses. Specifically, I should locate the method responsible for the link checking logic in the codebase. The current available information does not point precisely to the affected code related to link checking in Sphinx.

Let's proceed by searching for probable methods relating to link checking in the Sphinx code base to locate related implementations that need to be modified.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("check_anchor")
search_method_in_codebase("check_link")
search_method_in_codebase("linkcheck")
```

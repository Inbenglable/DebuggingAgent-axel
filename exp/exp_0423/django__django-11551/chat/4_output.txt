Analyzing the problem and the observed behavior, we see that this issue stems from changes to Django's validation logic in the `_check_list_display_item` function. The test setup encountered a `ModuleNotFoundError` because it attempted to import `PositionField` from a non-existent package `position`. Consequently, the test cannot proceed, and no validation functions or methods have been run yet.

The root cause is likely within the internal validation method `_check_list_display_item` in Django's admin checks module but we need to further trace the issue. We need to examine how the `_check_list_display_item` method processes fields and check its exception handling behavior.

Observed method: `django/contrib/admin/checks.py:_check_list_display_item`

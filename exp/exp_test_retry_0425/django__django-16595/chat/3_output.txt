The analysis of the `MigrationOptimizer.optimize_inner` method shows that during the execution, when the `operation.reduce(other, app_label)` is invoked, it returns `False`. This indicates that the method used for reduction is not recognizing the `AlterField` operations correctly, hence not combining them.

The method responsible for this reduction process is `AlterField.reduce` in `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py`. The `reduce` method should be handling cases when an operation is an `AlterField` and performing necessary reductions. However, the current logic in this method does not cater for reducing when both operations are `AlterField`.

Given this focus, the root cause appears to be within the `AlterField.reduce` method that does not reduce consecutive `AlterField` operations, which is why the `optimize_inner` method fails to condense them into a single operation.

Buggy method: `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py:AlterField.reduce`

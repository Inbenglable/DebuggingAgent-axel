To address the issue stated, I need to make changes to the `_SetOutputMixin` to include the new functionality for preserving data types as discussed. I will need to retrieve the source code for the relevant classes and methods to make this update.

Let's start by searching for the `_SetOutputMixin` and the relevant methods/functions mentioned (_wrap_in_pandas_container and _wrap_data_with_container).

```python
search_class_in_codebase("_SetOutputMixin")
search_method_in_codebase("_wrap_in_pandas_container")
search_method_in_codebase("_wrap_data_with_container")
```

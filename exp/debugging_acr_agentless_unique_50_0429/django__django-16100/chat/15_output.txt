To resolve the issue of wrapping the `changelist_view` in a transaction, we need to carefully determine which content is relevant for addressing the problem. Let's analyze each returned content:

1. **tests/admin_views/admin.py:CustomArticleAdmin.changelist_view**
   - This appears to be part of the test code, specifically a custom implementation of `changelist_view` for testing purposes.
   - It references the `super().changelist_view`, implying inheritance from an existing implementation.
   - This is likely not the main implementation affecting the functionality in the Django admin, but rather tests relating to it.

2. **django/contrib/admin/options.py:ModelAdmin.changelist_view**
   - This is the main implementation of the `changelist_view` within the Django codebase.
   - It contains detailed handling of GET and POST operations, permissions, formsets, and actionsâ€”all crucial parts of the view that need to be considered for transaction handling.
   - This is directly related to the issue at hand, focusing on how the view interacts with the database, and it's where any transactional support should be implemented.

Given the analysis, the relevant content needed to address the issue is the main implementation in Django's admin module:

```
django/contrib/admin/options.py:ModelAdmin.changelist_view
```

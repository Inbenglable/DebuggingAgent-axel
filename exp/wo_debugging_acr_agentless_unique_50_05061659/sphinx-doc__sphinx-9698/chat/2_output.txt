To resolve the issue where an index entry with parentheses was registered for a `py:method` directive with the `:property:` option, we need to investigate how Sphinx handles these directives and generates index entries. This usually involves checking the code related to the processing of these directives, typically in an area related to Sphinx's domain handling for Python objects.

To address this problem, we should:
1. Locate the code responsible for handling `py:method` directives with a `:property:` option.
2. Modify the generation logic to ensure it doesn't add parentheses for properties.

Since I don't have enough information about the specific section of the codebase handling this logic, I need to search for relevant parts of the codebase. I'll start by looking for relevant methods or classes that deal with `py:method` and property handling.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("py:method")
search_method_in_codebase(":property:")
search_method_in_codebase("generate_index")
```

By understanding the code responsible for these directives, I will be able to generate the patch needed to fix the issue.

ModelChoiceField does not provide value of invalid choice when raising ValidationError
Description
	 
		(last modified by Aaron Wiegel)
	 
Compared with ChoiceField and others, ModelChoiceField does not show the value of the invalid choice when raising a validation error. Passing in parameters with the invalid value and modifying the default error message for the code invalid_choice should fix this.
From source code:
class ModelMultipleChoiceField(ModelChoiceField):
	"""A MultipleChoiceField whose choices are a model QuerySet."""
	widget = SelectMultiple
	hidden_widget = MultipleHiddenInput
	default_error_messages = {
		'invalid_list': _('Enter a list of values.'),
		'invalid_choice': _('Select a valid choice. %(value)s is not one of the'
							' available choices.'),
		'invalid_pk_value': _('“%(pk)s” is not a valid value.')
	}
	...
class ModelChoiceField(ChoiceField):
	"""A ChoiceField whose choices are a model QuerySet."""
	# This class is a subclass of ChoiceField for purity, but it doesn't
	# actually use any of ChoiceField's implementation.
	default_error_messages = {
		'invalid_choice': _('Select a valid choice. That choice is not one of'
							' the available choices.'),
	}
	...

</ISSUE>


A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
The output indicated an error related to the Django settings module not being found, specifically the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'reproducer'`. This implies that the environment setup for running the test was incorrect or incomplete, making it unable to locate the necessary settings for Django to initialize properly.

### Abnormal Behavior Analysis:

1. **Environment Setup Missing:** The test script attempts to set up Django using the `'reproducer.settings'`, which is a required component for Django's initialization. The absence of this module indicates that the settings configuration has not been defined or located within the project directory or path.

2. **Settings Configuration:** Normally, the Django settings module should be present and correctly specified in the environment setup. Without this, the `django.setup()` call cannot proceed as it requires knowing the configuration parameters (like database settings, installed apps, middleware, etc.)

### Next Steps:

To locate the buggy method or code:
- Ensure that the setup script correctly locates and configures the settings which are mandatory for Django's initialization.
- Review the setup process to identify how the settings are handled and why the `ModuleNotFoundError` is occurring.

Given the setup issues, I will next observe the code related to loading settings and initializing Django, starting with the function that attempts to import the settings module:

Observed method: `django/conf/__init__.py:LazySettings._setup`
==================================================
### Analysis of the Current Observed Code and Abnormal Behavior

#### Code Analysis
The `LazySettings._setup` method is responsible for loading the settings module specified by the environment variable `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`. The method performs the following steps:
1. Retrieves the value of the environment variable `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`. (Line 45)
2. Checks if the environment variable is set. If not, it raises an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception. (Lines 46-52)
3. Loads the settings using the `Settings` class if the module name is available. (Line 54)

#### Abnormal Behavior
The error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'reproducer'` indicates that the Python interpreter attempted to import a module named `reproducer`, but it wasn't found. This error occurs because the `reproducer.settings` module is specified in the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable, but it doesn't exist in the system's Python path.

### Next Steps
Since the current observed code indicates that there is an issue with locating the settings module, we need to trace the steps leading to how the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable is set and used. The error originates from:

- **Line 54**: In the `LazySettings._setup` method, when attempting to create a `Settings` object with the module name `reproducer.settings`.

To further investigate, we need to delve into how the `Settings` class imports modules and trace the import process to better understand why the module is missing. Thus, the next step would be to observe deeper into the `Settings` class initialization.

### Next Trace
I will observe the `Settings` class initialization to understand how the import process attempts to import a possibly non-existent module.

#### Observed Scope
Observed scope: `django/conf/__init__.py:129-141`
==================================================
To address the issue and the `ModuleNotFoundError`, it is crucial to consider the absence of a Django settings module in the current setup. Before directly identifying a buggy method, resolving the setup misconfiguration will provide a clear pathway.

### Analysis of Observed Code and Current Issue

#### Code Analysis:
- The source of the error derives from the `importlib.import_module(self.SETTINGS_MODULE)` call on line 141 within the `Settings.__init__` method of `django/conf/__init__.py`.
- This line attempts to import the specified settings module indicated by the environment variable `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`, which is incorrectly set to `'reproducer.settings'`.

#### Abnormal Behavior:
- The test cannot proceed as intended due to the module `reproducer.settings` not being found, leading to the `ModuleNotFoundError`.
- This results from a missing or misconfigured settings file or import path, which halts the Django setup process.

### Next Steps:
To resolve the testing setup, we must ensure the environment is correctly configured with available paths and settings.

1. **Configuration Check**:
   - Verify whether a Django settings module exists and whether its path is correctly set within the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable.
   - Use a real or mock settings module within Django to ensure it is within Python's import path.

2. **Update the Test**:
   - Modify the test script to accurately reflect a realizable settings module, thereby preventing the `ModuleNotFoundError`.

Once the configuration correction is made and the test environment can prosper, continue by addressing the original issue about `ModelChoiceField` not yielding a value of invalid choice within its error message.

Following this configuration assessment, the actual focus on tracing and remedying the validation error can proceed.

By doing this, it ensures the tests can be executed properly, allowing one to observe and trace further into Django's forms and fields mechanisms to address the core matter you wanted originally to handle.

### Moving Forward:
Update the test environment configuration and ensure the presence of actual settings for Django. After configuration correction, if necessary, re-engage with locating the related form validation methods.

Given the current information, the test and configuration errors need addressing before continuing function tracing:

```python
New Correct Path: Set `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` to a valid settings module to continue test execution.
```

Once rectified, should the validation error still occur again, revisit observation:

Observed method: `django/forms/models.py:ModelChoiceField.__init__`
==================================================
Analyzing the observed code and abnormal behavior:

### Analysis of `ModelChoiceField.__init__`:

#### Code Description:
- The `ModelChoiceField` class extends `ChoiceField`, allowing the choices to be derived from a Django QuerySet.
- Its constructor essentially calls the `Field` base class's constructor (`Field.__init__`) and sets additional properties like `queryset`, `limit_choices_to`, and `to_field_name`.

#### Observed Behavior:
- The script execution is halted due to a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module 'reproducer'. This issue arises before any interaction with the `ModelChoiceField` initialization would occur in the given test setup.

### Abnormal Program Behavior:
- The central problem here doesn't seem to lie in the `ModelChoiceField` implementation itself but rather in the configuration of the Django environment required for running the test.
- The test setup fails because the specified Django settings module, `reproducer.settings`, is not found, preventing any further execution of the script and handling within `ModelChoiceField`.

### Next Steps:
Given the information, the root cause of failure isn't within the observed method but relates to test configuration. Thus, configuring the environment with an actual settings module becomes the first priority to even begin tracing the original issue related to the ValidationError output.

To proceed, resolving this configuration will allow the test case to be executed and help identify potential issues within `ModelChoiceField`. Therefore, the setup needs correction.

Thus, the course of action would first be fixing this setup issue, after which re-evaluation might direct toward touching the `ModelChoiceField`. Once the test environment is correct, if the initial issue was about error messaging, it would usually involve handling around validation methods.

To continue identifying internal behaviors accurately impacting `ModelChoiceField`, setup resolution is mandatory. Consequently, if required, revisit the class or validation methods post-configuration for further accuracy.

No buggy method within the current observations since script execution hasn't reached fields/validations. The primary course is to:

### Resolving Environment Setup
Ensure `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` points to an actual settings module and re-run test.

Should further exploration still prove required:
```python
Resolve configuration. Then, if necessary, observe ModelChoiceField validation error handling at:
Observed scope: `django/forms/models.py:1300-1320`
```
This would cater to validation interactions if issues persist post-setup. 

**Note**: Addressing test configuration is primary over immediate class method tracing.
==================================================
### Analysis of the Current Observed Code and Abnormal Behavior

#### Code Analysis:

- The `ModelMultipleChoiceField` class extends from `ModelChoiceField`, providing additional functionality specifically for handling multiple choices in forms.
- The class defines several attributes and methods, including `widget`, `hidden_widget`, `default_error_messages`, `__init__()`, `to_python()`, and `clean()`.

#### Abnormal Behavior:

- The observed issue arises from the lack of a proper Django settings module, resulting in a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the `reproducer` module.
- This issue halts any further execution before reaching the point where it could handle inputs or validation with `ModelChoiceField` and `ModelMultipleChoiceField`.

### Current Task Focus:

Given the context, the issue originates not from a problem within `ModelMultipleChoiceField` itself but rather from an improperly configured Django environment, preventing tests from running. Therefore, further observation within the form-related functions or validation functions won't address the root cause. 

The main task is therefore to correctly configure the Django environment, ensuring the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` points to a valid settings file.

### Next Steps:

To proceed and locate any bugs within the `ModelChoiceField` related to the original ValidationError issue, first, ensure the Django test setup is functioning correctly. Then, consider observing methods dealing with value validation and error message formatting once the environment is corrected.

#### Current Decision:

Since the primary issue is environmental and setup-related, and based on the previous context given, pinpointing a buggy method without correct environment setup for further execution seems premature. However, should you get past setup issues, examining validation-related methods in `ModelChoiceField` would be next.

Since I haven’t physically altered the settings setup problem yet:

**Observed Method for Further Trace After Setup Correction:**

```plaintext
Observed method: django/forms/models.py:ModelChoiceField.to_python
```

This method would typically handle transformation and validation logic where such behavior might reside.
==================================================
### Analysis of the Current Observed Code and Abnormal Behavior

#### Code Analysis:

- The `to_python` method in `ModelChoiceField` attempts to convert the input value to its respective database object by using its primary key or another specified field (`to_field_name`).
- It checks if the input value is in `empty_values`, returning `None` if so.
- It tries to retrieve the model instance from the `queryset` using the key value extracted from the input.
- If the value isn't found (or there's a value or type error), it raises a `ValidationError` with the message specified in `self.error_messages['invalid_choice']`.

#### Abnormal Behavior:

- The observed issue in the test setup arises due to a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the `reproducer.settings`, stemming from a misconfiguration rather than an intrinsic problem with the `to_python` method itself.
- The execution hasn't progressed to invoke `to_python` due to the environment setup issue.

### Current Task Focus:

As the primary issue is related to Django's environment configuration (`ModuleNotFoundError`), one cannot ascertain directly within `to_python` about any intrinsic method bugs without the script running through the validation flow. Therefore, the immediate action is correcting the module setup to enable full execution.

### Immediate Resolution:

To proceed forward effectively, ensure the Django setup is valid by either creating a dummy `reproducer.settings` configured properly or pointing the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` to an existing settings file.

Once corrected, you can then evaluate whether `invalid_choice` errors do correctly encapsulate the invalid input value or if further changes are needed within `to_python`.

### Next Steps:

1. **Fix Environment Setup:**
   - Ensure a proper Django configuration to allow searching for errors within the validations framework (such as in `to_python`).

2. **Validation Method Inspection (if needed):**
   - Post-setup, if the `ValidationError` doesn't relay the invalid choice value correctly, adjustments may be necessary.

Since the actual issue here is setup related rather than method logic related, setting the Django environment takes precedence before any actual tracing needed within the method would happen.

Given this, the buggy method cannot be identified due to setup issues preventing execution. Here's what needs targeting:

### For Environment Setup Error Resolution:
Update `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` to point to a valid settings file.

### If Further Exploration is Required after Setup Correction:
If necessary to debug validation issue after setup:

```plaintext
Observed scope: django/forms/fields.py:240-260
```

This focus would cover typical validation processes where error handling for invalid data input like `invalid_choice` could reside. However, confirming that behavior post-reconfiguration should be the starting point.
==================================================
### Analysis of the Current Observed Code and Abnormal Program Behavior

#### Code Analysis:

The `to_python` function in `ModelChoiceField` is tasked with converting an input value into an associated model object. Specifically, it:

- Validates if the input is considered empty and treats it as `None`.
- Attempts to retrieve a model instance from the provided queryset using a primary key or field name.
- If the value retrieval fails (due to a non-existent or incorrect key), it raises a `ValidationError` with a message specified in `self.error_messages['invalid_choice']`.

#### Abnormal Behavior:

- The error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'reproducer'` indicates that the current script cannot proceed beyond the initial Django setup. This is due to the absence of a valid Django settings configuration, preventing the test case from executing and reaching any form validation logic.
- There is no fault within the `to_python` method itself based on this run; rather, the issue is about missing configurations required for the test to advance.

### Current Task Focus:

Given the setup setup problem, the proper Django settings are missing or the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is pointing to a nonexistent configuration. Addressing this will enable the code execution environment, thus allowing potential tracing within `to_python` or any other method within the form to be meaningful.

### Immediate Steps:

The immediate step is addressing test environment misconfiguration:

1. **Fix Environment Setup**: Ensure a suitable settings path within `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`.
   - Create a mock settings file if needed.
   - Correct the environment variable to reference usable settings.
2. **Verify Test Execution**: Once the environment is correctly configured, execute the test to see if the ValidationError issue presents itself when passing invalid choices to a `ModelChoiceField`.

### Conclusion:

The current problem leading to `ModuleNotFoundError` is setup-related and not due to buggy code in `ModelChoiceField.to_python` or any other method. Once environment issues are resolved, investigate if the behavior of `to_python` meets expectations.

Buggy method identification isn't feasible right now due to setup issues; tracing ahead without environment fixation is therefore not warranted. The next focus should be purely correcting:

```plaintext
Observed method: django/conf/__init__.py:Settings.__init__
```

But ensure environment setup correctness first, as further code tracing relies on the basic configurational resolution.
==================================================
### Analysis of the Current Observed Code and Abnormal Program Behavior

#### Code Analysis:

The runtime analysis pertains to the `Settings.__init__` method within Django's configuration module. It involves initializing the settings:

- **Setting up from Global:** The code iterates through global settings, using any uppercase attributes.
- **Settings Module:** Attempts import of the module designated by `settings_module`.
- **Handling and Checks:** Post-import, it validates configuration settings for essential tuples and manages timezone.

#### Abnormal Behavior:

The abnormal behavior stems from the attempt to import a non-existent module as specified by `settings_module`, in this case, `'reproducer.settings'`. This results in the `ModuleNotFoundError` blocking further setup and execution flow.

### Root Cause Assurance:

Given the trace, the issue arises from the line:

```python
141     mod = importlib.import_module(self.SETTINGS_MODULE)
```

This means no suitable module is found or configured within the given environment path for the script.

### Immediate Steps:

To correct the environment setup before executing further code tracing, ascertain the accuracy of the setting path or supply a valid settings configuration in the environment.

### Buggy Code Analysis:

Diving deeper into the current issue with configuration confirms the setup isn't directly within the `Settings.__init__` method but relies on the environment setup, hence it cannot be labeled as method buggy in usual case unless system-level corrections apply.

Correcting the environment is pivotal to progress:

```python
Buggy method: `django/conf/__init__.py:Settings.__init__`
```

### Next Confirmation Steps:

Ensuring `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` correctly references an available settings module or create one if necessary. Follow this by a test script update to work through actual validation instances desired in the original task.

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To address the issue of the `ModelChoiceField` not providing the value of an invalid choice in its `ValidationError`, I intend to explore the `ModelChoiceField` class's `to_python` method or any other validation methods if present that interact with error messaging.

The `ModelMultipleChoiceField` already supplies the value in its error message with the format `'%(value)s'` being part of `self.error_messages['invalid_choice']`. We need to ensure `ModelChoiceField` behaves similarly when raising a validation error for `invalid_choice`.

Before generating the patch, I need to retrieve the source code for `ModelChoiceField` and its associated methods to verify and modify the behavior regarding handling invalid inputs.

I need to use the `search_class_in_file` API to retrieve the full class implementation and explore areas specific to validation errors:

I am ready to modify the error message to include the invalid choice value.

Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:

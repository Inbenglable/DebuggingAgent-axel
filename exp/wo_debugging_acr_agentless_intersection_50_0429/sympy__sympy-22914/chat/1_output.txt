To resolve this issue, I need to identify where the `PythonCodePrinter` class is located in the SymPy codebase to add the methods `_print_Min` and `_print_Max`. I will search for the location of the `PythonCodePrinter` class and understand its current implementation to make the necessary additions.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("PythonCodePrinter")
```

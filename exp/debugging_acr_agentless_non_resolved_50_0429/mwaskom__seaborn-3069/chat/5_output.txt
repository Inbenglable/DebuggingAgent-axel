The error is arising from the failure in tick positions adjustment for nominal scales in the `_finalize_figure` method of the `Plotter` class. The provided code outlines the current logic related to axis limits, which attempts to adjust categorical axis limits for string tick labels (`lo` and `hi`) by offsetting them by 0.5.

To fix the bug, the `_finalize_figure` method should be updated to incorporate logics that handle the nominal scales properly for the categories, ensuring they use similar margins and grid visibility as categorical scales.

Considering I've already received the relevant `Plotter._finalize_figure` method source code, I can now proceed to patch the bug by adjusting how nominal scales handle tick marks and limits.

Ready generation: `True`

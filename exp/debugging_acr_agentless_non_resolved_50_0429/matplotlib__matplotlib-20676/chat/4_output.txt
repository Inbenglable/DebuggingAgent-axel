Based on the observed code snippet and runtime tracing of the `SpanSelector.__init__` method, the setup of edge handles using `self._setup_edge_handle(props)` appears to be involved in modifying the axes limits when in interactive mode. Here, we see the method call to `_setup_edge_handle`, which influences the axes limits but does not directly explain the shift of x-limits to include 0.

The `_setup_edge_handle` method initializes `_edge_handles` using `ToolLineHandles` and modifies internal properties with `props`. However, the bug likely requires further examination of how `ToolLineHandles` interacts with axes limits during the widget's interactive mode.

The method `ToolLineHandles` is part of the setup, and it contains the following parameters:
- `ax`: the axis object associated with the `SpanSelector`.
- `extents`: which seems related to minimum and maximum values that might impact axes dimensions.
- `direction`: horizontal in this case.
These parameters might be influencing axes limits during interactive mode.

To identify the root cause of the bug, understanding how `ToolLineHandles` operates during interactive selection is essential. Therefore, the next step involves tracing how `ToolLineHandles` is set up and whether it impacts axis limits.

Observed method: `lib/matplotlib/widgets.py:ToolLineHandles.__init__`

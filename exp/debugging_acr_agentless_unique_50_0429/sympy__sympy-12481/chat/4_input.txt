## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
`Permutation` constructor fails with non-disjoint cycles
Calling `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` raises a `ValueError` instead of constructing the identity permutation.  If the cycles passed in are non-disjoint, they should be applied in left-to-right order and the resulting permutation should be returned.

This should be easy to compute.  I don't see a reason why non-disjoint cycles should be forbidden.

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
Based on the test execution output and traceback provided, the problem arises during the instantiation of the `Permutation` object: specifically when calling the `__new__` method of the `Permutation` class with `args` set to `[[0, 1], [0, 1]]`.

The `ValueError` is raised because the `__new__` method detects repeating elements within the cycles, which it currently interprets as invalid input. The intention behind the raising of the error seems to be enforcing disjoint underlying cycles, but the reported issue suggests that non-disjoint cycles should be allowed and their effect compounded left-to-right to form the identity permutation when possible.

To further explore the precise logic that leads to the exception, I would focus on examining the handling of `args` within the `__new__` method, specifically where it assesses cycle validity. As the exception is thrown from line 900, let's inspect the related method further.

Observed method: `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py:Permutation.__new__`
==================================================
The issue seems to originate from the logic within the `Permutation.__new__` method, specifically in how it handles cycle detection and management. When the cycles are not disjoint, the current implementation raises a `ValueError` (as seen in line 900 and line 901 of sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py). The issue report suggests that instead of throwing an exception, the permutation should respect the cycle notation's order and create the resultant permutation. However, line 900 is currently enforcing disjoint elements by raising a `ValueError` when duplicates are detected.

The relevant section of the code causing the problem is:

```python
if has_dups(temp):
    if is_cycle:
        raise ValueError('there were repeated elements; to resolve '
        'cycles use Cycle%s.' % ''.join([str(tuple(c)) for c in args]))
    else:
        raise ValueError('there were repeated elements.')
```

To verify the hypothesis and pinpoint the exact problem, observe the lines directly handling cycle formation and redundancy checks, particularly lines 897-917.

Observed scope: `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py:897-917`
==================================================
To resolve the issue, I will analyze the current observed anomalous program behavior:

The `Permutation.__new__` method is designed to create a new Permutation object using cycle notation. However, the code in lines 897-917 raises a `ValueError` when duplicate elements are found, which enforces the use of disjoint cycles. The key lines are:

```python
897         temp = flatten(args)
898         if has_dups(temp):
899             if is_cycle:
900                 raise ValueError('there were repeated elements; to resolve '
901                 'cycles use Cycle%s.' % ''.join([str(tuple(c)) for c in args]))
902             else:
903                 raise ValueError('there were repeated elements.')
```

The code checks for duplicate elements using `has_dups`. If duplicates are found, it raises a `ValueError`, preventing the creation of the Permutation object. This logic is problematic when handling non-disjoint cycles, as reported in the issue.

Instead of raising an error, the method should instead apply non-disjoint cycles in left-to-right order, meaning the cycles should be applied sequentially to create the resulting permutation. 

Given the description and current observation, it appears that the `__new__` method in `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` is indeed the buggy method that needs to be fixed.

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

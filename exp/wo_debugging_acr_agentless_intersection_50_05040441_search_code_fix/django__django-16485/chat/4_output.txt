After reviewing the provided patch and the test outputs before and after its application, the results are as follows:

1. **Patch Review:** 
   - The patch tries to modify the logic that determines the units of precision for quantization in the `floatformat` function.
   - It changes the assignment of `units` to make sure it's set to at least `1`. This should ensure that the precision doesn't fall below an acceptable level, specifically for input cases like `'0.00'`.

2. **Test Output Analysis:**
   - **Original Output:** The test causes the `floatformat` function to raise a `ValueError`, indicating a problem with setting the precision context (`valid range for prec is [1, MAX_PREC]`).
   - **Patched Output:** The exact same error occurs as in the original output. This means that the patch did not resolve the issue.

**Conclusion:**

The patch did not successfully address the error, as the same `ValueError` is encountered after applying it. Consequently, the issue is not resolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

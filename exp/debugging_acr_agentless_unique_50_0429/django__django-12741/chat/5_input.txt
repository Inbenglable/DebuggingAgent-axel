You are a PR reviewer that needs to review the patch generated by a bug repair agent and determine whether the issue is fixed or not.
This is the bug issue, which is in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Simplify signature of `DatabaseOperations.execute_sql_flush()`
Description
	
The current signature is:
def execute_sql_flush(self, using, sql_list):
The using argument can be dropped and inferred by the calling instance: self.connection.alias.
def execute_sql_flush(self, sql_list):
Some internal ises of this method are already doing:
connection.ops.execute_sql_flush(connection.alias, sql_flush)

</ISSUE>


Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
## REPRODUCE TEST
```
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import connection
from django.db.backends.sqlite3.base import DatabaseWrapper

# Configure minimal settings
settings.configure(
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': ':memory:',
        }
    }
)

# Create a test table and insert some data
with connection.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute("CREATE TABLE test_table (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);")
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO test_table (name) VALUES ('test1'), ('test2');")

# Verify data exists
with connection.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM test_table;")
    count_before = cursor.fetchone()[0]
    print(f"Records before flush: {count_before}")

# Test the new method signature
sql_list = ["DELETE FROM test_table;"]
connection.ops.execute_sql_flush(sql_list)

# Verify data was deleted
with connection.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM test_table;")
    count_after = cursor.fetchone()[0]
    print(f"Records after flush: {count_after}")

print("Test completed successfully!")
```

And this is the original output when running the test (before applying the patch):
## ORIGINAL OUTPUT
```
Records before flush: 2
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-12741/reproduce.py", line 28, in <module>
    connection.ops.execute_sql_flush(sql_list)
TypeError: execute_sql_flush() missing 1 required positional argument: 'sql_list'

```

The repair agent has tried to generate a patch to fix the issue:
## PATCH CONTEXT
<PATCH_CONTEXT>
To address the issue and simplify the signature of the `DatabaseOperations.execute_sql_flush` method, I'll be adjusting the method's signature and modifying its internal logic to infer the `using` parameter from `self.connection.alias`.

Here's the search/replace patch that will resolve the issue:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/backends/base/operations.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    def execute_sql_flush(self, using, sql_list):\n=======\n    def execute_sql_flush(self, sql_list):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/backends/base/operations.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    with transaction.atomic(using=using, savepoint=self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl):\n=======\n    with transaction.atomic(using=self.connection.alias, savepoint=self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Method Signature Update:**
   - **Search:** `def execute_sql_flush(self, using, sql_list):`
   - **Replace:** `def execute_sql_flush(self, sql_list):`
   - This change removes the `using` parameter from the method signature as per the requirement and the internal plan to infer the connection alias instead.

2. **Parameter Inference Update:**
   - **Search:** `with transaction.atomic(using=using, savepoint=self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl):`
   - **Replace:** `with transaction.atomic(using=self.connection.alias, savepoint=self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl):`
   - This change modifies the internal logic to use `self.connection.alias` directly, thereby eliminating reliance on the external `using` argument. 

These edits maintain the original functionality but make the method signature more streamlined and intuitive by leveraging the object state for configuration.
</PATCH_CONTEXT>

After applying the patch, the output of the test is:
## PATCHED OUTPUT
```
Records before flush: 2
Records after flush: 0
Test completed successfully!

```

Now, please first review the patch and analyse the test output before and after the patch, to determine whether the issue is fixed or not.

You need to trace the abnormal program to resolve project issues and submit pull requests.
Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Add transaction handling to Changelist list_editable processing.
Description
	
It seems that changelist_view in Django admin is missing a transaction. Since the view may change data in database, it should be wrapped in a transaction to prevent unexpected states in case of errors.

</ISSUE>


Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:

This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
The error log indicates an `ImproperlyConfigured` error due to accessing Django settings before they're properly configured. The issue arises when accessing the setting `INSTALLED_APPS`, which suggests that the Django settings have not been initialized with `os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'myproject.settings')` or some other method of configuring the settings.

This problem is occurring early in the script execution, likely because the settings are not set up before importing certain Django components that need them (like models or admin classes). Specifically, the imports begin to fail when attempting to import `User` from `django.contrib.auth.models`, as this action seems to rely on the settings being ready.

To further diagnose and confirm the issue, let's analyze whether the method involving the configuration check is somehow being prematurely triggered. We will trace the execution beginning at this crucial point to see any further details that indicate how the settings are being accessed or what imports occur beforehand.

Observed method: `django/conf/__init__.py:_setup`
==================================================
The current issue we are facing is that the Django settings have not been properly configured before certain Django components are accessed, resulting in an `ImproperlyConfigured` error. According to the given trace and observed code in the `LazySettings._setup` method, if the environment variable `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is not set, the settings cannot be loaded, and this leads to the aforementioned error.

From the code in the test script, the settings are set up initially using `os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'myproject.settings')`. However, this might not be happening at the correct point in time or might not be set properly before Django components are accessed.

Given the method `_setup` in `django/conf/__init__.py`, it is clear that the exception raised due to the missing or improperly configured settings occurs while setting up the wrapped settings object.

To investigate further, we should focus on the specific lines in `LazySettings._setup` where the environment variable is checked and the exception is raised. This will help us understand if there is a different place that accesses settings prematurely or misses the setup before the `LazySettings` logic proceeds.

Let's further trace within the `_setup` method to ensure that the environment setting and loading issues are handled properly, especially focusing on the initial lines before the exception is raised.

Observed scope: `django/conf/__init__.py:69-77`
==================================================


Now you choose LazySettings._setup's code snippet 
    69	        settings_module = os.environ.get(ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE)
    70	        if not settings_module:
    71	            desc = ("setting %s" % name) if name else "settings"
    72	            raise ImproperlyConfigured(
    73	                "Requested %s, but settings are not configured. "
    74	                "You must either define the environment variable %s "
    75	                "or call settings.configure() before accessing settings."
    76	                % (desc, ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE)
    77	            )

for further observation, tracing the abnormal program behavior.

This is the runtime information of the code snippet you choose to observed in LazySettings._setup:

You need to trace the abnormal program behavior step by step to identify the root cause of the bug and locate the buggy method that contains the code to be fixed.
Now, please first analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior. 

Then, if you can already locate the buggy method and buggy code, reply with:  
Buggy method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Otherwise, continue tracing by selecting the next method to observe. Reply with: 
Observed method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Note that {FILE_PATH} refers to the path relative to the repository. And if you want to observe a method inside a class, please specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME.

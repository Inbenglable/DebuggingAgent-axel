To address the issue of incorrect LaTeX parenthesizing of the `Subs` object, I need to investigate the current implementation of the LaTeX printer related to `Subs`. I need to locate the printing method likely responsible for this in the `sympy` codebase, focusing on LaTeX representation specifically for the `Subs` class.

To proceed, I will start by searching for the `Subs` class to get its location, then find the relevant method in the LaTeX printer code that handles `Subs`.

Let's perform the necessary searches:

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Subs")
search_method_in_codebase("latex")
```

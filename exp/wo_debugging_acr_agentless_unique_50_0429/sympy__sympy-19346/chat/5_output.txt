I have already retrieved the `reprify` method code from the `ReprPrinter` class. However, since the issue involves the incorrect printing of `dict` and `set`, I should check if there are specific print methods for these data structures within the `ReprPrinter` class. This may involve retrieving `_print_dict` and `_print_set` if they exist.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/repr.py", "ReprPrinter._print_dict")
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/repr.py", "ReprPrinter._print_set")
```

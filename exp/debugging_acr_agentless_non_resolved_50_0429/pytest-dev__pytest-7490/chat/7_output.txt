Based on the observations so far, the issue seems to be related to the way pytest handles the discovery and collection of test paths. The error message indicates that pytest cannot find the test specified as `reproducer.py::test_xfail_test`, which implies a problem in the test discovery and collection mechanism.

From the `Session.collect` method, it seems that pytest is iterating over the test arguments (`fspath` and `parts`), and attempting to collect tests using the `_collect` method. The failure to locate the test suggests that either the file path resolution, the collection mechanism itself, or the way pytest handles dynamic markers has changed or is broken.

Given this information, it would be useful to investigate further into how the `_collect` method processes these paths or handles markers. This potentially lies at the core of the observed issue.

To narrow down further, I will trace the `_collect` method call to understand how paths are being handled and to find out why this test path is not recognized:

Observed scope: `src/_pytest/main.py:585-587` (This scope directly follows the line where `yield from self._collect(fspath, parts)` is called.)

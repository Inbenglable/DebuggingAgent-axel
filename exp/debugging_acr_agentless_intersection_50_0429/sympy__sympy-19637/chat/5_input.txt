You are a PR reviewer that needs to review the patch generated by a bug repair agent and determine whether the issue is fixed or not.
This is the bug issue, which is in the **sympy** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
kernS: 'kern' referenced before assignment
from sympy.core.sympify import kernS

text = "(2*x)/(x-1)"
expr = kernS(text)  
//  hit = kern in s
// UnboundLocalError: local variable 'kern' referenced before assignment

</ISSUE>


Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
## REPRODUCE TEST
```
import traceback
import sys
from sympy.core.sympify import kernS

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    text = "(2*x)/(x-1)"
    try:
        expr = kernS(text)
    except UnboundLocalError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("UnboundLocalError: local variable 'kern' referenced before assignment")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

And this is the original output when running the test (before applying the patch):
## ORIGINAL OUTPUT

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

```

The repair agent has tried to generate a patch to fix the issue:
## PATCH CONTEXT
<PATCH_CONTEXT>
To resolve the issue where the 'kern' variable is referenced before assignment in the `kernS` function, we need to initialize `kern` before it's used in the line `hit = kern in s`. Here's how to fix it properly without disrupting the overall functionality:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/core/sympify.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    hit = False\n    quoted = '\"' in s or \"'\" in s\n=======\n    kern = ''\n    hit = False\n    quoted = '\"' in s or \"'\" in s\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This change ensures that `kern` is initialized as an empty string initially, which prevents the `UnboundLocalError` if the subsequent conditions that assign a unique value to `kern` are not met.
</PATCH_CONTEXT>

After applying the patch, the output of the test is:
## PATCHED OUTPUT
```

```

Now, please first review the patch and analyse the test output before and after the patch, to determine whether the issue is fixed or not.

And finally, tell me whether the issue is fixed or not by replying with:
Issue resolved: `True/False`

To address the issue, we need to ensure that `kern` is defined before it is used. In the current context, `kern` is only defined if a certain condition (`' ' in s`) is met, which can lead to it being referenced without an assignment when that condition isn't true. We should initialize `kern` at the beginning to avoid this problem.

Here's the patch to fix the issue:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/core/sympify.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    hit = False\n=======\n    kern = ''\n    hit = False\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This edit initializes `kern` as an empty string at the start of the function, ensuring it's defined before any conditional assignment.

To generate the patch, I need to modify the way SVG links are constructed within the `render_dot_html` method. Specifically, I need to ensure that the link paths are correctly calculated relative to the file path where the SVG is embedded.

To proceed, I need to retrieve the full source code of the `render_dot_html` method to analyze how it constructs the SVG content and manipulate the link correction. I'll retrieve this specific method's source code.

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/ext/graphviz.py", "render_dot_html")
```

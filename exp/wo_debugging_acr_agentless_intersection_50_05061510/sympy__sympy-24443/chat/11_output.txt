The patch modifies the `_check_homomorphism` function by updating the `_image` function so that it correctly handles inverted generators within the `PermutationGroup`. The changes involve:

1. Adding a condition to check if either `r[i]` or its inverse `r[i]**-1` is in the set of generators (`gens`).
2. Introducing a conditional branch to correctly identify whether to use the generator or its inverse for constructing the image.

Before the patch, attempting to create a homomorphism with `D3` (a dihedral group) resulted in a `ValueError`, indicating that the images didn't define a homomorphism.

After applying the patch, the test output shows no exceptions being raised, suggesting that the issue might have been fixed. This implies that the code correctly identifies and processes both generators and their inverses, thus handling the scenario that was causing the exception.

Given that the patched output confirms that no exception was raised during the homomorphism creation, indicating the code now operates as expected, I would conclude:

Issue resolved: `True`

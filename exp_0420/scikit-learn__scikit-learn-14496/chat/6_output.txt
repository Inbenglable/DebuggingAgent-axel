To resolve the issue, we need to ensure that the `min_samples` parameter is correctly converted to an integer when necessary. The problematic part is within the `compute_optics_graph` function, specifically the following code snippet:

```python
if min_samples <= 1:
    min_samples = max(2, min_samples * n_samples)
```

We need to modify it to convert `min_samples` to an integer before it is passed to `NearestNeighbors`. 

Given the retrieved code, I'm ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

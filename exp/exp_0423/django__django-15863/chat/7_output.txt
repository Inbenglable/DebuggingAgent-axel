To generate a patch, I need to first retrieve the source code for the `floatformat` method from `django/template/defaultfilters.py` in order to examine and understand the existing implementation and make the necessary changes to address the precision issue with `Decimal` objects.

Therefore, I will search for the `floatformat` method in the specified file to retrieve its source code.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/template/defaultfilters.py", "floatformat")
```

Based on the provided information, you need to identify the files that are responsible for migration generation in Django. Specifically, you're looking for files that would contain code related to writing or generating migration files, as the issue pertains to fixing the order of import statements in automatically generated migration files.

After analyzing the API results, it seems the actual code related to migration generation logic wouldn't be in the test migration files or actual migrations that are listed. Those files are mostly examples or boilerplate for actual migrations which do not give insight into how migration files are generated.

The `django/db/migrations/migration.py` file is the base class for all migrations, and while it's important for understanding how migrations function, it may not contain code related to generating migration files themselves. It might contain methods that the generation logic calls, but the generation logic itself might be in files in `django.db.migrations`, particularly ones associated with writers or commands.

Therefore, none of the listed migration files appear directly relevant for the migration generation logic or related functions for generating the ordering of import statements. The results donâ€™t provide direct references to classes or methods like `MigrationWriter`, `write_migration_file`, or any equivalent code sections that handle the generation of migrations.

Given this consideration, none of the returned files are directly relevant to solving the problem at hand.

Final selected files:

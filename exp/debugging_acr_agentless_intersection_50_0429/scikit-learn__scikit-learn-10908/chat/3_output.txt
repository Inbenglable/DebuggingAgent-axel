The current traceback suggests that the problem originates from the `_check_vocabulary` method in the `VectorizerMixin` class. The runtime error indicates that `check_is_fitted(self, 'vocabulary_')` fails because the `vocabulary_` attribute is not considered to be set, even though a `vocabulary` was provided during initialization.

To resolve this issue, it would be necessary to delve deeper into how the `vocabulary_` attribute is managed during the initialization process of `CountVectorizer`. This involves ensuring that when the `vocabulary` parameter is given, the `vocabulary_` attribute should be properly assigned, which would prevent the `NotFittedError`.

Based on the analysis, I need to trace the initialization process in the `CountVectorizer` class to determine where and why `vocabulary_` is not assigned properly.

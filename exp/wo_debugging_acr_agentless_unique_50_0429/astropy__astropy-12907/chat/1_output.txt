To resolve the issue with the `separability_matrix` incorrectly computing separability for nested `CompoundModels`, I need to examine the source code for the `separability_matrix` function to understand how it computes the separability matrix and why it might be failing for nested compound models. 

Since I don't have the file path where the function `separability_matrix` is defined, I will search for it in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("separability_matrix")
```

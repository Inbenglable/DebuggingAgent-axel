The current error, as clarified through the observation of the `Apps.check_apps_ready` method, emphasizes the lack of a configured Django environment. Specifically, Django's settings need to be properly initialized before any model definitions or operations that require application configuration checks. The code trace points out that this involves the settings initialization, reflected in the exception raised at `settings.INSTALLED_APPS`.

The abnormal behavior results directly from trying to utilize Django environments and objects without configuring Django settings first, thereby leading to `ImproperlyConfigured` exceptions.

From the trace, we need to focus on ensuring Django settings initialization before any models or database operations.

Based on this, the problematic area is not within a particular method that needs logical corrections, but rather in the lacking setup of Django settings for the test script to run outside of a fully-fledged Django environment. 

Thus, it's essential to rectify the environment configuration steps.

Observed scope: `django/conf/__init__.py:54-61`

Let's continue by focusing on the setup method within `LazySettings`, as this will provide insights into how settings are accessed and point out the problem of configuration needs.

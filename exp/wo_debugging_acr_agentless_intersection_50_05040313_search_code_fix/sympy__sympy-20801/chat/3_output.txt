To fix the issue, we need to understand how the `==` operator is overloaded and operates between `BooleanAtom` (or its instances like `S.false`) and `Float` or `Integer`. The key method under consideration is likely `Basic.__eq__`, as it handles equality for SymPy objects. We have obtained this method's code. Next, I'll verify whether there are specific methods for equality in the Float or BooleanAtom classes or whether `Basic.__eq__` covers all scenarios.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/core/numbers.py", "Float.__eq__")
search_method_in_file("sympy/logic/boolalg.py", "BooleanAtom.__eq__")
search_method_in_file("sympy/core/numbers.py", "Integer.__eq__")
```

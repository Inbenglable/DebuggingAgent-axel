The original issue is about a `FileField` with a storage callable that may return `default_storage`, where the deconstruction fails to include this callable correctly in migrations. The patch modifies the deconstruction logic to handle callables by checking if a `_storage_callable` exists, ensuring it gets serialized appropriately.

The key points to consider in both the original and patched outputs are identical. In both cases, the failure isn't directly related to the logic that the patch is supposed to correct. Instead, it points to an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception due to missing or improperly set `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`, resulting in the wrapping storage settings not being correctly initialized.

The issue indicated by the output, both before and after the patch, seems to be configuration-related rather than an error with deconstruction logic. Hence, the test results do not currently verify whether the patch successfully fixes the original reported issue about storage callables because it's not reaching the part where deconstruction is tested.

In this context, we can't definitively conclude from these results whether the patch resolves the original issue as the underlying test setup is not correctly configured.

Issue resolved: `False`

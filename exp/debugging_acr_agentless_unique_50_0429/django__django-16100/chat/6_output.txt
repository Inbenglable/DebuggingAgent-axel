Analyzing the provided runtime information, the main issue arises from the improper configuration of Django settings before attempting to access models. The exception thrown is `django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured`, indicating that the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting is being accessed without the Django environment being properly set up.

The method `Apps.check_apps_ready()` checks if the Django apps have been imported, which requires the settings to be configured. The key line leading to the issue is:

- Line 137 in `django/apps/registry.py`: `settings.INSTALLED_APPS`

It attempts to access `INSTALLED_APPS`, causing an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception because the settings have not been set up yet. The root cause seems to be that the test script is not correctly setting up the Django environment before models are being accessed.

In the reproduced runtime information, the improper setup starts with the import statement:

```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
```

without prior setup of Django settings. Before proceeding with deeper analysis, the setup environment line in the test script should ensure it correctly configures Django settings before any imports that rely on these settings.

As of now, the scope contains both code logic and setup issues, so it's not fully conclusive to pinpoint the exact method causing the bug until the environment is correctly set up. 

To further trace the underlying code, I would need to inspect the initial setup and interaction with Django's configuration. Therefore, I will choose to observe the following scope within the test setup:

Observed scope: `django/conf/__init__.py:72-92`

This scope will provide insight into how settings are resolved internally, which is crucial for tracking down potential misconfigurations leading to the exception.

To resolve the issue of unnecessary joins in the admin changelist query, I've reviewed the code responsible for constructing search queries within the `get_search_results` method in the `ModelAdmin` class. This method is key to handling search queries in Django's admin panel. Now, I am ready to generate the patch to optimize the search functionality to avoid unnecessary joins.

Ready generation: `True`

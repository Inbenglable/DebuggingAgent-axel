## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Using symbols to create functions doesn't work if there is an extra layer of parentheses
Sympy version == 1.10.1

Using `symbols` to create symbol-like objects like instances of `Function` as shown in the [documentation](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/core.html?highlight=symbols#symbols) creates objects of class `Symbol` instead of `Function` if there is an extra layer of parentheses.

The extra layer of parentheses are necessary to deconstruct the output as separate tuples.

Running the code:
```
q, u = smp.symbols(('q:2', 'u:2'), cls=smp.Function)
print(type(q[0]))
```
#### Expected result:
<class 'sympy.core.function.UndefinedFunction'>

#### Actual result: 
<class 'sympy.core.symbol.Symbol'>

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To understand the issue with the `symbols` function regarding the use of additional parentheses, it's crucial to examine the implementation of the `symbols` function itself in SymPy's codebase. Given that the specific file containing this function isn't immediately known, I would need to search for its implementation across the codebase.

Let's proceed with retrieving the source code of the `symbols` function.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("symbols")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("symbols")
RESULT:
#### sympy/core/symbol.py:symbols
```python
def symbols(names, *, cls=Symbol, **args) -> Any:
    r"""
    Transform strings into instances of :class:`Symbol` class.

    :func:`symbols` function returns a sequence of symbols with names taken
    from ``names`` argument, which can be a comma or whitespace delimited
    string, or a sequence of strings::

        >>> from sympy import symbols, Function

        >>> x, y, z = symbols('x,y,z')
        >>> a, b, c = symbols('a b c')

    The type of output is dependent on the properties of input arguments::

        >>> symbols('x')
        x
        >>> symbols('x,')
        (x,)
        >>> symbols('x,y')
        (x, y)
        >>> symbols(('a', 'b', 'c'))
        (a, b, c)
        >>> symbols(['a', 'b', 'c'])
        [a, b, c]
        >>> symbols({'a', 'b', 'c'})
        {a, b, c}

    If an iterable container is needed for a single symbol, set the ``seq``
    argument to ``True`` or terminate the symbol name with a comma::

        >>> symbols('x', seq=True)
        (x,)

    To reduce typing, range syntax is supported to create indexed symbols.
    Ranges are indicated by a colon and the type of range is determined by
    the character to the right of the colon. If the character is a digit
    then all contiguous digits to the left are taken as the nonnegative
    starting value (or 0 if there is no digit left of the colon) and all
    contiguous digits to the right are taken as 1 greater than the ending
    value::

        >>> symbols('x:10')
        (x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8, x9)

        >>> symbols('x5:10')
        (x5, x6, x7, x8, x9)
        >>> symbols('x5(:2)')
        (x50, x51)

        >>> symbols('x5:10,y:5')
        (x5, x6, x7, x8, x9, y0, y1, y2, y3, y4)

        >>> symbols(('x5:10', 'y:5'))
        ((x5, x6, x7, x8, x9), (y0, y1, y2, y3, y4))

    If the character to the right of the colon is a letter, then the single
    letter to the left (or 'a' if there is none) is taken as the start
    and all characters in the lexicographic range *through* the letter to
    the right are used as the range::

        >>> symbols('x:z')
        (x, y, z)
        >>> symbols('x:c')  # null range
        ()
        >>> symbols('x(:c)')
        (xa, xb, xc)

        >>> symbols(':c')
        (a, b, c)

        >>> symbols('a:d, x:z')
        (a, b, c, d, x, y, z)

        >>> symbols(('a:d', 'x:z'))
        ((a, b, c, d), (x, y, z))

    Multiple ranges are supported; contiguous numerical ranges should be
    separated by parentheses to disambiguate the ending number of one
    range from the starting number of the next::

        >>> symbols('x:2(1:3)')
        (x01, x02, x11, x12)
        >>> symbols(':3:2')  # parsing is from left to right
        (00, 01, 10, 11, 20, 21)

    Only one pair of parentheses surrounding ranges are removed, so to
    include parentheses around ranges, double them. And to include spaces,
    commas, or colons, escape them with a backslash::

        >>> symbols('x((a:b))')
        (x(a), x(b))
        >>> symbols(r'x(:1\,:2)')  # or r'x((:1)\,(:2))'
        (x(0,0), x(0,1))

    All newly created symbols have assumptions set according to ``args``::

        >>> a = symbols('a', integer=True)
        >>> a.is_integer
        True

        >>> x, y, z = symbols('x,y,z', real=True)
        >>> x.is_real and y.is_real and z.is_real
        True

    Despite its name, :func:`symbols` can create symbol-like objects like
    instances of Function or Wild classes. To achieve this, set ``cls``
    keyword argument to the desired type::

        >>> symbols('f,g,h', cls=Function)
        (f, g, h)

        >>> type(_[0])
        <class 'sympy.core.function.UndefinedFunction'>

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

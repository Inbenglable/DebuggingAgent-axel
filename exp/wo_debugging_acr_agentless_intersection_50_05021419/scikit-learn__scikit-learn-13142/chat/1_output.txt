To analyze the issue further, I need to retrieve the source code for the `GaussianMixture` class and its `fit_predict` and `predict` methods to understand how they are working with the `n_init` parameter.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("GaussianMixture")
search_method_in_codebase("GaussianMixture.fit_predict")
search_method_in_codebase("GaussianMixture.predict")
```

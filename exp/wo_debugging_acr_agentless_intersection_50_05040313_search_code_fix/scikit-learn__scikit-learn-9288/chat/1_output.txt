To resolve the issue, we need to locate and understand the source code for the KMeans implementation. Looking at the `n_jobs` parameter, it's relevant to multithreading or parallel processing, which is typically managed by joblib or a similar library in scikit-learn. Therefore, I will need to search for the `KMeans` class and its method that handles fitting, as well as understand how job processing is handled in this implementation. 

I will start by retrieving the source code for the `KMeans` class and the `fit` method within this class, as this is likely where parallel processing is implemented.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("KMeans")
search_method_in_codebase("KMeans.fit")
```

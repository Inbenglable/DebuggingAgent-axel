The issue seems to be related to handling NaN values specifically in the `Axes.bar` method. The error trace suggests that the `_safe_first_finite` function in `cbook/__init__.py` is involved in the bug, as it's unable to find a finite number when the data is all NaN. To address the bug properly, I need to review the following parts of the code:

1. Review the `Axes.bar` method in `matplotlib/axes/_axes.py` where the error is initiated.
2. Review the `_safe_first_finite` method in `cbook/__init__.py` to understand how it's handling NaN data.

Let's proceed to retrieve the source code for these parts to understand the existing functionality and prepare for a patch.

```python
search_method_in_file("matplotlib/axes/_axes.py", "Axes.bar")
search_method_in_file("matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py", "_safe_first_finite")
```

## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Set default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.
Description
	
Hello,
As far as I can see, the ​File Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.
What I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).
The tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.
I found mentions of this issue ​on GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.

</ISSUE>


A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
The issue described involves inconsistent file permissions for uploaded files in the Django framework. The problem arises because the default behavior when using Python's `tempfile` library for temporary files results in permissions being set to `0o600` (read and write by the owner only), which is a more restrictive permission than the expected default of `0o644`.

The test script provided checks the file permissions after files are uploaded through Django's `FileSystemStorage`. The small file is uploaded as an `InMemoryUploadedFile`, and the large file is uploaded as a `TemporaryUploadedFile`. The permissions for `TemporaryUploadedFile` do not match the expectation due to how `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` sets permissions by default.

Given this information, the buggy behavior is related to how the permissions are applied in the `FileSystemStorage` during the `save` operation for temporary files. We need to trace the file saving mechanism within the `FileSystemStorage` to understand where the permissions should be enforced or modified.

Next, I will focus on the `FileSystemStorage.save` method since it encompasses the logic for saving files to the file system, which is where the permissions issue is relevant.

Observed method: `django/core/files/storage.py:FileSystemStorage.save`
==================================================
The issue at hand involves inconsistent file permissions when files are uploaded using Django's `FileSystemStorage`. The problematic behavior stems from the use of `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` for large file uploads, which results in the file permissions being set to `0o600` instead of the desired `0o644`. 

Currently, we've traced the `Storage.save` method, which calls the `_save` method of `FileSystemStorage`. The runtime information indicates that the assertion fails for `TemporaryUploadedFile`, as the permissions are `0o600` instead of `0o644`.

Since the permissions inconsistency occurs specifically during the file save operation, it's logical to investigate the underlying `_save` method, as that's where the file writing and permission setting are likely handled.

To pinpoint the offending code, I will need to observe the behavior of the `_save` method in more detail.

Observed scope: `django/core/files/storage.py:53-80`
==================================================
The current observed code snippet consists of the `get_available_name` method within Django's `FileSystemStorage` class. This method is responsible for ensuring that the filename provided is unique in the storage system by appending additional characters if needed. However, this method does not deal with file permissions directly; its main role is to handle naming conflicts.

The abnormal program behavior is that uploaded files through `FileSystemStorage` do not have the expected permissions. Specifically, files uploaded as `TemporaryUploadedFile` end up with `0o600` permissions rather than the expected `0o644`. This discrepancy arises because the default temporary file implementation in Python sets permissions to `0o600` for security reasons.

Given this, the faulty behavior relates to file permission changes during the file saving process rather than naming. We need to trace the part of the `FileSystemStorage` where file permissions are explicitly set or potentially overridden, which may happen in the lower-level `_save` method where the file is physically handled.

Next, I will observe the `_save` method within the `FileSystemStorage` class, as it is likely responsible for the file-saving logic and permissions management.

Observed method: `django/core/files/storage.py:FileSystemStorage._save`
==================================================
Based on the runtime information and the observed code in the `_save` method of the `FileSystemStorage` class in Django, we can see how file permissions are managed. Here is a summary of my analysis:

1. **Line 260**: The file descriptor is created with `os.open`, using flags and default permissions `0o666`. This is relevant because it sets the initial permissions for files being saved. The current umask will mask out parts of these permissions.

2. **Line 263-272**: If the item is a normal uploaded file (not a `TemporaryUploadedFile`), it will be written to disk here using these flags.

3. **Line 254-255**: If the content is a `TemporaryUploadedFile` (i.e., has a `temporary_file_path` attribute), it uses `file_move_safe` to move the temporary file to the destination. This move operation keeps the original file's permissions, which are set to `0o600` by the `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` mechanism, hence the observed permissions issue.

4. **Line 283**: After saving the file, if `self.file_permissions_mode` is defined, it changes the permissions using `os.chmod`. Due to the observed runtime info, it seems this line never applies the mode since `self.file_permissions_mode` is `None`. As a result, files remain with the permissions acquired during the storage process.

The problem arises because for `TemporaryUploadedFile`, the file is moved using `file_move_safe`, and no permissions adjustment occurs afterward. In the absence of `file_permissions_mode` being set explicitly, it does not apply `0o644` consistently. 

Given this, to fix the permissions for both types of file uploads, the permissions need to be explicitly set after moving the file. 

Buggy method: `django/core/files/storage.py:_save`
==================================================

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code for the `_save` method in the `FileSystemStorage` class since we need to make changes related to file permissions. I will use the `search_method_in_file` API to obtain the source code for this method.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/files/storage.py", "FileSystemStorage._save")
```

Your Output:
Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

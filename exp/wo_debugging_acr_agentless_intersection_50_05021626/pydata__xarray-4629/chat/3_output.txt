I have gathered the relevant code concerning the `merge` and `merge_core` functions, and the issue seems to be related to how `merge_attrs` handles the 'override' setting in `combine_attrs`. Looking at the implementation we obtained, the issue likely lies within the `merge_attrs` function when it processes attributes with `combine_attrs='override'`.

To further diagnose and fix the issue, I need to examine the `merge_attrs` function implementation to understand how it handles attribute overriding. Therefore, the next step is to retrieve the source code for this function.

```python
search_method_in_file("xarray/core/merge.py", "merge_attrs")
```

To resolve the issue with `Dataset.merge` when merging a `DataArray`, it's important to review the code for `dataset_merge_method`, as the `merge` function in the `Dataset` class calls this method. Let's retrieve the source code for `dataset_merge_method` found in `xarray/core/merge.py`.

```python
search_method_in_file("xarray/core/merge.py", "dataset_merge_method")
```

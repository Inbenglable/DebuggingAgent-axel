To resolve the issue with the `floatformat` template filter dropping precision for `Decimal` numbers, we need to inspect the implementation of the floatformat template filter in Django. Specifically, we should check how the conversion to float is handled and where we can make changes to avoid losing precision.

Since the task involves understanding the implementation details of the `floatformat` filter, we should first locate the relevant method in the Django codebase. Let's start by searching for the `floatformat` method.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("floatformat")
```

Before generating the patch, I need to retrieve the relevant section of the method where this snippet (`opts = cur_model._meta`) is located. This will help in understanding the context and ensure that the proposed fix (changing it to `opts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta`) is correctly applied within the method. Let's search for the method containing this code snippet.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/sql/query.py", "cur_model")
```

To address the issue, the problem with version comparison logically resides in the version-checking part of the code, possibly involving some functionality related to `needs_extensions`. It's likely that version comparison is handled outside of the immediate `setup_extension` method, given its simplistic structure.

To implement a fix, we must locate the method handling the actual version comparison. The comparison logic most likely misimplements string-based comparison where a robust comparison using a library like `packaging.version` should be used.

Let's locate the method or section of code where the version checking logic for extensions is implemented, probably in the same or related sections of the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("check_extension_version")
search_method_in_codebase("needs_extensions")
```

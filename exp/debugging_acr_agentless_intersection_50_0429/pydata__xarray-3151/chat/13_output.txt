To determine if the issue has been resolved, let's first analyze the given patch and the test outputs before and after applying the patch.

### Patch Review
The patch modifies the code in `xarray/core/combine.py`:

1. **Original Code**:
   ```python
   for dim in concatenated.dims:
       if dim in concatenated:
           indexes = concatenated.indexes.get(dim)
           if not (indexes.is_monotonic_increasing or indexes.is_monotonic_decreasing):
               raise ValueError("Resulting object does not have monotonic global indexes along dimension {}"
                                .format(dim))
   ```

   This code checks if the indexes along each dimension are monotonic, raising a `ValueError` if they are not. It does not differentiate between constant dimensions (where coordinates don't vary across datasets) and varying dimensions.

2. **Patched Code**:
   ```python
   dataset_coords = [set(ds.variables) for ds in datasets]
   constant_dims = set.intersection(*dataset_coords)
   
   for dim in concatenated.dims:
       if dim in concatenated and dim not in constant_dims:
           indexes = concatenated.indexes.get(dim)
           if not (indexes.is_monotonic_increasing or indexes.is_monotonic_decreasing):
               raise ValueError("Resulting object does not have monotonic global indexes along non-constant dimension {}"
                                .format(dim))
   ```

   The patched code introduces logic to identify constant dimensions using `set.intersection`. For these constant dimensions, the monotonicity check is skipped. This addresses the issue mentioned: constant coordinate dimensions should not require monotonicity, as per the initial bug report.

### Test Output
- **Original Output**:
  The test failed with a `ValueError`, and the subsequent assertion raised an `AssertionError`, indicating that the issue was present.

- **Patched Output**:
  The test ran without errors, indicating that the issue is no longer present. The message "Issue is fixed. Exiting with code 0." shows progression through the code without encountering the previous error condition.

### Conclusion
Based on the patch review and test output comparison, the patch correctly addresses the issue by excluding constant dimensions from monotonicity checks in the `combine_by_coords` function. This aligns with the expected behavior described in the bug report.

Issue resolved: `True`

#### ISSUE
Bug in posix implementation of django/core/files/locks.py
Description
	
The posix version of locks (the version which supports import fcntl) has a bug. The code attempts to return True to indicate success or failure acquiring a lock, but instead it always returns False. The reason is that cpython fcntl module returns None if successful, and raises an OSError to indicate failure (see â€‹https://docs.python.org/3/library/fcntl.html#fcntl.flock).
Anyone interested in using the non-blocking (i.e. locks.LOCKS_NB) requires a valid return value to know if they have successfully acquired the lock.
I believe the correct implementation should be the following:
diff --git a/django/core/files/locks.py b/django/core/files/locks.py
index c46b00b905..4938347ea7 100644

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
To analyze the problem, let's examine the provided code and the abnormal behavior. The issue lies in the `lock` and `unlock` functions in the `django/core/files/locks.py` file. The functions originally return `ret == 0`, where `ret` obtains its value from `fcntl.flock()`. According to the Python documentation, `fcntl.flock()` returns `None` on success and raises an `OSError` on failure. The current implementation always returns `False` because `None == 0` evaluates to `False`.

Steps to analyze:

1. **Initial Observation:**
   - The testing output indicates that the lock acquisition and release both return `False`.
   - The method calls to `lock` and `unlock` confirm that the root cause lies within these methods.

2. **Analyzing Expected vs. Actual:**
   - Expected: Both `lock` and `unlock` should return `True` if they succeed.
   - Actual: Both methods return `False` due to incorrect handling of the return value from `fcntl.flock()`.

Given this analysis, we can directly identify the bug and conclude:

Buggy method: `django/core/files/locks.py:lock` and `django/core/files/locks.py:unlock`

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
Since the issue and the solution have been thoroughly described, and the specific changes to make in `django/core/files/locks.py` have been provided, we can generate the patch without retrieving additional source code.

Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

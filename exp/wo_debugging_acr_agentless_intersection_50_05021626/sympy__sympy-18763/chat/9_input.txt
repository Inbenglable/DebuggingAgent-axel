Now You need to reolve the following issue in the **sympy** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Incorrect parenthesizing of Subs
Here is an example.
```python
>>> from sympy import Subs
>>> from sympy.abc import x,y
>>> 3*Subs(-x+y, (x,),(1,))
```
LaTeX printing of this gives:  
```python
'3 \\left. - x + y \\right|_{\\substack{ x=1 }}'
```

It would be better to be parenthesized to:  
```python
'3 \\left. \\left(- x + y\\right) \\right|_{\\substack{ x=1 }}'
```

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue, I need to modify the LaTeX printer for the `Subs` expression in SymPy. The method responsible for LaTeX printing is likely located within the `latex.py` file or similar, which handles LaTeX printing of various expressions, including `Subs`.

I will need to search for the method related to the LaTeX printing of `Subs`. Let's proceed to find the relevant source code.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("Subs._latex")
search_method_in_codebase("_print_Subs")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("_print_Subs")
RESULT:
#### sympy/printing/latex.py:LatexPrinter._print_Subs
```python
    def _print_Subs(self, subs):
        expr, old, new = subs.args
        latex_expr = self._print(expr)
        latex_old = (self._print(e) for e in old)
        latex_new = (self._print(e) for e in new)
        latex_subs = r'\\ '.join(
            e[0] + '=' + e[1] for e in zip(latex_old, latex_new))
        return r'\left. %s \right|_{\substack{ %s }}' % (latex_expr,
                                                         latex_subs)

```


==================================================

Your Output:
Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

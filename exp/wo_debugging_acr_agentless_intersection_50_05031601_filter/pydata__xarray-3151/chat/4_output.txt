### Review of the Patch

The patch intends to modify the `combine_by_coords` function so that it does not enforce monotonicity checks on coordinate dimensions that do not vary between datasets. The idea is to align the behavior of the function with the documentation, which states that non-varying coordinates will be ignored.

The patch logic introduces an additional condition before the monotonicity check:
- It calculates the coordinate values across datasets and checks if any coordinate dimension actually varies between datasets. 
- The monotonicity check is performed only if the coordinate dimension does vary.

### Analysis of the Test Outputs

#### Original Output
The original test output shows that a `ValueError` is raised due to non-monotonic global indexes on the 'y' dimension, as expected from the issue description.

#### Patched Output
The patched output does not correctly test the patch due to a `NameError`. This error is because the patch uses the `np` (NumPy) module without importing it, causing the function to fail before it can reach the monotonicity check logic.

### Determination of the Issue Resolution

Since the patched output results in a `NameError`, the test does not accurately confirm whether the original issue is resolved. The error indicates that there's a missing import statement for the `np` module in the patch implementation, which needs to be addressed.

Issue resolved: `False`

The `NameError` must be fixed, likely by importing NumPy (`import numpy as np`) at the beginning of the file where the patch is implemented. Once this is corrected, the test would need to be re-run to determine if the patch resolves the original issue as intended.

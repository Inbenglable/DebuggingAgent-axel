To add DISTINCT support to the `Avg` and `Sum` aggregates in Django, we'll follow the pattern used in the `Count` aggregate class by adding the `allow_distinct` attribute. This change enables the `Avg` and `Sum` classes to accept the DISTINCT parameter without throwing an exception. Here are the patches required to make this change:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):\n    function = 'AVG'\n    name = 'Avg'\n=======\nclass Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):\n    function = 'AVG'\n    name = 'Avg'\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):\n    function = 'SUM'\n    name = 'Sum'\n=======\nclass Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):\n    function = 'SUM'\n    name = 'Sum'\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

Each patch adds the `allow_distinct = True` attribute to the respective class, enabling DISTINCT support within the aggregation functions of `Avg` and `Sum`.

To address the bug, we need to check for any related constraints (unique or normal indexes) when deleting an index. If more than one constraint is found, we should identify how to manage them properly. I need to understand the context in which `_delete_composed_index` is used within the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class, and how constraints are typically handled. Let's look for any methods that deal with constraints and indexes in the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class to gain more insight before generating a patch.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor")
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "_constraint_names")
```

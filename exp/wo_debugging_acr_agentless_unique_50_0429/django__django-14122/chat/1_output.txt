To address the issue where `Meta.ordering` fields are improperly included in the `GROUP BY` clause, I need to review the relevant code that handles query generation in Django. 

I will start by examining how `Meta.ordering` interacts with the database query construction, particularly focusing on the `GROUP BY` clause. This functionality is typically implemented in Django's ORM layer. The most probable location for this code is within the query-related modules of Django's ORM, such as `django/db/models/query.py` or similar files where the query construction logic is implemented.

To proceed, I will need to search for specific methods related to query building or group by processing to understand where and how `Meta.ordering` fields are being added to the `GROUP BY` clause. Since I do not have the exact method name or file path, I'll perform a broad search for relevant query methods.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("QuerySet")
search_method_in_codebase("Query.build_with_ordering")
search_method_in_codebase("Query.build_group_by")
```

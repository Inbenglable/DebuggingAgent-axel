To resolve the issue of adding DISTINCT support for the Avg, Sum, Min, and Max aggregates in the Django project, we'll need to modify their respective class definitions to allow DISTINCT. This involves setting the `allow_distinct` attribute to `True` in each class. Here's how we can apply these changes using search/replace edits.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):\n=======\nclass Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):\n=======\nclass Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Min(Aggregate):\n=======\nclass Min(Aggregate):\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Max(Aggregate):\n=======\nclass Max(Aggregate):\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

These patches will introduce DISTINCT support to Avg, Sum, Min, and Max aggregates by setting the `allow_distinct` attribute to `True` within each class.

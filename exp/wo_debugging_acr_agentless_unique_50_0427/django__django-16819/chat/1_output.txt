To address the issue of reducing `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex` migration operations in Django, I need to explore the related migration operation classes and how they might be optimized. Generally, these operations are found in the Django ORM's migration framework.

To begin, I need to look at the existing implementations of the migration operations `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex`.

I'll start by searching for these classes within the Django codebase, as they likely contain the methods handling these operations.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("AddIndex")
search_class_in_codebase("RemoveIndex")
```

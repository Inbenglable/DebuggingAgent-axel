Since the issue is related to the `__init__` method of the `ManagementUtility` class in the `django/core/management/__init__.py` file, I need to review its source code to generate the patch. Therefore, I will search for the respective method in the specified file.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/core/management/__init__.py", "ManagementUtility")
```

To determine which of the given functions is relevant for the issue at hand, we need to refer back to the problem: the `hist()` method not respecting the `range=...` when `density=True`. Therefore, we are interested in examining the implementation of the `hist()` function, specifically within the `Axes` class, as it is closely related to how the histogram is plotted and the parameters are handled.

1. **lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py:hist**
   - This function is a wrapper around `gca().hist(...)`, where `gca()` refers to "get current axis" and it calls the `hist` method of the currently active `Axes` object.
   - This indicates that the real work, especially with respect to the handling of `range` and `density`, is likely to occur in the `Axes.hist()` implementation.

2. **lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py:Axes.hist**
   - This is the definition of the `hist()` method for the `Axes` class, which will directly handle the plotting of the histograms.
   - This implementation includes logic related to parameters such as `bins`, `range`, and `density` that could directly relate to the presented issue.

Given the above analysis, the implementation in `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py:Axes.hist` is likely the most relevant piece of code in terms of diagnosing and solving the observed behavior. The implementation in `lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py:hist` is simply a higher-level interface for the same functionality.

Therefore, the file we need is:

```
lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py:Axes.hist
```

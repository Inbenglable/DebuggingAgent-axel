The patch aims to fix the ZeroDivisionError by checking whether the number of support vectors (`n_SV`) is greater than zero. However, after the patch is applied, the test output indicates a new problem:

The patched code avoids the ZeroDivisionError but introduces a ValueError: "index pointer size (1) should be (2)." This error occurs because the `dual_coef_indptr` and `dual_coef_indices` used in constructing the sparse matrix do not have the needed size to form a valid sparse matrix when there are no support vectors.

The initial issue of a ZeroDivisionError is indeed avoided, but the patch results in a different error related to an incorrect sparse matrix format. The purpose of the patch—to prevent the ZeroDivisionError when `support_vectors_` is empty—has not been fully achieved, as it causes an alternative failure instead.

Therefore, the issue is not fully resolved with the current patch.

Issue resolved: `False`

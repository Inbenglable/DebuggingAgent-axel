To generate a patch for the identified bug within the `TypeSerializer.serialize` method, I need to examine the source code of this method. This step will allow me to understand its implementation and figure out how to modify it to include the necessary import statements correctly.

I will use the `search_method_in_file` API to retrieve the source code for `TypeSerializer.serialize`, as I know the file location from the debugging history.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/serializer.py", "TypeSerializer.serialize")
```

<ISSUE>
An index entry with parens was registered for `py:method` directive with `:property:` option
### Describe the bug

An index entry with parens was registered for `py:method` directive with `:property:` option. It should not have parens.


### How to Reproduce

```
# index.rst

.. py:method:: Foo.bar
   :property:

This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
To begin addressing the issue with the Sphinx project, it's essential to identify where the `py:method` directive with the `:property:` option causes incorrect index entries (having parens when it shouldn't). The process involves tracing where the index entries are generated or registered, particularly focusing on the `py:method` and `:property:` handling logic.

Given the provided output, we're interested in the `MethodDocumenter` and `PropertyDocumenter` classes as potential areas of focus because they handle the documenting and indexing of methods and properties.

Let's start by observing the `MethodDocumenter` class since it relates to the `py:method` directive:

Observed method: `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:MethodDocumenter.add_content`

This method often plays a role in managing the content related to documented entities and might reveal how the incorrect index entry with parentheses is being generated.
==================================================
**Analysis of Current Observed Code and Abnormal Behavior:**

The `AttributeDocumenter.add_content` method is tasked with managing the content related to attributes, but the runtime trace doesn't indicate its direct involvement with creating index entries. The observed method is part of the hierarchy that ultimately calls `Documenter.add_content`, potentially affecting subclasses like `MethodDocumenter`, `PropertyDocumenter`, and others.

From the runtime error trace, it appears that there's an unrelated issue (`AssertionError`) due to a path not existing during the runtime instrumentation using Snoop, which suggests a setup problem rather than a direct issue within the `AttributeDocumenter.add_content` method's logic itself. This error must be handled separately to enable proper tracing of the setup.

Given the objective is to resolve parens being improperly added to index entries for the property method, it's crucial to focus more directly on how `MethodDocumenter` and `PropertyDocumenter` are integrating with the indexing logic.

**Next Steps in Tracing:**

To uncover the root cause of this index entry problem, we need to observe how the indexing logic specifically processes directives marked with `:property:` and how it might mistakenly append parentheses. Thus, we should consider upstream functions where index entries are initially generated or manipulated in conjunction with property and method logic.

**Observed scope:**

I'll focus upstream within the `MethodDocumenter` class to trace the method responsible for handling index entries:

Observed scope: `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:MethodDocumenter.add_directive_header`
==================================================
**Analysis of Current Observed Code and Abnormal Behavior:**

The method `MethodDocumenter.add_directive_header` is involved with adding specific header lines to a directive representation. These headers, such as `:abstractmethod:`, `:async:`, etc., reflect the characteristics of the documented method. However, this method does not directly address the formatting of index entries (i.e., adding or removing parentheses).

In the runtime setup, there's an `AssertionError` happening unrelated to the method itself, indicating a misconfiguration in the testing setup. This assertion failure blocks the runtime instrumentation, making it difficult to trace how the method interacts with the environment specifically for indexing.

Given the context, the method itself doesn't seem responsible for index entry formatting like adding parentheses. Instead, its objective is to categorize the method with specific directive headers based on method traits.

**Next Steps in Tracing:**

To locate the issue with index entries having parentheses mistakenly appended, it's crucial to trace further upstream where index entries are composed or processed, especially regarding the `py:method` and `:property:` interactions. The association between the `MethodDocumenter` and `PropertyDocumenter` regarding index manipulation needs more investigation.

I will now focus further downstream within the `MethodDocumenter` and investigate how signatures (potentially affecting index entry formatting) are processed or manipulated:

Observed scope: `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:2134-2148`

Please provide runtime information for this scope to carry the investigation forward.

Now you choose MethodDocumenter.add_directive_header's code snippet 
  2134	    def add_directive_header(self, sig: str) -> None:
  2135	        super().add_directive_header(sig)
  2136	
  2137	        sourcename = self.get_sourcename()
  2138	        obj = self.parent.__dict__.get(self.object_name, self.object)
  2139	        if inspect.isabstractmethod(obj):
  2140	            self.add_line('   :abstractmethod:', sourcename)
  2141	        if inspect.iscoroutinefunction(obj) or inspect.isasyncgenfunction(obj):
  2142	            self.add_line('   :async:', sourcename)
  2143	        if inspect.isclassmethod(obj):
  2144	            self.add_line('   :classmethod:', sourcename)
  2145	        if inspect.isstaticmethod(obj, cls=self.parent, name=self.object_name):
  2146	            self.add_line('   :staticmethod:', sourcename)
  2147	        if self.analyzer and '.'.join(self.objpath) in self.analyzer.finals:
  2148	            self.add_line('   :final:', sourcename)

for further observation, tracing the abnormal program behavior.

This is the runtime information of the code snippet you choose to observed in MethodDocumenter.add_directive_header:

You need to trace the abnormal program behavior step by step to identify the root cause of the bug and locate the buggy method that contains the code to be fixed.
Now, please first analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior. 

Then, if you can already locate the buggy method and buggy code, reply with:  
Buggy method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Otherwise, continue tracing by selecting the next method to observe. Reply with: 
Observed method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Note that {FILE_PATH} refers to the path relative to the repository. And if you want to observe a method inside a class, please specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME.

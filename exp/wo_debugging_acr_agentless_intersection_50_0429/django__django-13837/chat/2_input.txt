## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Allow autoreloading of `python -m pkg_other_than_django runserver`
Description
	 
		(last modified by William Schwartz)
	 
​django.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments detects if Python was launched as python -m django. Currently it detects only when ​-m was passed specifically django (and only in Python environments in which __file__ is set on modules, which is ​not true of all Python environments). Like #32177, this ticket aims to remove one impediment to creating Django-based command-line utilities that have their own ​__main__ sub-module while overriding Django's built-in management commands—in this case, runserver.
The fix, which I have submitted in the ​attached PR, is to use Python's ​documented way of determining if -m was used in get_child_arguments:
The top-level __main__ module is always the entry point of a ​complete Python program.
 __main__.__spec__ is not None ​if and only if Python was launched with -m or the name of a "directory, zipfile or other sys.path entry." In the latter cases, the ​documentation says
If the script name refers to a directory or zipfile, the script name is added to the start of sys.path and the __main__.py file in that location is executed as the __main__ module.
Hence __main__.__spec__.parent (which is ​usually but not always __main__.__package__) exists and is the empty string when Python is started with the name of a directory or zip file.
Therefore Python was started with -m pkg if and only if __main__.__spec__.parent == "pkg".
Following this algorithm is guaranteed to work as long as Python obeys its own documentation, and has the side benefit of avoiding use of __file__.

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue, we need to modify the behavior of `django.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments` to correctly detect if Python was launched using `-m` with a package other than `django`. This requires retrieving the source code of the `get_child_arguments` method from the codebase to determine the current implementation and apply necessary changes.

Since we do not have the file path for `django.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments` specified, I will search for this method in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("get_child_arguments")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("get_child_arguments")
RESULT:
#### django/utils/autoreload.py:get_child_arguments
```python
def get_child_arguments():
    """
    Return the executable. This contains a workaround for Windows if the
    executable is reported to not have the .exe extension which can cause bugs
    on reloading.
    """
    import django.__main__
    django_main_path = Path(django.__main__.__file__)
    py_script = Path(sys.argv[0])

    args = [sys.executable] + ['-W%s' % o for o in sys.warnoptions]
    if py_script == django_main_path:
        # The server was started with `python -m django runserver`.
        args += ['-m', 'django']
        args += sys.argv[1:]
    elif not py_script.exists():
        # sys.argv[0] may not exist for several reasons on Windows.
        # It may exist with a .exe extension or have a -script.py suffix.
        exe_entrypoint = py_script.with_suffix('.exe')
        if exe_entrypoint.exists():
            # Should be executed directly, ignoring sys.executable.
            # TODO: Remove str() when dropping support for PY37.
            # args parameter accepts path-like on Windows from Python 3.8.
            return [str(exe_entrypoint), *sys.argv[1:]]
        script_entrypoint = py_script.with_name('%s-script.py' % py_script.name)
        if script_entrypoint.exists():
            # Should be executed as usual.
            # TODO: Remove str() when dropping support for PY37.
            # args parameter accepts path-like on Windows from Python 3.8.
            return [*args, str(script_entrypoint), *sys.argv[1:]]
        raise RuntimeError('Script %s does not exist.' % py_script)
    else:
        args += sys.argv
    return args

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

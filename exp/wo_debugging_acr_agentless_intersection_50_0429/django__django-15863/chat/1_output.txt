To resolve the issue with the `floatformat` template filter dropping precision for `Decimal` numbers, we need to examine the implementation of the `floatformat` function in Django's codebase. This will allow us to identify where the conversion to `Decimal` is happening incorrectly and modify it to handle `Decimal` numbers properly without converting them to `float`.

I need to retrieve the source code for the `floatformat` function. Since I don't know the file path for this specific method, I will search for it in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("floatformat")
```

Based on the retrieved code for the `Text` class in `lib/matplotlib/text.py` and for the `RendererAgg.draw_text` method in `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_agg.py`, I have enough context to implement the necessary changes:

1. Introduce the `_antialiased` attribute in the `Text` class to store the antialiasing state.
2. Implement `get_antialiased` and `set_antialiased` methods within the `Text` class.
3. Adjust the `RendererAgg.draw_text` method to utilize the `Text` instance's antialiased state over the global `rcParams`, if set.

I am ready to generate the patch for the issue.

Ready generation: `True`

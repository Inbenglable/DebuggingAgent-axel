The patch provided replaces the following line in the `sklearn/cluster/optics_.py` file:

Original line:
```python
min_samples = max(2, min_samples * n_samples)
```

Patched line:
```python
min_samples = int(round(max(2, min_samples * n_samples)))
```

This modification correctly addresses the issue described in the original problem statement by converting the `min_samples` variable to an integer, which resolves the `TypeError` encountered when instantiating the `NearestNeighbours` class.

Reviewing the test outputs:

### Original Output
The original output indicates a `TypeError` being raised:

```
TypeError: n_neighbors does not take <class 'float'> value, enter integer value
```

It confirms that the initial implementation allowed a float for `min_samples`, leading to an error during the execution of the test.

### Patched Output
The patched output:

```
The issue is fixed.
```

indicates that the code runs successfully without any exceptions after applying the patch, suggesting that the bug is resolved.

Based on the patch and the results seen in the test output, it appears that the issue has been fixed successfully: `min_samples` now gets converted to an integer, avoiding the error previously encountered.

Issue resolved: `True`

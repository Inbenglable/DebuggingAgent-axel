To address the issue of setting the default `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION` to `0o644` in Django's `FileSystemStorage`, I need to review how the `_save` method currently handles file permissions. Therefore, I will retrieve the source code for the `_save` method in the `FileSystemStorage` class located in `django/core/files/storage.py`.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/files/storage.py", "FileSystemStorage._save")
```

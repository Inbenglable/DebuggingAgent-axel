The API response has already provided the source code for the `kahane_simplify` function. Based on the issue description, the bug is caused because leading gamma matrices are inserted in reverse order back into the expression. This can potentially be tracked and fixed within the code section where free gamma matrix indices are "prepend" or inserted at a specific position.

I am ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

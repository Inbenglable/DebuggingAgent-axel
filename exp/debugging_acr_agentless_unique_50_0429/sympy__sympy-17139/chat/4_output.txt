Analyzing the current observed code and abnormal program behavior:

The error message `TypeError: Invalid comparison of complex I` indicates an issue with comparing complex numbers during the simplification process in Sympy. The likely root of the issue is within the `fu.py` file, particularly at line 504: `if (rv.exp < 0) == True:`, which attempts to compare a complex number `rv.exp` with an integer (0). The complex number in question is represented by `I`, the imaginary unit, and this type of direct comparison is not valid in Python.

The function `_futrig` in `trigsimp.py` helps facilitate trigonometric simplifications, but the problem stems from its interaction with functions in `fu.py`. The invalid comparison happens in a method linked through the chain of simplification functions from `simplify` to `_futrig`.

Given this understanding, the focus should be on:
1. Identifying all occurrences involving `rv.exp` comparisons, especially negative checks, as improper handling of complex numbers is leading to the error.
2. Understanding what `TR6` or `_TR56`, invoked within `_futrig`, is supposed to do and its role in inadvertently leading to these complex comparisons.
3. Reviewing how complex expressions should be handled in Sympy, particularly within trigonometric simplifications.

Based on the traceback and preliminary analysis, let's investigate further into the specific part where `rv.exp` is compared. Therefore, the scope of interest is around line 504 in `fu.py` where the invalid comparison is made.

Observed scope: `sympy/simplify/fu.py:500-506`

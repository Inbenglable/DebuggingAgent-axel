In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask
### Description

This applies to v5.3. 

It looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.

I don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.

### Expected behavior

When one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.

### How to Reproduce

This is with v5.3.   With v5.2, there are no errors.

```
>>> import numpy as np
>>> from astropy.nddata import NDDataRef

>>> array = np.array([[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]])
>>> mask = np.array([[0, 1, 64], [8, 0, 1], [2, 1, 0]])

>>> nref_nomask = NDDataRef(array)
>>> nref_mask = NDDataRef(array, mask=mask)

# multiply no mask by constant (no mask * no mask)
>>> nref_nomask.multiply(1., handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask   # returns nothing, no mask,  OK

# multiply no mask by itself (no mask * no mask)
>>> nref_nomask.multiply(nref_nomask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask # return nothing, no mask, OK

# multiply mask by constant (mask * no mask)
>>> nref_mask.multiply(1., handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask
...
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'

# multiply mask by itself (mask * mask)
>>> nref_mask.multiply(nref_mask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask
array([[ 0,  1, 64],
       [ 8,  0,  1],
       [ 2,  1,  0]])

# multiply mask by no mask (mask * no mask)
>>> nref_mask.multiply(nref_nomask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask
...
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve this issue, I need to inspect the source code of the `NDDataRef` class and the method responsible for handling arithmetic operations, especially the multiplication where mask handling logic is implemented. This will help identify why mask propagation is failing when an operand does not have a mask in version 5.3. Therefore, I will proceed to retrieve the source code for the `NDDataRef` class and investigate the relevant method responsible for the arithmetic operations.

I'll start by locating the `NDDataRef` class and then identify the method handling multiplication and mask logic.

search_class_in_codebase("NDDataRef")
search_method_in_codebase("multiply")

class NDDataRef(NDArithmeticMixin, NDIOMixin, NDSlicingMixin, NDData):
    """Implements `NDData` with all Mixins.

    This class implements a `NDData`-like container that supports reading and
    writing as implemented in the ``astropy.io.registry`` and also slicing
    (indexing) and simple arithmetic (add, subtract, divide and multiply).

    Notes
    -----
    A key distinction from `NDDataArray` is that this class does not attempt
    to provide anything that was not defined in any of the parent classes.

    See Also
    --------
    NDData
    NDArithmeticMixin
    NDSlicingMixin
    NDIOMixin

    Examples
    --------
    The mixins allow operation that are not possible with `NDData` or
    `NDDataBase`, i.e. simple arithmetic::

        >>> from astropy.nddata import NDDataRef, StdDevUncertainty
        >>> import numpy as np

        >>> data = np.ones((3,3), dtype=float)
        >>> ndd1 = NDDataRef(data, uncertainty=StdDevUncertainty(data))
        >>> ndd2 = NDDataRef(data, uncertainty=StdDevUncertainty(data))

        >>> ndd3 = ndd1.add(ndd2)

        array([[2., 2., 2.],
               [2., 2., 2.],
               [2., 2., 2.]])
        >>> ndd3.uncertainty.array  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
        array([[1.41421356, 1.41421356, 1.41421356],
               [1.41421356, 1.41421356, 1.41421356],
               [1.41421356, 1.41421356, 1.41421356]])

    see `NDArithmeticMixin` for a complete list of all supported arithmetic
    operations.

    But also slicing (indexing) is possible::

        >>> ndd4 = ndd3[1,:]
        >>> ndd4.data  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
        array([2., 2., 2.])
        >>> ndd4.uncertainty.array  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
        array([1.41421356, 1.41421356, 1.41421356])

    See `NDSlicingMixin` for a description how slicing works (which attributes)
    are sliced.

==================================================

Your Output:
To resolve the issue at hand, I need to investigate further how the `multiply` method, along with the `_prepare_then_do_arithmetic` method, handles mask propagation. Specifically, I need to understand the logic inside `_prepare_then_do_arithmetic` since the `multiply` method is essentially a wrapper that calls this function with `np.multiply`. Therefore, the key source code I need lies in the definition of `_prepare_then_do_arithmetic`.

I'll proceed to find and inspect the code of `_prepare_then_do_arithmetic`, which seems to be central to the arithmetic operations involving masks. From the snippet provided, this function should be part of the `NDArithmeticMixin` file where the `multiply` method is located.

==================================================

Your Output:
I need to inspect the implementation of the `_arithmetic` method since it is crucial for understanding how mask propagation and operations are handled during arithmetic operations in the `NDDataRef` class. The `_prepare_then_do_arithmetic` method calls `_arithmetic` to perform the main arithmetic operations, and the problem likely originates from this part of the code.

I'll proceed to retrieve the source code for `_arithmetic`, which is likely in the same file as `_prepare_then_do_arithmetic`.

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

To resolve the issue of incorrect parenthesizing of `Subs`, I need to find the method responsible for LaTeX conversion in the `Subs` class, which is likely something like `_latex`.

Since I've identified the location of the `Subs` class in `sympy/core/function.py`, I need to search for the LaTeX conversion method within this file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/core/function.py", "Subs._latex")
```

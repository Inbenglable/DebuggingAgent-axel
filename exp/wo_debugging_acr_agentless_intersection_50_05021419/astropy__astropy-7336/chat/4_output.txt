The problem in the `decorators.py` file is that it attempts to call the `to` method on the `return_` object if a return annotation is specified, without checking if the `return_` object is actually `None`. We need to modify this code to handle cases where `return_` is `None` and the return annotation is `None` as well. This will ensure that the function does not attempt to call `to` on a `NoneType` object.

Now, we have enough information to generate the patch that checks if the `return_` object is `None` and handles it appropriately. 

Ready generation: `True`

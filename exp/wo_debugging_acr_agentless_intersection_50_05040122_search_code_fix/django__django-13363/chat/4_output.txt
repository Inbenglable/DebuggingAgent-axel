I have already retrieved the source code of the `as_sql` methods for both `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` classes, and I have inspected the `TruncBase.__init__` method which handles the `tzinfo` parameter. Based on this, I can proceed to generate a patch to correctly utilize the `tzinfo` parameter in the `as_sql` methods.

Ready generation: `True`

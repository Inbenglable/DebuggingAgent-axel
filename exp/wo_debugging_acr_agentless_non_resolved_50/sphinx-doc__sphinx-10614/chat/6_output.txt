To create a patch that resolves the issue of incorrect 404 links in SVG for the inheritance diagrams, I'll modify the method responsible for generating the SVG files. The `render_dot_html` method in the `sphinx.ext.graphviz.py` file is crucial here. The aim is to correct the relative paths in the SVG object embeds. 

Here's a patch in *SEARCH/REPLACE* format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sphinx/ext/graphviz.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            self.body.append('<object data=\"%s\" type=\"image/svg+xml\" class=\"%s\">\\n' %\n                             (fname, imgcls))\n=======\n            svg_link = self.builder.get_relative_uri(node['docname'], node['filename']) + '/' + fname\n            self.body.append('<object data=\"%s\" type=\"image/svg+xml\" class=\"%s\">\\n' %\n                             (svg_link, imgcls))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### sphinx/ext/graphviz.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        fname, outfn = render_dot(self, code, options, format, prefix, filename)\n=======\n        docname = self.current_node.get('docname', '')\n        filename = self.current_node.get('filename', '')\n        fname, outfn = render_dot(self, code, options, format, prefix, filename)\n        node['docname'] = docname\n        node['filename'] = filename\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Edit 1**: This edit modifies the SVG `<object>` embedding to use the correct relative path. By computing the relative path from the document where the SVG is embedded to the path of the SVG file itself, the links become correct irrespective of the folder structure.
- **Edit 2**: This edit extends the setup to store `docname` and `filename` in the `node` object to be used later for relative URI computation. 

This should fix the issue of incorrect relative paths in the generated SVG diagrams, adhering to the structure set up by the contributing document paths and ensuring correct routing.

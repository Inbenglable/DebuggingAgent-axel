URLValidator tests failing on Python versions patched for bpo-43882
Description
	
On Python versions with a fix for â€‹bpo-43882 (i.e. 3.10.0b1 and the 3.9 git branch, not released yet) the following tests fail:

FWICS, the project is that django rejects URLs based on the split URL components. However, the bpo-43882 fix changes URL splitting behavior to strip all instances of LF, CR and tab characters before splitting, so they never reach the validator.
I'm not sure what the best fix is. One option is to reject URLs containing the forbidden characters early. Another is to go with the new recommendation and assume that LF, CR and tabs are to stripped silently.

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
import unittest
from django.core.validators import URLValidator
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

class TestURLValidator(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_validators(self):
        validator = URLValidator()
        test_values = [
            ('http://www.djangoproject.com/\n', 'LF character in URL'),
            ('http://[::ffff:192.9.5.5]\n', 'LF character in IPv6 URL')
        ]
        for value, description in test_values:
            with self.subTest(value=value, description=description):
                try:
                    validator(value)
                except ValidationError:
                    pass
                else:
                    e = AssertionError(f"ValidationError not raised for {value}")
                    print_stacktrace(e)
                    raise e

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
The main issue described is that URLValidator tests are failing on Python versions that incorporate a patch for Python bug bpo-43882. This patch alters the behavior of URL splitting by stripping certain characters (LF, CR, and tabs) before they are passed to the validator. The test failures arise because the tests expect a `ValidationError` when these characters are present, but the patch prevents these characters from reaching the validators, thus no error is raised.

In the provided test output, there are two failing cases:

1. `('http://www.djangoproject.com/\n', 'LF character in URL')`
2. `('http://[::ffff:192.9.5.5]\n', 'LF character in IPv6 URL')`

The assertion error "ValidationError not raised" occurs because the validator function does not raise a `ValidationError` for these inputs, as the offending characters are removed due to the recent changes in URL handling in newer Python versions.

The code that likely needs to be adjusted would reside in the `URLValidator` class, particularly around how input URLs are preprocessed and validated for these disallowed characters.

The module responsible for the behavior being tested is:
```python
from django.core.validators import URLValidator
```

Thus, the next logical step is to trace the behavior of the `URLValidator` to determine how it handles URLs and identify where the expected `ValidationError` is not being triggered.

Observed method: `django/core/validators.py:URLValidator`
==================================================
To analyze the current behavior of the `URLValidator`, we need to understand that the observed failure is due to the Python patch for bpo-43882, which strips certain characters (LF, CR, and tabs) before reaching the validation process.

### Observations:
1. The `URLValidator` class uses regex patterns to match and validate URLs. The failure is occurring during this validation process because the offending LF character (`'\n'`) is being stripped from the URL before it reaches this validation.
2. The `__call__` method is where the main URL validation logic is present. It checks the scheme and subsequently performs a check with the regex pattern `self.regex`.

### Analysis:
- The issue seems to be with URLs containing special characters like LF (`'\n'`), which are not causing the expected `ValidationError` due to their removal prior to regex validation.

### Existing Logic:
- The `__call__` function checks the URL scheme and validates the entire URL using a compiled regex `self.regex`.
- There are multiple places in the code where exceptions are handled to catch invalid URLs, but due to the patch, certain invalid characters are stripped before any of these checks occur.

### Resolution Strategy:
Since the characters are stripped, the patch changes the input to the method; therefore:
- To ensure these URLs raise a `ValidationError`, the code should explicitly check for disallowed characters before they reach the regex matching step.
- These checks can be added before the line where `super().__call__(value)` is invoked.

### Next Steps:
To identify the appropriate place for this check, we need to examine the initial portion of the `__call__` method where input preprocessing can occur.

Therefore, I will follow with a deeper observation of the early portion of the `__call__` method:

Observed scope: `django/core/validators.py:101-109`
==================================================
The issue at hand is related to Django's URL validation, which fails due to changes in Python's behavior that strip certain characters (LF, CR, and tabs) from URLs before they are validated. This affects the `URLValidator`'s logic, particularly in how URLs are preprocessed and validated.

### Analysis of Observed Code

In the current observed code snippet from `URLValidator.__call__`, we can see that the method checks if the input is a string type and then verifies the scheme of the URL. The scheme is extracted and checked against allowed schemes (`self.schemes`). However, there's no check for disallowed characters like LF, CR, or tabs within the method.

Since the observed failure occurs because the patch strips these characters, they do not reach this validation logic. The regex pattern that performs the validation (`self.regex`) also doesn't account for URLs that previously would have failed due to these characters.

### Abnormal Behavior

Due to Python's patch (bpo-43882), URLs with LF characters are stripped of these characters before reaching any validation code in `__call__`. Consequently, the expected `ValidationError` is not raised.

### Plan for Resolution

To fix the issue, we must ensure that the `URLValidator` checks for the presence of such characters before they are stripped, ensuring that a `ValidationError` is raised as expected.

### Next Steps

To fully understand where the validation logic should be modified, we need to delve deeper into the regular expression generation or any pre-processing logic within the `URLValidator` that addresses URL component validation.

Since the problem may not be with the initial `__call__` method itself but with the absence of checking for LF, CR, and similar characters, a likely candidate would be examining the regex-related setup or additional pre-processing logic within the class.

Therefore, the next step is to observe the method that deals with regex patterns or the setup logic for the `URLValidator`.

Observed method: `django/core/validators.py:URLValidator.__init__`
==================================================


Now you choose downstream method URLValidator.__init__ to further observe, tracing the abnormal program behavior.
This is the method code:
    96	    def __init__(self, schemes=None, **kwargs):
    97	        super().__init__(**kwargs)
    98	        if schemes is not None:
    99	            self.schemes = schemes


This is the runtime information of URLValidator.__init__:

You need to trace the abnormal program behavior step by step to identify the root cause of the bug and locate the buggy method that contains the code to be fixed.
Now, please first analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior. 

Then, if you can already locate the buggy method and buggy code, reply with:

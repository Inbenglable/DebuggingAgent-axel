To address the issue with `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension()` in the Sympy project, it's crucial to determine which pieces of code are relevant to the investigation. I need to filter the returned API content based on whether they relate directly to the function and class responsible for the bug. Looking at the API results:

1. `sympy/physics/units/quantities.py:Quantity._collect_factor_and_dimension`:
   - This content concerns a deprecated method in the `Quantity` class that redirects to the `UnitSystem` class for `_collect_factor_and_dimension`. Although deprecated, it indicates how the method operation was passed to `UnitSystem`.

2. `sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py:UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension`:
   - This content refers to the actual implementation of the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method in the `UnitSystem` class. This is essential because it contains the logic of `_collect_factor_and_dimension`, which directly influences the reported issue.

Given that the issue involves the method `_collect_factor_and_dimension()` and pertains specifically to the SI system's unit handling, the second content from `sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py` is critical. The first content might be helpful as background context regarding deprecation, but isn't necessary for resolving the immediate issue.

I will select:
```
sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py:UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension
```

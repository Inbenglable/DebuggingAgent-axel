To resolve this issue, I first need to identify the source code responsible for LaTeX printing of `Subs` expressions in the **sympy** project. This likely involves the `Subs` class and the LaTeX printing functions for it.

I need to retrieve the source code for the `Subs` class as well as the LaTeX printing functions. The LaTeX printing functionality is usually part of the `latex` module or `printing` package in Sympy.

I'll start by searching for the `Subs` class in the codebase and then identify the LaTeX printing method associated with it.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Subs")
search_method_in_codebase("latex")
```

To resolve the issue within the Django project, the code snippet `opts = cur_model._meta` found in the file `django/db/models/sql/query.py` needs to be replaced with `opts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta` to ensure compatibility with proxy models. This fix should be carefully applied to not disrupt the rest of the functionality.

Here's how the patch in SEARCH/REPLACE format would look:

```pythony
### django/db/models/sql/query.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
opts = cur_model._meta
=======
opts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's format this patch in JSON format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/sql/query.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nopts = cur_model._meta\n=======\nopts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
``` 

This patch directly replaces the problematic code snippet, addressing the crash when using `QuerySet.only()` after `select_related()` on proxy models without altering other functionalities.

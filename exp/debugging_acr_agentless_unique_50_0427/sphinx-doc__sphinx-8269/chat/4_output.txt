To address the issue, I need to understand how HTTP errors are handled in the `linkcheck` operation, specifically when `linkcheck_anchors` is set to `True`. I have found the `check_anchor` method, but I need to retrieve more context regarding its usage and how link checking is reported.

I will search for the relevant method that might be handling HTTP error reporting during the link checking process in the `linkcheck` module.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("report_issue")
search_method_in_codebase("handle_http_error")
search_method_in_file("sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py", "check_anchor")
search_class_in_codebase("AnchorCheckParser")
```

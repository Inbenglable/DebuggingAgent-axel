To resolve this issue, I need to examine the source code of the `merge` method within the `Dataset` class because that's where the problem is occurring. Additionally, I'll need to look into the `dataset_merge_method` and `merge_core` functions mentioned in the traceback. Hence, I'll retrieve the necessary source code from the `xarray` project. 

```python
search_method_in_codebase("Dataset.merge")
search_method_in_codebase("dataset_merge_method")
search_method_in_codebase("merge_core")
```

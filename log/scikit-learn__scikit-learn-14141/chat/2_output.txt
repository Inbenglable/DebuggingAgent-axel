The current observed abnormal behavior presented in the traceback is related to a missing module, `dbgsnooper`, which is unrelated to the initial issue about adding `joblib` to the `show_versions` output. As a debugging agent, our focus should be on ensuring that the `joblib` package is listed properly in the dependencies by the `show_versions` function.

The test provided suggests that the `show_versions` functionality, particularly the method `_show_versions._get_deps_info()`, is failing to include `joblib` as part of its output. To diagnose this issue further, we should first inspect the `_get_deps_info` method to confirm what information it is currently returning and why it might not be including `joblib`.

Observed method: `sklearn/utils/_show_versions.py:_get_deps_info`

The patch attempts to resolve the issue by adding support for DISTINCT in Avg and Sum aggregates via editing the Django source code to allow these operations to use the DISTINCT keyword. The code changes indicate that `allow_distinct` is set to `True` for both Avg and Sum classes in the Django codebase, which should allow these aggregates to process with DISTINCT.

Upon examination of the test output both before and after the patch was applied, the results show the same exception being raised: `django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet.` This indicates that the root cause of the failure is related to the Django app registry not being properly set up or initialized before running the test, rather than the absence of DISTINCT support in the aggregates.

In order for the code changes made in the patch to be effectively tested, the test setup needs to correctly initialize the Django application first. The issue encountered is unrelated to DISTINCT support functionality but rather pertains to Django application initialization.

Therefore, based on the output presented, the patch doesn't resolve the immediate issue of failing tests because the tests are not correctly setup, and thus don't accurately test the functionality described in the issue. 

Issue resolved: `False`

To determine whether the issue is fixed:

1. **Patch Review:**
   - The patch alters the code in the `sympy/printing/latex.py` file. Specifically, it modifies the `return` statement in the `_print_Subs` method to ensure that the `latex_expr` is enclosed in additional parentheses.
   - The altered line is changed from:  
     `return r'\\left. %s \\right|_{\\substack{ %s }}' % (latex_expr, ...)`  
     to:  
     `return r'\\left. \\left(%s\\right) \\right|_{\\substack{ %s }}' % (latex_expr, ...)`
   - This change aligns with the requirement to properly parenthesize the expression inside `Subs` in the LaTeX output.

2. **Test Output Analysis:**
   - **Original Output:** The LaTeX string generated before the patch did not contain the required parentheses around `latex_expr`, resulting in a failed assertion.
   - **Patched Output:** It seems that there is no output or error after applying the patch, which implies that the assertion does not fail. This is indicative of the generated LaTeX string matching the expected LaTeX string, suggesting that the expression is now correctly parenthesized.

Based on the analysis, the patch appropriately addresses the issue by modifying the LaTeX representation of `Subs` expressions, and the absence of any assertion failures or errors in the patched output suggests that the issue is resolved.

**Conclusion:**
Issue resolved: `True`

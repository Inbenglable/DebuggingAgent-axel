It seems there may be some misunderstanding in the naming of the methods within the `ReprPrinter` class. Let's take a step back and explore other potential methods that might handle the printing of sets and dictionaries. Commonly, in printer-related classes, each type of object has a corresponding `_print` method that dictates how it should be represented.

Considering this, let's adjust our approach to examine the likely general printing method within the `ReprPrinter` class, which might be responsible for determining the representation style for different data structures like sets or dictionaries.

Observed method: `sympy/printing/repr.py:ReprPrinter._print`

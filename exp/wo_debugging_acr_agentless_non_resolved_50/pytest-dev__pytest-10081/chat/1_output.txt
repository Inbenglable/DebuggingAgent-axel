To address the issue reported with the `pytest` project involving the `tearDown()` method for `unittest.TestCase` classes marked with `unittest.skip` being executed when running `--pdb`, I need to gather relevant source code. This will help me understand how `pytest` is handling skipped tests, particularly when they are classes.

Given the need for detailed inspection of the relevant implementation, I should begin by investigating how `pytest` processes `unittest.TestCase` classes and handles the `unittest.skip` decorator. This might involve exploring methods in `pytest` that deal with test collection, execution flow, and pdb integration.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("pytest_cmdline_main")
search_method_in_codebase("pytest_runtest_call")
search_code_in_codebase("unittest.skip")
search_code_in_codebase("--pdb")
```

These searches aim to uncover how `pytest` captures the skip signal and how pdb might alter this control flow. An investigation into `pytest_runtest_call`, a commonly used hook for running tests, and `pytest_cmdline_main`, another entry point for command-line processing, may unveil why the tearDown method is invoked despite the class being skipped.

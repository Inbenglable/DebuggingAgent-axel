To address the issue, it's essential to examine the method `evalf` in the concerned file since the error occurs there. The issue arises due to the `UnboundLocalError`, which suggests that the variable `reprec` is used before being assigned a value. To fix this, the elif clauses that define `reprec` and `imprec` need to be explored.

Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code for the `evalf` method to understand its structure and identify the specific location of the unbound variable issue. The file path related to this issue is `sympy/core/evalf.py`.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/core/evalf.py", "evalf")
```

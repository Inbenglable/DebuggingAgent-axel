To resolve the issue with `ToolLineHandles.__init__` improperly expanding the axes limits to include 0, the patch will modify the initialization to prevent setting the line positions at 0 if the axes limits do not include 0 initially. This ensures that the axes remains within the intended limits and respects the original range.

The patch should adjust the `positions` argument during initialization to take into account the existing x-limits of the axes:

```pythony
### lib/matplotlib/widgets.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        line_fun = ax.axvline if self.direction == 'horizontal' else ax.axhline
        self._line_props = line_props

        self.artists = [line_fun(p, **line_props) for p in positions]
=======
        line_fun = ax.axvline if self.direction == 'horizontal' else ax.axhline
        self._line_props = line_props

        # Adjust positions to respect the current axes limits
        if self.direction == 'horizontal':
            xmin, xmax = ax.get_xlim()
            positions = [p for p in positions if xmin <= p <= xmax]

        self.artists = [line_fun(p, **line_props) for p in positions]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The adjustment ensures that positions do not include values outside the originally set limits unless required, preserving expected axis limits. Here's the structured JSON of the search/replace patch:

```json

  "search_replace_edits": [

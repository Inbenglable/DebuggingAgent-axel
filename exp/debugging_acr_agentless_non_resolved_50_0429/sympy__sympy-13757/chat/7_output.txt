To resolve the issue, we need to ensure that the multiplication involving `Poly` objects when on the right side appropriately calls `Poly.__mul__`. Given the information we have about `Expr.__mul__` and `Mul.flatten`, I have gathered enough information to create a patch. The patch would ideally involve ensuring that the operation priority for `Poly` is respected over `Expr`.

Ready generation: `True`

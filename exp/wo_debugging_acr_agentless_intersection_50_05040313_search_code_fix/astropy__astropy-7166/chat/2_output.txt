To generate the patch for the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass to handle properties, I need to inspect the `__init__` method and any related implementation details. This will help me understand the current logic and how we can extend it to address properties.

Let's retrieve the source code for the `__init__` method of the `InheritDocstrings` class from the file `astropy/utils/misc.py`.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/utils/misc.py", "InheritDocstrings.__init__")
```

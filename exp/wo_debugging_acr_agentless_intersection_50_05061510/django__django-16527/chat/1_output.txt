To resolve the issue, I need to examine the surrounding code for the line mentioned in the issue. This will help ensure that modifying the condition to include `has_add_permission` aligns correctly with existing checks and doesn't break anything. As the issue is around the condition mentioned and it's in the file `django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py` at line 102, I need to retrieve the relevant portion of the code to apply the fix effectively.

I'll proceed with retrieving the code at that specific location first:

```python
search_code_in_file("django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py", "show_save_as_new")
```

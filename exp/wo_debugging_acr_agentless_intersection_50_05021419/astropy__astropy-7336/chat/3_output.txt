To resolve the issue with the `units.quantity_input` decorator when a return type of `None` is specified, we need to understand how the `quantity_input` decorator processes return values. Specifically, we should investigate how it attempts to handle return value unit conversions and type annotations within the `decorators.py` file.

Let's proceed by checking the specific method or part in the `astropy/units/decorators.py` file that is responsible for applying this decorator and handling the return type. Based on the error message, the likely location of the issue involves the use of `return_.to(...)`.

Therefore, I will first search for the relevant function within the `decorators.py` file where this operation is performed.

```python
search_code_in_file("astropy/units/decorators.py", "return_.to(wrapped_signature.return_annotation)")
```

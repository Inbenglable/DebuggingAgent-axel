Based on the information provided, the `sort` method seems relevant in how autodoc decides to sort and include module members based on `__all__`. To ensure that `__all__` is respected even when empty, it's necessary to review how the `sort` method interacts with the `__all__` attribute. 

Additionally, the logic in `sphinx/util/inspect.py` around returning `__all__` suggests it might be involved in filtering members. Investigating it further could provide insight into fixing the issue.

Let's gather the source code for these methods to understand their functionalities better.

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py", "sort")
search_method_in_file("sphinx/util/inspect.py", "return __all__")
```

URLValidator tests failing on Python versions patched for bpo-43882
Description
	
On Python versions with a fix for â€‹bpo-43882 (i.e. 3.10.0b1 and the 3.9 git branch, not released yet) the following tests fail:

FWICS, the project is that django rejects URLs based on the split URL components. However, the bpo-43882 fix changes URL splitting behavior to strip all instances of LF, CR and tab characters before splitting, so they never reach the validator.
I'm not sure what the best fix is. One option is to reject URLs containing the forbidden characters early. Another is to go with the new recommendation and assume that LF, CR and tabs are to stripped silently.

In the previous round, you called search APIs to retrieve relevant source code that would help identify the root cause of the issue and generate a patch. However, the code you retrieved appears in multiple locations (maybe some are irrelevant but have same key). So now your task is to determine which of the retrieved contents are indeed you need, and filter out the irrelevant ones.
This is your API invocation round output:
To address the issue with the `URLValidator`, I need to see the implementation of the `URLValidator` class or method, as well as the specific tests that are failing. This will help in deciding whether to strip characters like LF, CR, and tabs at an early stage or handle them silently.

To proceed, I'll first search for the `URLValidator` class or method to understand its current behavior and how it processes URLs. Once I have that information, I can make a decision on how to patch the issue appropriately.

Since the issue appears to be related to URL validation in Django, I'll start by searching for the `URLValidator` class in the codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("URLValidator")
search_method_in_codebase("test_validators")
```

And this is the corresponding API returned result (each content is started with #### FILE_PATH:NAME):
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("test_validators")
RESULT:
#### reproduce.py:TestURLValidator.test_validators
```python
    def test_validators(self):
        validator = URLValidator()
        test_values = [
            ('http://www.djangoproject.com/\n', 'LF character in URL'),
            ('http://[::ffff:192.9.5.5]\n', 'LF character in IPv6 URL')
        ]
        for value, description in test_values:
            with self.subTest(value=value, description=description):
                try:
                    validator(value)
                except ValidationError:
                    pass
                else:
                    e = AssertionError(f"ValidationError not raised for {value}")
                    print_stacktrace(e)
                    raise e

```

#### tests/validators/tests.py:TestValidators.test_validators
```python
    def test_validators(self):
        for validator, value, expected in TEST_DATA:
            name = validator.__name__ if isinstance(validator, types.FunctionType) else validator.__class__.__name__
            exception_expected = expected is not None and issubclass(expected, Exception)
            with self.subTest(name, value=value):
                if validator is validate_image_file_extension and not PILLOW_IS_INSTALLED:
                    self.skipTest('Pillow is required to test validate_image_file_extension.')
                if exception_expected:
                    with self.assertRaises(expected):
                        validator(value)
                else:
                    self.assertEqual(expected, validator(value))

```



Among the API returned contents, there may be some irrelevant ones or not. So now you need to analyze each returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.
Now, please first analyze the API returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.

Then you need to choose you needed ones with the following format:
```
FILE_PATH_1:NAME_1
FILE_PATH_2:NAME_2
...
```

Note:
1. The value of FILE_PATH:NAME, must consistent with the API returned content (but remove the prefix ####).
2. You may select one or more contents, or even all of them if they are indeed you need.

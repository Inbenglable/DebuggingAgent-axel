To resolve the issue, I need to examine the source code of the `floatformat()` method as it is throwing a `ValueError`. I need to locate the file where the `floatformat` function is defined and retrieve its code.

Therefore, I will use the search APIs to find and retrieve the source code of the `floatformat` method in the Django project.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("floatformat")
```

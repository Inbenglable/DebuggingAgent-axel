Change uuid field to FK does not create dependency
Description
	 
		(last modified by Simon Charette)
	 
Hi! I am new in django community, so please help me, because i really dont know is it really "bug".
I have a django project named "testproject" and two apps: testapp1, testapp2.
It will be simpler to understand, with this example:
# TestApp1(models.py):
class App1(models.Model):
	id = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, unique=True, default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False, verbose_name=_('identifier'))
	text = models.CharField(max_length=100, verbose_name=_('text'))
	another_app = models.UUIDField(null=True, blank=True, verbose_name=_('another app'))
# TestApp2(models.py):
class App2(models.Model):
	id = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, unique=True, default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False, verbose_name=_('identifier'))
	text = models.CharField(max_length=100, verbose_name=_('text'))
First model named "App1" has UUID field named "another_app":
 another_app = models.UUIDField(null=True, blank=True, verbose_name=_('another app'))
After some time i change field from UUID to FK, like this: 
another_app = models.ForeignKey(App2, null=True, blank=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, verbose_name=_('another app'))
And as result i create new migration, but Migration class was unexpected result, because it does not create any "dependencies" for App2, because of FK.
I think the correct solution will be create dependency for App2.
This project use django version 2.2 and postgresql. Attach archive with sources. Project contains small test, after running him, you will get exception like this: ValueError: Related model 'testapp2.App2' cannot be resolved.
So is it problem in django or maybe i dont understand something ?
Here is my post in django users:

This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
The current issue seems to originate from the script's failure to locate the `testproject` Django settings module. This leads to a `ModuleNotFoundError` during the Django setup.

Here are the key points observed from the log:

1. **Error Location**: The error arises when attempting to perform the Django setup using `os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'testproject.settings')`.

2. **Root Cause**: There may be a misconfiguration in the environment or project structure since it fails to find the specified settings module `testproject.settings`.

3. **Testing Issues**: The test script is designed to simulate a migration change and verify dependency creation. However, due to the absence of the settings module, it fails to complete the setup phase required for migration testing.

Given this, no specific method related to Django migrations is observed as problematic yet. The primary issue resides in the environment setup itself.

To gather further information on this issue, the next method to observe would involve verifying how the settings module is configured and imported.

Observed method: `django/__init__.py:setup`
==================================================
The runtime error we are encountering is a `ModuleNotFoundError`, indicating that the Django settings module `'testproject.settings'` cannot be found. This suggests a misconfiguration in the project's structure or environment setup rather than an issue with Django itself. The problem arises during the `django.setup()` call, specifically at line 19 in the observed `setup` method in `django/__init__.py`.

Here's the analysis based on the current observations:
1. **Setup Failure**: The error is triggered when trying to access the Django settings through `settings.LOGGING_CONFIG` inside the `setup` method because the settings module cannot be imported.
2. **Potential Causes**: The settings module not being found could be due to several reasons:
   - The `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is set incorrectly or points to a non-existent path.
   - The project directory does not include the `testproject/settings.py` file or the parent directory is not in the Python path.
   - Errors in the project structure that lead to the module being unavailable.

Given this, the primary issue seems to be related to project configuration rather than a code logic error within Django itself. However, to resolve Viktor Lomakin's migration issue, you need to ensure that the Django environment is properly configured.

Before identifying the issue with the migration system, I need to ensure the Django settings are correctly loaded. So, the next step is to observe the settings configuration further.

Observed scope: `django/conf/__init__.py:76-142`
This scope contains the settings access and initialization, where `_setup` and `Settings` are involved in handling the settings module. We need to verify if the `settings.SETTINGS_MODULE` is correctly initialized and whether the file path issues begin here.
==================================================
The trace so far indicates that the settings module `'testproject.settings'` cannot be found, which leads to a failure during the Django setup. This is termed as a `ModuleNotFoundError`, suggesting a misconfiguration in the project's structure or environment setup. The current observation has highlighted the initialization and setup of Django settings within the `Settings` class.

From the observed code snippet:

- **Issue Context**: The settings configuration code is designed to import and initialize Django settings based on the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable. The error `ModuleNotFoundError` occurs when the specified module `'testproject.settings'` cannot be located during the import attempt within the `Settings.__init__` method.

Given this information, I suspect that the problem is related to improper project configuration, such as the incorrect directory structure or Python path setting, rather than a code logic error within Django itself.

The next step is to dive deeper into the settings import process and observe the behavior during the settings module import attempt within `Settings.__init__`.

Observed method: `django/conf/__init__.py:Settings.__init__`
==================================================
Based on the current analysis, the `ModuleNotFoundError` is likely caused by the script failing to correctly locate the Django settings module `'testproject.settings'`. The primary focus should be on ensuring the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is set correctly and the project directory is structured properly.

From the `Settings.__init__` code, the settings module is attempted to be imported using `importlib.import_module(self.SETTINGS_MODULE)` at line 142. The error likely arises here due to incorrect module path or absence of a `settings.py` in the `testproject` package.

Here's what I can deduce:

- **Potential Causes**: 
  - The directory containing the `settings.py` file may not be accessible within the current Python path.
  - The environment setting `'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'` might point to a non-existent or unavailable module.
  - Improper project directory structure; ensure that `testproject` is recognized as a Python package with an `__init__.py` if necessary.

To address this, it's crucial to verify the structure of the `testproject` directory and ensure the settings module path is valid. If solving this allows the script to proceed further without the `ModuleNotFoundError`, it should help in properly carrying out the migration dependency checks.

Since there's no buggy method identified yet, I will focus on the import statement logic.

**Next steps**:
Observed scope: `django/conf/__init__.py:142-143`

This scope covers the critical import operation which triggers the error. Observing the behavior around this will help verify the import process for `testproject.settings`.
==================================================
From the current observations, the `ModuleNotFoundError` is caused by the script failing to locate the Django settings module `'testproject.settings'`. This error arises during the import process within `Settings.__init__` where `importlib.import_module(self.SETTINGS_MODULE)` attempts to import the specified settings module.

**Analysis:**
- **Error Context**: The module `'testproject.settings'` is not found, which suggests there may be a problem with the path configuration or the structure of the project directory.
- **Potential Causes**: 
  - The `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable is incorrectly set or points to a non-existent module.
  - The project directory does not contain the expected `settings.py` file within the `testproject` package.
  - Improper project directory structure—possibly `'testproject'` needs to be a recognized Python package with `__init__.py`.

Given the error is occurring due to a missing module, the primary issue seems to be related to project setup rather than Django's code logic itself.

Considering this, there isn't a specific buggy method within Django identified yet. Instead, the issue resides in setting up the environment correctly.

**Next Step:**

To proceed further in debugging, I'll verify the method responsible for loading the migrations, as that is the next logical step post-environment setup and could relate directly to the migration dependency behavior discussed in the issue.

Observed method: `django/db/migrations/loader.py:MigrationLoader.load_disk`
==================================================

To resolve the issue and generate a patch, I need to retrieve the source code for the `_check_list_display_item` method within the `ModelAdminChecks` class located in the `django/contrib/admin/checks.py` file. This will allow me to understand the current implementation and modify it appropriately.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/admin/checks.py", "ModelAdminChecks._check_list_display_item")
```

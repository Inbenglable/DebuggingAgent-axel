The issue is with the `floatformat` method in Django, which crashes when processing the string '0.00' or Decimal '0.00'. To resolve this issue, I need to examine the implementation of the `floatformat` function in the Django codebase. 

I don't have the file path of the `floatformat` method directly available, so I need to search for it in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("floatformat")
```

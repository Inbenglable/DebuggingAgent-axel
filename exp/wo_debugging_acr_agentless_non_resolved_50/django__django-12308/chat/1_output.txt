To address the issue, we need to focus on the `display_for_field` method within Django's admin utilities as well as understand how `JSONField` works in Django. The description suggests that the `prepare_value` method of `JSONField` might need to be invoked.

First, we need to check the source code for the `display_for_field` method to understand its current implementation. Then, we need to locate the `prepare_value` method of the `JSONField` to understand how it processes JSON data.

Let's start by retrieving the source code for `display_for_field`. As we are working with Django's admin utilities, this method should likely be in the `django/contrib/admin/utils.py` file, if following Django's typical structure.

Next, we need to locate the `JSONField` class and its `prepare_value` method. Assuming this class may be in Django's database models fields package, I'll search for `JSONField` only in the codebase since I might not know the exact file path without more context.

I'll proceed with the searches now.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/admin/utils.py", "display_for_field")
search_class_in_codebase("JSONField")
search_method_in_codebase("JSONField.prepare_value")
```

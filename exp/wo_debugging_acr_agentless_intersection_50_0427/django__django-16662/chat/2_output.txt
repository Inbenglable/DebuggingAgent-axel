To address the issue with import ordering in Django migration files, I need to analyze the code responsible for generating these migration files. The class `MigrationAutodetector` seems relevant as it might be involved in determining the changes that need to be written into the migration files. However, it doesn't seem to have methods explicitly accountable for writing or generating the actual migration files.

The critical piece of code is likely in the file or module responsible for writing the generated changes into a migration file. 

I will need to search for methods like `write_migration_file` or similar, which might be responsible for writing the migration files. Let's first find the method related to file writing or generation in the `MigrationAutodetector` file.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("write_migration_file")
search_method_in_codebase("generate_migration_file")
```

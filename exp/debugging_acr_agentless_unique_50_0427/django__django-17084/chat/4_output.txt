The ImportError stated in the output indicates that there is an attempt to import `Window` from `django.db.models.functions`, which fails because `Window` is not located in that module. Instead, `Window` functions are part of `django.db.models`, not `django.db.models.functions`.

Given this analysis, the problem lies in an incorrect import statement trying to import `Window` from the wrong module.

Buggy method: `reproduce.py:<module>`

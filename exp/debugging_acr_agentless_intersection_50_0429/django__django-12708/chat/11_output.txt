The patch modifies the logic in the `_delete_composed_index` function to better separate and handle constraints corresponding to `unique_together` and `index_together`. The intention is to more accurately filter constraint names so that the correct constraint is identified and removed without conflict.

However, upon reviewing the test output before and after the patch:

### Original Output:
1. The `migrate` command for removing the `index_together` fails with a `ValueError` indicating the presence of two constraints when attempting to delete an index.

### Patched Output:
1. The same `ValueError` occurs with the patched logic. The error message remains unchanged, indicating that two constraints are still found when trying to remove the index:

   ```
   ValueError: Found wrong number (2) of constraints for test_app_testmodel(field1, field2)
   ```

This confirms that the patch does not successfully resolve the issue as the behavior and error message have not changed after applying the patch.

Issue resolved: `False`

To address the issue, I need to retrieve the source code of the `filter_members` method from the `Documenter` class in the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file. This will provide the necessary context to implement support for specifying specific private members in the `:private-members:` directive. Since I have determined the file path and method name, I will proceed to invoke the appropriate API to retrieve the source code.

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py", "Documenter.filter_members")
```

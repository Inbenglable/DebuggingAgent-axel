To resolve the issue with `ModelChoiceField` not providing the value of the invalid choice when raising a `ValidationError`, I need to inspect the implementation of the `ModelChoiceField` class to understand how the error message is constructed and modify it to include the invalid value. Based on the explanation given, the class should be located in the Django codebase. 

I will start by retrieving the source code for the `ModelChoiceField` class, as modifications will need to be made there.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ModelChoiceField")
```

From the provided information, the patch is intended to address the issue of small decimals being incorrectly formatted in exponential notation when using `django.utils.numberformat.format`. The patch focuses on two main changes:

1. It conditions the usage of scientific notation by checking if `decimal_pos` is `None`, aiming to respect the decimal position specification over scientific notation for small values.
2. It alters the formatting approach to adhere to the provided `decimal_pos`, defaulting to a typical precision level when `decimal_pos` is `None`.

Despite these changes, the output before and after the patch indicates a configuration error related to Django settings (`django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured`). This error is not directly associated with the formatting logic captured in the issue but rather with the testing environment lacking the necessary Django settings configuration (`DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`). This suggests that the test environment wasn't correctly set up to evaluate the functionality change.

Since the test results before and after applying the patch are identical, and both are blocked by an environmental setup issue, it's impossible to determine if the patch resolves the original issue because the test doesn't verify the formatting functionality due to the configuration error.

Therefore, based on the provided analysis of test outputs, the resolution of the issue itself remains unassessed in this context because the actual logic wasn't tested. 

Issue resolved: `False`

Based on the issue details, the problem seems to be occurring within the `django.db.models.lookups:resolve_lookup_value` method, causing lists to be coerced into tuples. To address this bug, I'll need to review this method's implementation to identify and rectify the coercion behavior.

Therefore, I need to search for the `resolve_lookup_value` method in the Django codebase to gather its source code before proceeding with the patch generation.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("resolve_lookup_value")
```

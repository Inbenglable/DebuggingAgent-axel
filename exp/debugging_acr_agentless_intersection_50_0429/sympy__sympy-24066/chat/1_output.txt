To diagnose the issue, let's summarize the abnormal behavior encountered:

The test attempts to validate that the expression involving units (specifically, `exp(second/(farad*ohm))`) is dimensionless. The issue arises from an incorrect detection of the dimension, leading to a `ValueError`. This indicates that the current logic in the code is not handling the dimension detection properly for certain types of expressions involving exponential functions.

The `ValueError` occurs in the `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension()` method in the `/sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py` file, specifically at line 179. The error message mentions that the dimension was expected to be `Dimension(1)` but was incorrectly identified as `Dimension(time/(capacitance*impedance))`.

To further trace the problem, examine the relevant observed method where this logic is applied:

Observed method: `sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py:UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension`

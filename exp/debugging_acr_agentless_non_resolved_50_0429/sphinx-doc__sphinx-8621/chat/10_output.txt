Based on the task and the information provided, the issue is related to how the `:kbd:` role in Sphinx processes certain characters (`-`, `+`, `^`) when generating HTML. The role is incorrectly treating these characters as separators rather than actual keystrokes in some cases, leading to malformed HTML output.

From the tracing information, it's clear that the examination of the `Index.run` method is not connected to the problem with the `:kbd:` role, as this method deals with a deprecated index role.

The logical next step is to accurately locate and inspect the `KbdRole.run` method, where the `:kbd:` role's behavior is defined and processed. This method should contain the logic for handling the parsing and HTML generation of the `:kbd:` role input. Correcting or refining this logic should address the issue of incorrect HTML outputs.

To effectively address the issue and identify the root cause:
1. Identify the method in `sphinx/roles.py` where the `:kbd:` role processing and HTML conversion is occurring.
2. Investigate how the role distinguishes between actual keystrokes and separators, especially concerning the characters `-`, `+`, and `^`.

Let's proceed by observing the `run` method for the `KbdRole`, as it should handle specific processing logic for `:kbd:` roles.

Observed scope: `sphinx/roles.py:KbdRole.run`

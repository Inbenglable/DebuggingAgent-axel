To resolve the IndexError issue, I will make the following modifications to ensure that the `minimal_blocks` method correctly handles lists when elements need to be deleted. This will include iterating through indices in descending order when modifying lists to avoid skipping elements due to re-indexing after deletion:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/combinatorics/perm_groups.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                for i, r in enumerate(rep_blocks):\n=======\n                for i, r in enumerate(rep_blocks[::-1]):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### sympy/combinatorics/perm_groups.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                    del num_blocks[i], blocks[i]\n=======\n                    num_blocks.pop(i), blocks.pop(i)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

These edits ensure that elements are removed correctly without triggering IndexError, which is caused when elements are removed from a list while iterating through it, modifying its size and indices. By iterating in reverse order (descending) and using safe deletion methods (`pop`), we prevent index re-calibration issues and maintain consistent behavior.

To determine if the issue is resolved, let's analyze the changes introduced by the patch, as well as the test output before and after applying the patch.

### Patch Analysis

The patch modifies the `SpanSelector` widget's initialization in such a way that it checks the current axis limits and adjusts the positions of the lines accordingly. If the `direction` is `'horizontal'`, it restricts the `positions` to the current x-axis limits (`xmin` to `xmax`). By filtering out positions that fall outside these limits, the patch ensures that the axes limits are not forcefully expanded to include values like 0, preserving the original axis limits set before the interactive selection.

### Test Output Before the Patch

Before applying the patch, the test outputs an `AssertionError`, indicating that the initial x-axis limits `(9.5, 20.5)` do not match the final x-axis limits `(-1.0000000000000009, 21.0)`. This confirms the described issue of the axis limits being incorrectly expanded.

### Test Output After the Patch

After applying the patch, the test produces no output or errors. This indicates that the assertion—checking the equality of initial and final x-axis limits—now passes successfully. The absence of errors or assertion failures means that the test has verified the x-axis limits remain unchanged, as desired.

### Conclusion

Given the patch correctly modifies the `SpanSelector` behavior to keep the axis limits unaltered (by restricting line positions to the current range), and the test results confirm that the previous erroneous behavior no longer occurs, the issue is resolved with the applied changes.

Issue resolved: `True`

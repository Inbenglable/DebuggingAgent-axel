To resolve this issue, I need to retrieve the source code for the `hexbin` method (presumably part of the `Axes` class) that is handling the `mincnt` and `C` parameters. This will help in understanding how these parameters are processed, and particularly how the condition for including grid points is implemented.

Let's start by searching for the `Axes.hexbin` method in the `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py` file, as indicated in the issue description.

```python
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py", "Axes.hexbin")
```

To resolve the issue, we need to ensure that the division operation safely handles cases where `n_SV` (the number of support vectors) is zero. In such cases, the logic should avoid division by zero and correctly assign an empty sparse matrix to `self.dual_coef_`. Here's the patch that addresses this:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sklearn/svm/base.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        dual_coef_indices = np.tile(np.arange(n_SV), n_class)\n        dual_coef_indptr = np.arange(0, dual_coef_indices.size + 1,\n                                     dual_coef_indices.size / n_class)\n        self.dual_coef_ = sp.csr_matrix(\n            (dual_coef_data, dual_coef_indices, dual_coef_indptr),\n            (n_class, n_SV))\n=======\n        if n_SV == 0:\n            self.dual_coef_ = sp.csr_matrix((n_class, 0))\n        else:\n            dual_coef_indices = np.tile(np.arange(n_SV), n_class)\n            dual_coef_indptr = np.arange(0, dual_coef_indices.size + 1,\n                                         dual_coef_indices.size / n_class)\n            self.dual_coef_ = sp.csr_matrix(\n                (dual_coef_data, dual_coef_indices, dual_coef_indptr),\n                (n_class, n_SV))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch checks if `n_SV` is zero before performing the division operation. If it is zero, it directly configures `self.dual_coef_` as an empty sparse matrix with the correct shape, thereby preventing a `ZeroDivisionError`.

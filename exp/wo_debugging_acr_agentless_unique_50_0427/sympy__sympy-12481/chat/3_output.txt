To address the issue with handling non-disjoint cycles in the `Permutation` constructor, I've reviewed the `__new__` method of the `Permutation` class. The implementation checks if the cycles are valid and throws a `ValueError` when duplicate elements are found within the cycle representation. This behavior needs to be adjusted to allow non-disjoint cycles.

Given the information retrieved, I am ready to generate the patch to modify the behavior for non-disjoint cycles by using a left-to-right application of the cycles to construct the permutation. 

Ready generation: `True`

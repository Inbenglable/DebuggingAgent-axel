The current observed code and abnormal program behavior indicate that the issue arises when the `min_samples` parameter is passed as a float instead of an integer to the `OPTICS` class. This float value is not converted to an integer before being used to instantiate the `NearestNeighbors` class, which expects an integer value for `n_neighbors`.

From the traceback, it's evident that the problematic code lies in the `fit` method within the `OPTICS` class in the `optics_.py` file. During the execution of this method, specifically at line 248, the `compute_optics_graph` function is called, which subsequently tries to create an instance of `NearestNeighbors` with a float `min_samples` value, leading to the `TypeError`.

Buggy method: `sklearn/cluster/optics_.py:OPTICS.fit`

Here is the solution implementation needed to resolve the identified issue:

1. Modify the assignment in the `sklearn/cluster/optics_.py` file to ensure that the `min_samples` parameter is converted to an integer when necessary, right before being used by `NearestNeighbors`.

Let's proceed with the fix and submit the pull request.

To resolve the issue reported with the `floatformat()` function in Django crashing on "0.00", I need to first examine the source code of the `floatformat` function. I need to understand how this function processes the input and where it might be raising a `ValueError`. Therefore, I should search for the `floatformat` method in the Django project codebase. 

Since the file path is not provided, I'll search for the method in the entire codebase to locate its source file.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("floatformat")
```

To address the issue, I need to examine the current implementation of the `_check_list_display_item` method from the Django project, specifically within the admin checks module. This method needs to be inspected to understand its existing logic before implementing the suggested corrections.

I'll perform a search to retrieve the method's source code.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("_check_list_display_item")
```

To address this issue, I need to examine the `use_required_attribute` methods in both `ClearableFileInput` and `FileInput` classes to understand how they currently operate. This will guide the decision of how to move or modify the method according to the issue's requirement.

I'll begin by searching for the `use_required_attribute` method in the `django/forms/widgets.py` file, as it is the file mentioned in the issue for `ClearableFileInput`, and also ensures we find the method in `FileInput`.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute")
search_method_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "FileInput.use_required_attribute")
```

To determine whether the issue has been resolved, let's review the provided patch and analyze the test outputs before and after applying the patch.

### Patch Review
The patch involves modifying the `django/db/models/aggregates.py` file to add `allow_distinct = True` to the `Avg` and `Sum` aggregate classes. This aligns with the issue description which requires adding `DISTINCT` support for these aggregates.

### Test Output Analysis
1. **Original Output**: The tests fail with the error `django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet.` This indicates that Django settings and models are not correctly configured and initialized for testing, which prevents the tests from running at all.

2. **Patched Output**: After applying the patch, the test results remain unchanged, showing the same `AppRegistryNotReady` error. This suggests that the patch did not affect the error that occurs due to incorrect or uninitialized app configurations.

### Conclusion
The issue reported is about adding support for `DISTINCT` in the `Avg` and `Sum` aggregates. However, the test errors are related to Django's application readiness and not directly tied to the functionality of the aggregates themselves. The test errors would need to be resolved by correctly initializing the Django environment, which is beyond the scope of the patch.

Since the patch does not address the root cause of the test failures and we cannot verify the functionality changes due to these errors, the determination of the issue being resolved cannot be made solely based on the outputs provided.

Issue resolved: `False`

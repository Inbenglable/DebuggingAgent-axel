To address the identified issue in the `pylint` project, I need to examine the `_query_cpu()` function from the `pylint.lint.run` module to understand how it determines the number of CPUs and ensure that it doesn't return zero. I will retrieve the source code of this method to gain a deeper understanding.

```python
search_method_in_file("pylint/lint/run.py", "_query_cpu")
```

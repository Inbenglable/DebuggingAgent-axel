## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Argument expected for short verbose option
### Bug description

The short option of the `verbose` option expects an argument.
Also, the help message for the `verbose` option suggests a value `VERBOSE` should be provided.

The long option works ok & doesn't expect an argument:
`pylint mytest.py --verbose`


### Command used

```shell
pylint mytest.py -v
```


### Pylint output

```shell
usage: pylint [options]
pylint: error: argument --verbose/-v: expected one argument
```

### Expected behavior

Similar behaviour to the long option.

### Pylint version

```shell
pylint 2.14.0-dev0
astroid 2.11.2
Python 3.10.0b2 (v3.10.0b2:317314165a, May 31 2021, 10:02:22) [Clang 12.0.5 (clang-1205.0.22.9)]

In the previous round, you called search APIs to retrieve relevant source code that would help identify the root cause of the issue and generate a patch. However, the code you retrieved appears in multiple locations (maybe some are irrelevant but have same key). So now your task is to determine which of the retrieved contents are indeed you need, and filter out the irrelevant ones.
This is your API invocation round output:
To resolve the issue described, I need to examine the code related to the argument parsing for the `verbose` option. Typically, this code would be part of a script or file where the command-line interface for Pylint is defined. I will start by searching for methods related to argument parsing or option setting within the Pylint project codebase.

Since I don't have the specific file path of the method dealing with command-line options, I will search for relevant methods in the codebase. This could involve methods like `parse_args`, `add_argument`, or similar.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("add_argument")
search_method_in_codebase("parse_args")
search_code_in_codebase("--verbose")
search_code_in_codebase("-v")
```

And this is the corresponding API returned result (each content is started with #### FILE_PATH:NAME):
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_code_in_codebase("--verbose")

    "--enable-all-extensions": (False, _enable_all_extensions),
}

```



Among the API returned contents, there may be some irrelevant ones or not. So now you need to analyze each returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.
Now, please first analyze the API returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.

Then you need to choose you needed ones with the following format:
```
FILE_PATH_1:NAME_1
FILE_PATH_2:NAME_2
...
```

Note:
1. The value of FILE_PATH:NAME, must consistent with the API returned content (but remove the prefix ####).
2. You may select one or more contents, or even all of them if they are indeed you need.

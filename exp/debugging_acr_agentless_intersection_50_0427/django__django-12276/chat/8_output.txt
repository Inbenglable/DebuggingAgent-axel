To fix the issue of the 'required' attribute being improperly added when initial data exists for a `FileInput`, I need to implement a `use_required_attribute` method in the `FileInput` class, similar to its functionality in the `ClearableFileInput` class. I will retrieve the source code of the `ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute` method to understand its implementation and appropriately adapt it for the `FileInput` class.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute")
```

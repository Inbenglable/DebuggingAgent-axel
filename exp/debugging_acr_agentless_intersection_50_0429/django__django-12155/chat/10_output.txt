To resolve the identified issue with the `trim_docstring` function in `django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py`, we'll be modifying the code where the indentation is calculated. The fix involves skipping the first line when calculating the indentation. Here's the detailed search and replace edit:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())\n=======\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This edit changes the way indentation is calculated by only considering lines from the second line onwards, avoiding the error when the first line has text, which resolves the issue described.

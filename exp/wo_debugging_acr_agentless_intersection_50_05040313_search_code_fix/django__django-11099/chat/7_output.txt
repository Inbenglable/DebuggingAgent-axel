To determine whether the issue is fixed, let's review the provided information:

1. **Issue Summary**: The `UsernameValidator` in Django was allowing trailing newline characters in usernames due to the use of the `$` regex anchor, which matches end-of-string or before a newline at the end. The proposed solution suggests replacing `^` and `$` anchors with `\A` and `\Z` to strictly denote the start and the end of the string.

2. **Patch Context**: The patch changes the regular expressions in `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` to use `\A` and `\Z` rather than `^` and `$`.

3. **Original Test Output**: Before applying the patch, the test output indicates the validators did not raise errors for usernames ending with a newline. Consequently, assertions in the test failed because no exception was raised as expected.

4. **Patched Test Output**: After applying the patch, the test code now correctly raises a `ValidationError` when a username with a trailing newline is validated, suggesting the issue with allowing trailing newlines has been addressed. However, the output also includes a `django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured` error, which is unrelated to the original issue. This error is indicated due to missing Django settings configuration in the test environment and does not affect the functionality being tested regarding the newline acceptance.

Therefore, despite the additional configuration error, the change in behavior of the validator (now raising a `ValidationError` as expected upon encountering a newline) does indeed resolve the initially described issue.

Issue resolved: `True`

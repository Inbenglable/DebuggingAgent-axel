The patch modifies the `merge_attrs` function in `xarray/core/merge.py` to address the problem where attributes were being referenced instead of copied when `combine_attrs='override'`. The change from `return variable_attrs[0]` to `return dict(variable_attrs[0])` ensures that a new dictionary is created, thus eliminating the reference issue. This should prevent changes to the attributes of the merged dataset from affecting the original datasets.

1. **Review of the Test Output:**

   - **Original Output:** 
     - The test failed with an `AssertionError` indicating that the attribute `a` in `xds1` was changed unexpectedly after the merge operation.

   - **Patched Output:**
     - The output after applying the patch is empty, indicating that no exceptions were raised, and the `assert` statement passed successfully. This suggests that the bug, where the attribute in the original dataset changed unexpectedly, has been resolved.

2. **Conclusion:**

   The patch effectively addresses the issue by ensuring that attributes are copied rather than referenced. The fact that the patched test output is empty confirms that the test case no longer triggers the unexpected attribute change error.

Issue resolved: `True`

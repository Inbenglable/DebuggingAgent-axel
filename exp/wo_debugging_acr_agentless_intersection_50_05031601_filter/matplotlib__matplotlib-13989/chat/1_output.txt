To address the issue of the `hist` function not respecting the `range` parameter when `density=True`, we need to review the source code of the `hist` method in Matplotlib. This will help us understand how the `range` and `density` arguments are currently being used together, and subsequently identify the exact location and nature of the bug causing this behavior. 

I will proceed to search for the `hist` method source code in the Matplotlib codebase, as its analysis is crucial for generating a patch.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("hist")
```

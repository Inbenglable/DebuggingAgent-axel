To evaluate whether the issue is resolved, let's go through the patch and the test outputs step by step.

### Patch Review
The patch modifies the `get_index_text` function in the `sphinx/domains/python.py` to differentiate between `py:method` directives and `property` options. Specifically, it changes the behavior such that if the `:property:` option is specified, the index entry format adapts appropriately by altering how attributes and classes are displayed (to remove parentheses for property entries).

### Test Output Analysis

#### Original Output
In the original test output, the system builds the documentation successfully, but it raises an `AssertionError` because the index entry for `Foo.bar` was not foundâ€”indicating that `Foo.bar` was missing from the index entirely.

#### Patched Output
The patched output is identical to the original one. It shows that the Sphinx documentation builds correctly, but still raises an `AssertionError` for the same reason as before: "Index entry for 'Foo.bar' not found."

### Conclusion

Both before and after applying the patch, the issue persists since the test fails due to `Foo.bar` not appearing in the index, which is unrelated to the formatting of the entry (i.e., parentheses). This suggests that the patch does not address the root cause of the index entry not being created. Thus, the issue is not resolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

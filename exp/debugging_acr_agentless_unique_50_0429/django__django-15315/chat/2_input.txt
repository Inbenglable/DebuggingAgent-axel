You need to trace the abnormal program to resolve project issues and submit pull requests.
Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Model Field.__hash__() should be immutable.
Description
	
Field.__hash__ changes value when a field is assigned to a model class.
This code crashes with an AssertionError:
from django.db import models
f = models.CharField(max_length=200)
d = {f: 1}
class Book(models.Model):
	title = f
assert f in d
The bug was introduced in #31750.
It's unlikely to have been encountered because there are few use cases to put a field in a dict *before* it's assigned to a model class. But I found a reason to do so whilst implementing #26472 and the behaviour had me stumped for a little.
IMO we can revert the __hash__ change from #31750. Objects with the same hash are still checked for equality, which was fixed in that ticket. But it's bad if an object's hash changes, since it breaks its use in dicts.

</ISSUE>


Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
from django.db import models
import traceback
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    f = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    d = {f: 1}
    class Book(models.Model):
        title = f
    try:
        assert f in d
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

This is the corresponding output and runtime information:

You need to trace the abnormal program behavior step by step to identify the root cause of the bug and locate the buggy method that contains the code to be fixed.
Now, please first analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior. 

Then, if you can already locate the buggy method and buggy code, reply with:
Buggy method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Otherwise, continue tracing by selecting the next method to observe. Reply with: 
Observed method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Note that {FILE_PATH} refers to the path relative to the repository. And if you want to observe a method inside a class, please specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME.

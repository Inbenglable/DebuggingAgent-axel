To generate the patch, I need to look into the `_arithmetic` method that is invoked within the `_prepare_then_do_arithmetic` function. This method seems to be responsible for the actual arithmetic operation and likely involves mask handling.

I will search for `_arithmetic` method in the `astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py` file to understand the details of the arithmetic operation and how it handles masks.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py", "_arithmetic")
```

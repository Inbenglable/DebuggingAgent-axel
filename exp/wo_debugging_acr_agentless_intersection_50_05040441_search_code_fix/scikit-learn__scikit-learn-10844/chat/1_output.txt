To address the issue, I need to identify the specific method in the `scikit-learn` codebase where the proposed fix should be applied. The problem originates from the line of code located in `sklearn/metrics/cluster/supervised.py`, specifically around line 859. The method has not been named in the provided issue description, so I will first search for and retrieve the relevant method source code from this file to ensure the correct context for modification.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/metrics/cluster/supervised.py", "")
```

## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
FileInput shouldn't display required attribute when initial data exists.
Description
	 
		(last modified by thenewguy)
	 
I think that ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute() (â€‹https://github.com/django/django/blob/e703b93a656b78b9b444bb3a9980e305ed002a70/django/forms/widgets.py#L454) should be moved to FileInput.use_required_attribute() so that required is not output on the html input element that represents FileInput when a file is already set (e.g. already saved on a model instance that is being edited).
Maybe I am overlooking a use case where this is not desirable? I can not think of one.

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve this issue, I need to examine the current implementation of the `use_required_attribute` method in both the `ClearableFileInput` and `FileInput` classes. This will help me understand the existing logic and ensure that any modifications follow the intended design while maintaining functionality.

First, I'll locate and review the `use_required_attribute` method in the `ClearableFileInput` class, which is likely located in the `django/forms/widgets.py` file as hinted by the issue description. Afterward, I will check for the `FileInput` class implementation to see where this method resides and how it can be adjusted. 

Let's search for these methods in the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute")
search_method_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "FileInput.use_required_attribute")
search_class_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "FileInput")
```

        return False

        ...

    def value_omitted_from_data(self, data, files, name):
        ...
```


==================================================

Your Output:
To address the issue, it appears that I need to adjust the `use_required_attribute` method so that it doesn't render the `required` attribute when there's initial data. The method `use_required_attribute` for `ClearableFileInput` currently checks for initial data correctly, but this logic needs to be applied in the `FileInput` class as well.

The `FileInput` class doesn't currently have a `use_required_attribute` method implemented, so I will need to add one. I have identified where this method should be integrated but have not yet retrieved the full code implementation of the `ClearableFileInput` class, which can provide useful insights into implementing the logic.

Let's retrieve the class details for `ClearableFileInput` to ensure that the new method aligns with how this class manages its behavior, especially any relevant inheritance or default behavior.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "ClearableFileInput")
```

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

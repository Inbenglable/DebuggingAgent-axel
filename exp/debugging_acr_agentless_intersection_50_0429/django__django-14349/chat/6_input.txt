URLValidator tests failing on Python versions patched for bpo-43882
Description
	
On Python versions with a fix for â€‹bpo-43882 (i.e. 3.10.0b1 and the 3.9 git branch, not released yet) the following tests fail:

FWICS, the project is that django rejects URLs based on the split URL components. However, the bpo-43882 fix changes URL splitting behavior to strip all instances of LF, CR and tab characters before splitting, so they never reach the validator.
I'm not sure what the best fix is. One option is to reject URLs containing the forbidden characters early. Another is to go with the new recommendation and assume that LF, CR and tabs are to stripped silently.

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
The observed abnormal behavior in the test results is the failure of URL validation when using Python versions that have been patched for bpo-43882. The patch alters URL splitting by stripping newline, carriage return, and tab characters before splitting, which prevents these characters from reaching the URL validator in Django. As a result, the URLValidator does not raise a `ValidationError` when encountering URLs containing these forbidden characters, leading to the test failures described.

The abnormal behavior occurs within the tests executed by `TestURLValidator.test_validators`. The root cause seems to be related to the handling of URL components and how URLValidator processes input values before validation checks.

Considering the information provided, including the specific test failures and the Python bug change, the method `URLValidator.__call__` in `django.core.validators` appears to be responsible for the URL validation process.

To identify the buggy piece of code, we need to observe how `URLValidator` processes the input URL values and see where the stripping behavior affects validation.

Observed method: `django/core/validators.py:URLValidator.__call__`
==================================================
The issue arises because the handling of LF, CR, and tab characters has changed because of a Python patch (bpo-43882). These characters are stripped before the URL components are split, leading to them not reaching the `URLValidator` to raise a `ValidationError`. In the current version of `URLValidator.__call__`, the validation process starts by checking the validity of the scheme but does not reject or handle forbidden characters like LF, CR, and tab early in the validation process.

To help me identify where this process might need adjustment, let's dive deeper into how the method processes the URL after the scheme check and into the point of validation that uses `urlsplit`.

Observed scope: `django/core/validators.py:116-142`
==================================================
Based on the provided trace and current observations, the issue is occurring in the `URLValidator.__call__` method due to changes in character handling brought about by the Python patch bpo-43882. Specifically, the failure to raise a `ValidationError` for URLs containing the LF character is related to those characters being stripped before they reach certain validation checks, which wasn't accounted for in this method's existing logic.

Analyzing the observed code snippet from `URLValidator.__call__`, the issue likely lies in how it processes input URLs post-scheme verification. The URL components are extracted using `urlsplit`, which is where characters like LF are removed. The validator doesn't currently incorporate a check to reject such characters early in the validation process.

Given this understanding, the most suitable resolution would involve introducing a preliminary step to detect and reject URLs with forbidden characters (LF, CR, or tabs) before undergoing further processing. This might entail adding logic to reject such invalid URLs prior to the `urlsplit` call on line 116.

With this analysis, the next step would be to decide if any additional observation is necessary or if a fix can be directly applied. However, considering the diagnostic information accumulated so far, it's possible to narrow down on the existing code location responsible for the bug.

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To address this issue, I need to examine the source code of the `URLValidator.__call__` method in the `django/core/validators.py` file. By inspecting this method, I can determine how to introduce a preliminary step to reject URLs containing forbidden characters (LF, CR, or tabs) before further processing. Since I need the complete code context of this method to craft an appropriate patch, I'll retrieve the source code now.

==================================================

Your Output:
I've obtained the source code for the `URLValidator.__call__` method and have sufficient context to implement a patch to address the handling of LF, CR, and tab characters in the URL. Therefore, I am ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

Upon reviewing the patch and the test outputs, here's the analysis:

### Patch Review
The patch directly modifies the return logic of the `strip_accents_unicode` function. It removes the conditional check `if normalized == s: return s`, which erroneously prevents further processing when the string is already in NFKD form. Instead, it ensures that combining characters are removed regardless of whether the string was initially in NFKD form.

### Test Output Comparison
- **Original Output**: The test fails and returns an assertion error for `s2`. Despite being visually identical to `s1`, the function returns `s2` unchanged due to the string already being in NFKD form. Thus, the expected result (`n`) was not achieved for `s2`.
- **Patched Output**: After applying the patch, both `s1` and `s2` result in the expected output (`n`). The test successfully passes, demonstrating that the combining tilde in `s2` is stripped correctly.

### Issue Resolution
Given that the test now outputs the expected results for both `s1` and `s2`, the issue regarding `strip_accents_unicode` has been resolved.

Issue resolved: `True`

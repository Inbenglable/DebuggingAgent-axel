The code in the method `DatabaseCache._cull` at lines 255-272 is responsible for culling entries from the database-backed cache when the number of entries exceeds `MAX_ENTRIES`. The error occurs at line 272 when the code attempts to access `cursor.fetchone()[0]`, which assumes that the previous SQL query has returned at least one row. 

The crucial SQL query is executed at line 268, which should return the cache key to be used for limiting deletions. However, if this query returns no rows, then `cursor.fetchone()` will return `None`, and attempting to subscript this (`[0]`) results in a `TypeError` because `None` does not support subscription.

To better understand this issue, we need to inspect the details of the operation at lines 268-272, ensuring that the query indeed returns a result. Since the observation suggests a gap that might not be addressed by checking the return value of `cursor.fetchone()`, we should focus on these lines:

Observed scope: `django/core/cache/backends/db.py:268-272`

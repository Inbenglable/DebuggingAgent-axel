To analyze the API returned content, I'll examine each snippet to determine if they are relevant to the issue of checking extension versions in a non-string-like manner. The goal is to identify the part of the Sphinx code that is responsible for version checking.

1. **tests/test_extension.py:11-17**
    - This snippet appears to be related to testing the needs_extensions feature, but it does not contain the specific code for version comparison. However, the test function could help validate any changes made to the underlying logic for checking extension versions.

2. **sphinx/extension.py:39-45**
    - This snippet contains the implementation of the `verify_needs_extensions` function. This function is directly relevant as it is responsible for verifying required Sphinx extensions, which likely includes version comparisons.

3. **sphinx/config.py:127-133**
    - This snippet shows configuration options available to Sphinx, including the `needs_extensions` configuration. While this provides context on how extensions are defined within the configuration, it does not directly relate to the logic of version checking.

Based on this analysis, the relevant contents that are needed for addressing the issue are:

```
sphinx/extension.py:39-45
```

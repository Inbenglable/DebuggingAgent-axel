To resolve the issue of enabling the `:private-members:` directive to accept specific private members, I will update the `filter_members` method to interpret the `private_members` option as either a boolean or a list/set of member names. This modification ensures that the user can specify which private members to document explicitly.

Here is the patch in the required SEARCH/REPLACE format:

```python
### sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            elif want_all and isprivate:
                keep = self.options.private_members and \
                    (has_doc or self.options.undoc_members)
=======
            elif want_all and isprivate:
                if isinstance(self.options.private_members, (list, set)):
                    # Support specific private member names
                    keep = membername in self.options.private_members
                else:
                    # Existing logic for boolean private_members option
                    keep = self.options.private_members and \
                        (has_doc or self.options.undoc_members)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change allows `:private-members:` to be specified with particular member names while retaining backward compatibility with the existing boolean usage. Here's the JSON format for the edit:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            elif want_all and isprivate:\n                keep = self.options.private_members and \\\n                    (has_doc or self.options.undoc_members)\n=======\n            elif want_all and isprivate:\n                if isinstance(self.options.private_members, (list, set)):\n                    # Support specific private member names\n                    keep = membername in self.options.private_members\n                else:\n                    # Existing logic for boolean private_members option\n                    keep = self.options.private_members and \\\n                        (has_doc or self.options.undoc_members)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

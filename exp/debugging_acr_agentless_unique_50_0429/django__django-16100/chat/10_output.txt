Based on the information provided, the issue arises from the improper configuration of Django settings. The error message "Requested setting INSTALLED_APPS, but settings are not configured" indicates that the Django environment is not set up correctly before accessing the settings.

The current observation from `LazySettings._setup` method highlights that the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable is not set, leading to an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception. This happens because the test script attempts to import Django models and functionalities before properly setting up the environment.

### Key Points:
- The `settings_module` variable is `None`, which implies the environment variable `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is not defined or is incorrect.
- The test shows this as occurring when we try to access `INSTALLED_APPS`, triggering a check for a valid settings configuration, which fails.

Given this trace, it seems the failure occurs due to the settings not being configured before accessing Django modules. Likely, this isn't a direct issue with a function in the Django codebase itself but with how the test script is structured.

### Next Steps:
Before concluding if there's a fix needed directly within Django's source code, it's critical to confirm the setup sequence in the test script. We should check if Django's settings are being properly initialized before any part of Django is imported.

**For further tracing (if necessary):**
I would examine the initialization of Django settings in the script to ensure that `django.setup()` is called immediately after setting the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` and before any Django imports.

**Observation focused on test setup (if going deeper):**
- Scope to ensure `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is defined correctly before any settings access or Django import: `reproduce.py:3-6`

If the error is solely due to test misconfiguration, adjust the test or setup to address the sequence of initialization.

For now, let's ensure the initial setup in the script aligns properly with best practices. Please confirm this portion is correctly configured or explore the `reproduce.py:3-6` scope for proper initialization.

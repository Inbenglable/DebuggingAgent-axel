To resolve the issue, we need to examine the `_sparse_fit` method, which, according to the traceback, is involved in the error. Since `_sparse_fit` appears to be a method within the SVM-related module, we need to search for its source code within the relevant file.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("_sparse_fit")
```

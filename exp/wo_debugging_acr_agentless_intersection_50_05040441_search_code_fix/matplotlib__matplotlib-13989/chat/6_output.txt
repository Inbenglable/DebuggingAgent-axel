To fix the issue where `hist()` no longer respects the `range` parameter when `density=True`, we need to modify the `Axes.hist` method. The logic to apply `range` should be enforced while computing the histogram, specifically when the `density` is set. 

Here is the patch to correct this behavior:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            hist_kwargs = dict(density=density)\n=======\n            hist_kwargs = dict(density=density, range=bin_range)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation:
- The issue is that the `range` parameter should affect the bin range regardless of whether `density` is `True` or `False`. This involves ensuring that `range=bin_range` is included in `hist_kwargs` so that it is respected during the histogram calculation. The patch modifies this to include `range` in the keyword arguments for the histogram calculation whenever `density` is set. 

This modification respects the user's specified range while calculating the histogram with density normalization.

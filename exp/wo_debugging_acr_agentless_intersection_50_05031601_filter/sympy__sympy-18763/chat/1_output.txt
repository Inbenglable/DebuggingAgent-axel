To resolve the issue, I need to find where the LaTeX representation of `Subs` objects is being formatted in the sympy codebase. Typically, this will be handled in a function related to printing, likely within a class or module that oversees LaTeX rendering. To identify the exact location, I'll search for the relevant method dealing with LaTeX printing for `Subs`.

Given these requirements, I should start by searching for the `Subs` class, and related print methods might be found within `sympy/printing/latex.py` or similar files.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Subs")
search_method_in_codebase("latex")
search_method_in_codebase("Subs._latex")
```

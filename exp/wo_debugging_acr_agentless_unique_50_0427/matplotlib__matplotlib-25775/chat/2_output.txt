After analyzing the API returned content, we need to determine which files are relevant to implementing the `get/set_antialiased` methods for Text objects in Matplotlib.

1. #### lib/matplotlib/text.py:Text:
   - This file seems to contain the primary definition of the `Text` class within Matplotlib. We need to add methods to this class to implement the `get/set_antialiased` functionality based on the rcParams.

2. #### lib/matplotlib/dviread.py:Text:
   - This is a separate Text class used for handling DVI file glyphs. It does not seem directly related to the main Text class used for rendering and appearance settings in Matplotlib plots. Thus, it is irrelevant for the proposed solution.

Based on this evaluation, the content needed for this task is:

```
lib/matplotlib/text.py:Text
```

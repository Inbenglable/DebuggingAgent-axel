The issue described involves the `merge` function from the **xarray** library, specifically when using the `combine_attrs='override'` parameter. The problem is that the attributes of the merged dataset reference the attributes of the first dataset instead of copying them, leading to unwanted behavior when the attributes of the merged dataset are modified.

### Analysis of the Original Test Output:
Before the patch was applied, the test demonstrated the issue clearly:
- Creating two datasets, `xds1` and `xds2`, with different attributes.
- Merging them into `xds3`.
- Modifying the attribute on `xds3`.
- Observing that the attribute on `xds1` changes unexpectedly, raising an `AssertionError`.

### Review of the Patch:
The patch modifies the `override` logic in the `merge.py` file:

- **Search:**
  ```python
  return variable_attrs[0]
  ```

- **Replace:**
  ```python
  return dict(variable_attrs[0])
  ```

This change ensures that when the `attrs` from the first dataset are used, they are copied into a new dictionary, thereby preventing any modifications to `xds3.attrs` from affecting `xds1.attrs`.

### Analysis of the Patched Test Output:
After applying the patch, the test output is empty, indicating that no errors were raised. This implies:
- The assertion `assert xds1.attrs['a'] == 'b', "Attribute 'a' in xds1 was changed unexpectedly."` passed successfully.
- The changes in `xds3.attrs` no longer affect `xds1.attrs`.

### Conclusion:
Based on the test results and the patch review, the issue is resolved. The attributes are now correctly copied instead of referenced, preventing unexpected changes in the source dataset's attributes.

Issue resolved: `True`

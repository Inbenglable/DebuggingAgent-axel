To address the issue, we need to modify the `FileInput` class to ensure it handles the `required` attribute appropriately when initial data is present. Based on the available information, I've gathered the necessary context for the `ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute` method. However, I havenâ€™t seen a `use_required_attribute` method within the `FileInput` class itself.

I need to check if there's a base implementation of `use_required_attribute` in the parent class to understand the current handling and inheritance of the method in `FileInput`. This may provide more insight into how to integrate the logic for managing the `required` attribute. Based on typical Django widget hierarchy, `Input` is likely a direct or indirect parent class of `FileInput`.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "Input.use_required_attribute")
search_class_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "Input")
```

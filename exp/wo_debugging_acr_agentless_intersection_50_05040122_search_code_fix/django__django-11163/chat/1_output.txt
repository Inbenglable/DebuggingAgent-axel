To resolve the issue with the `model_to_dict` function, I need to ensure that I have the source code of this specific function available before generating the patch. I will search for its source code within the Django project codebase. 

Since I don't have the file path where the `model_to_dict` function is defined, I will use the search API to locate it.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("model_to_dict")
```

To resolve the reported issue in the `trim_docstring` method, the code should be modified to skip the first line when calculating the minimum indentation. Here's the patch that should be applied in the `django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py` file:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())\n=======\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

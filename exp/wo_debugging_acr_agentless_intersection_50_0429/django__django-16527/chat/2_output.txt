Based on the information retrieved, we have the essential portion of the code from the `django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py` file regarding the `show_save_as_new` logic. The suggested fix is to add an additional check for `has_add_permission` to the condition. Since the necessary logic has been identified and we have the surrounding code, we are ready to generate the patch without needing further code retrieval.

Ready generation: `True`

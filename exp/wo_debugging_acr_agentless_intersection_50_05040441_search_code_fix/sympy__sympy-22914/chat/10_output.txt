The patch adds the necessary `_print_Min` and `_print_Max` methods to the `PythonCodePrinter` class, which allows it to generate Python code for the SymPy functions `Min` and `Max`. These methods construct the Python `min()` and `max()` functions using the arguments provided to `Min` and `Max`.

The original test output indicates that before applying the patch, `pycode(Min(a, b))` produced `((a) if (a <= b) else (b))`, which wasn't in the expected format (`min(a, b)`). This difference led to an assertion error.

After applying the patch, the test output is empty, indicating that the expected output matches the actual output, and no assertion errors were raised. Therefore, the changes have resolved the issue with the `PythonCodePrinter` regarding the support for `Min` and `Max`.

Issue resolved: `True`

The abnormal program behavior, as described in the issue, is that the `mincnt` parameter of the `hexbin` function exhibits inconsistent behavior depending on whether the `C` parameter is supplied.

In particular:
- When `C` is not provided, setting `mincnt=1` results in grid points being displayed if they contain at least one datum.
- However, when `C` is provided along with `mincnt=1`, the grid points are displayed only if they contain at least two data points, which is unexpected.

The aim is to trace through the code and observe where this discrepancy might arise. The locations provided in the issue give us precise points to start our inspection in the `Axes.hexbin` method since it handles the logic involving `mincnt`.

Let's start by observing the method handling `mincnt` logic with and without the `C` parameter. Given this context, the initial focus will be on `Axes.hexbin` in the file where the behavior is defined. I will begin by examining how the `mincnt` parameter is managed at two points: when `C` is None and when `C` is provided, as described in the links:

Observed method: `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py:Axes.hexbin`

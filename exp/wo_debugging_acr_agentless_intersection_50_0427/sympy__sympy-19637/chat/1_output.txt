To resolve the issue with the `kernS` function from `sympy.core.sympify`, I would first need to gather the source code of the `kernS` function, as the error indicates there is a variable `kern` that is referenced before assignment within this function. Since the file path is provided as `sympy/core/sympify.py`, I will search for the `kernS` method in this file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/core/sympify.py", "kernS")
```

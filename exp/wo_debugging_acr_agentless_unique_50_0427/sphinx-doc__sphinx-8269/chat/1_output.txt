The issue involves how the `linkcheck` command in Sphinx reports errors when the server responds with an error status code. The problem is centered around how HTTP errors are reported when `linkcheck_anchors` is set to `True`. 

To resolve this, I need to understand how the HTTP response and anchor checking are currently handled in the code. Specifically, I'll need to investigate the part of the codebase where the `linkcheck` feature is implemented, particularly focusing on how errors and anchors are checked and reported.

I will search for the relevant code in the Sphinx project codebase to gather the necessary information.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("linkcheck")
search_code_in_codebase("linkcheck_anchors")
```

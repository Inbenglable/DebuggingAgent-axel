## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Make the element_id argument of json_script optional
Description
	
I recently had a use-case where I wanted to use json_script but I didn't need any id for it (I was including the <script> inside a <template> so I didn't need an id to refer to it).
I can't see any reason (security or otherwise) for the id to be required and making it optional doesn't seem to break any tests.

In the previous round, you called search APIs to retrieve relevant source code that would help identify the root cause of the issue and generate a patch. However, the code you retrieved appears in multiple locations (maybe some are irrelevant but have same key). So now your task is to determine which of the retrieved contents are indeed you need, and filter out the irrelevant ones.
This is your API invocation round output:
To resolve the issue, I need to look at the source code of the `json_script` function to understand its current implementation and how the `element_id` argument is being used. This will help in making the argument optional. Let's start by searching for the `json_script` method in the Django codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("json_script")
```

And this is the corresponding API returned result (each content is started with #### FILE_PATH:NAME):
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("json_script")
RESULT:
#### django/template/defaultfilters.py:json_script
```python
def json_script(value, element_id):
    """
    Output value JSON-encoded, wrapped in a <script type="application/json">
    tag.
    """
    return _json_script(value, element_id)

```

#### django/utils/html.py:json_script
```python
def json_script(value, element_id):
    """
    Escape all the HTML/XML special characters with their unicode escapes, so
    value is safe to be output anywhere except for inside a tag attribute. Wrap
    the escaped JSON in a script tag.
    """
    from django.core.serializers.json import DjangoJSONEncoder
    json_str = json.dumps(value, cls=DjangoJSONEncoder).translate(_json_script_escapes)
    return format_html(
        '<script id="{}" type="application/json">{}</script>',
        element_id, mark_safe(json_str)
    )

```



Among the API returned contents, there may be some irrelevant ones or not. So now you need to analyze each returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.
Now, please first analyze the API returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.

Then you need to choose you needed ones with the following format:
```
FILE_PATH_1:NAME_1
FILE_PATH_2:NAME_2
...
```

Note:
1. The value of FILE_PATH:NAME, must consistent with the API returned content (but remove the prefix ####).
2. You may select one or more contents, or even all of them if they are indeed you need.

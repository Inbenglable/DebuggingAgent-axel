To address the issue with `InheritDocstrings` not working for properties, we will need to modify the class to handle properties similarly to how it handles functions. Specifically, we will adjust the logic to recognize properties and copy their docstrings from base classes if they are not explicitly defined in the derived class.

Let's generate the necessary patch.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### astropy/utils/misc.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            if (inspect.isfunction(val) and\n=======\n            if ((inspect.isfunction(val) or isinstance(val, property)) and\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch modifies the condition in the loop to check if the item is a function or a property, and then proceeds to handle the docstring inheritance accordingly.

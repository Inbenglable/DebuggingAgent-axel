To fix the issue in the `trim_docstring` function, we need to modify the code so that it skips the first line when calculating the indentation. This will prevent the error mentioned when the first line of the docstring is not empty. Below is the patch in the *SEARCH/REPLACE* format:

```pythony
### django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())
=======
    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's format this edit into the required JSON object:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())\n=======\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch modifies the `trim_docstring` function by ensuring it calculates the minimum indentation of lines (excluding the first line) when the first line of the docstring is not empty to avoid the error.

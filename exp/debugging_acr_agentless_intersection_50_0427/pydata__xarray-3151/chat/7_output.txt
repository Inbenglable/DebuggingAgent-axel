To determine whether the issue has been resolved, let's analyze the patch and the test outputs before and after applying it:

### Analysis of the Patch

The patch modifies the `combine_by_coords` function in the `xarray` library. The logic change in the patch checks whether any identical coordinates vary between datasets before applying monotonicity checks on those dimensions. This change is intended to ensure that the function does not raise a `ValueError` for identical non-monotonic coordinates across datasets, aligning with the documented behavior.

### Original Test Output

The original test output included a traceback indicating a `ValueError` was raised due to non-monotonic global indexes along the `y` dimension. This was expected based on the issue description.

### Patched Test Output

After applying the patch, the test no longer raises a `ValueError`. However, it now raises a `KeyError`. This suggests that applying the fix introduced an issue where one or more keys (likely coordinate dimensions) are being accessed incorrectly or are absent from the expected data structure (`combined_ids`).

### Conclusion

The patch aimed to resolve the issue where `combine_by_coords` improperly required identical coordinate dimensions to be monotonic. However, the introduced change leads to a `KeyError`, indicating new logic errors in handling coordinate dimensions. The intended fix is not successfully implemented because the function fails due to different reasons after patching.

Therefore, the issue is not resolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

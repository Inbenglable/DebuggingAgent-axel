To resolve the bug, I need to inspect the source code of the method `MockDatabaseWrapper.__init__` to understand how it is currently implementing the initialization and how it can be changed to include `settings_dict`. The debugging agent has identified that this is where the problem occurs. Thus, I will proceed to retrieve the source code of the method.

```python
search_method_in_file("reproduce.py", "MockDatabaseWrapper.__init__")
```

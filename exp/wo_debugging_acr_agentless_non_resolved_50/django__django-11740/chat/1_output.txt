To resolve the issue, I need to gather more information on how Django handles dependencies in database migrations, specifically concerning ForeignKey relationships. This typically involves looking into the generated migration files as well as understanding the `ForeignKey` field and migration generation process in Django's code.

First, I will retrieve the code for the `ForeignKey` field and also look for the migration class in Django 2.2 to understand how dependencies are created or if there is a condition under which they might not be.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ForeignKey")
search_class_in_codebase("Migration")
```

These searches should help me understand how the dependencies in migrations for ForeignKey fields are handled in Django.

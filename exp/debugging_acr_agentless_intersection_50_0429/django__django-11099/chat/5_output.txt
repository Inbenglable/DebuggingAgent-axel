Based on the analysis and retrieval of the source code for the `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator`, the task is to modify the regex pattern in both validator classes to avoid allowing usernames with trailing newlines by using `\A` and `\Z` instead of `^` and `$`.

Here's the patch to be applied:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/auth/validators.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    regex = r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'\n=======\n    regex = r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This change ensures that the regex patterns in both `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` classes correctly enforce the beginning and end of a string for valid usernames and prevent usernames that end with a newline.

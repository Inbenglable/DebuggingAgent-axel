Based on the detailed trace analysis and the runtime information, the issue appears to be centered around the logic handling generators and their inverses in the permutation context within the `_check_homomorphism` function. The function currently fails to correctly verify the relations by not handling inverted generators properly, leading to the `ValueError`.

Upon examining the trace, we see that the generators of the DihedralGroup are not correctly mapped when tested against inverses within the `_check_homomorphism`. The specific code at line 336 checks if a generator or its inverse is in the given images but appears to be inadequate for handling these cases.

From this information, it's clear that updating the logic to properly handle the inverses is necessary. The present approach needs refinement to appropriately map and verify the images of these generators.

Given that several lines are involved in the faulty logic surrounding inversion handling and homomorphism verification (especially lines 336 to 343), this section of code within the `_check_homomorphism` method should be scrutinized further.

We can safely identify the buggy method:

Buggy method: `sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py:_check_homomorphism`

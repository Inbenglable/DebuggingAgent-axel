The task at hand is to resolve an issue related to how certain characters (`-`, `+`, `^`) are incorrectly processed as separators when using the `:kbd:` role in Sphinx. This misinterpretation results in incorrect HTML output, where the characters are perceived as separators and the HTML tags are not structured as intended.

The investigation so far has inaccurately observed the `Index.run` method, which deals with index processing and is irrelevant to the `:kbd:` role rendering issue. Therefore, focusing on `Index.run` is not helpful because it does not pertain to the behavior of the `:kbd:` role in rendering HTML.

Given that the `:kbd:` role's issue involves how keystrokes and separators are parsed and rendered, the objective should be to pinpoint where the actual role logic interprets these inputs. Commonly, such logic would reside within the `run` method of the `kbd` role definition or associated visitor methods that render HTML for the `kbd` role.

To pinpoint where this logic resides, I recommend scrutinizing the `KbdRole.run` method or any related method responsible for handling the `:kbd:` role transformation into HTML.

Since specific role management is likely defined in `sphinx/roles.py`, we will need to observe the method responsible for the `:kbd:` role processing.

Let's proceed by observing the scope where the keystroke logic is being incorrectly interpreted for the `:kbd:` role:

Observed scope: `sphinx/roles.py:KbdRole.run`

I have retrieved the source code for the `merge_attrs` function, which is where the issue lies. The problem is with the `combine_attrs='override'` case where the function currently returns `variable_attrs[0]`, creating a reference to the attributes instead of copying them.

To resolve this issue, I will modify the behavior to create a copy of the attributes instead. Given the information I have, I am ready to create a patch.

Ready generation: `True`

To determine whether the issue is resolved, let's take a look at what the patch did and analyze the test outputs.

### Patch Analysis

The patch replaces occurrences of `PRAGMA foreign_key_check(%s)` and other statements related to SQL table names to include backticks, like `PRAGMA foreign_key_check(`%s`)`. This is intended to correctly quote table names in SQLite, especially if they are reserved SQL keywords such as "order".

### Test Output Analysis

#### Before Patch

Before the patch, the test fails with a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'test_app'`. This indicates that the script fails at the setup phase due to missing the `test_app` module, and the actual logic regarding SQL reserved table names is never reached or tested.

#### After Patch

After the patch, the test fails with the same error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'test_app'`. Again, this indicates that the test cannot proceed beyond the setup phase, and thus the patch's modifications to handling SQL reserved table names have not been validated or executed.

### Conclusion

The issue regarding `loaddata` crashing due to SQL reserved table names has not been validated because the test fails due to missing setup components, specifically the missing `test_app` module. Since the test did not reach the point where the patch could be evaluated, we cannot confirm that the patch resolved the issue. Therefore, based on the available information:

Issue resolved: `False`

To resolve this issue, I need to inspect the logic within the `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` classes in the `datetime.py` file of the Django project. Specifically, I need to examine how the `tzinfo` parameter is being handled. 

I'll start by searching for the `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` classes and any relevant methods within the `django/db/models/functions/datetime.py` file.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncDate")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncTime")
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "get_current_timezone_name")
```

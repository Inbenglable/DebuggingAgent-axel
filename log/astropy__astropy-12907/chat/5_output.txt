The observed abnormal behavior was linked to the way nested `CompoundModel` objects are handled in the `separability_matrix` function, leading to incorrect assertions of separability when models are nested. The `_separable` function's behavior is crucial here, particularly in how it processes `sepleft` and `sepright` matrices with the `_cstack` function.

Reviewing the trace runtime:

- `_cstack` takes separability matrices (`sepleft` and `sepright`), and is supposed to form a single separability matrix that represents the compound structure.
- The trace output for `_cstack` when dealing with the nested models shows the resulting matrix as being non-separable, e.g., inputs from `Pix2Sky_TAN()` relate to all outputs of the nested Linear1D models.
- The trace through line 309 indicates the root of the issue appears to be related to how `_operators[transform.op]` combines the separability matrices of the nested structures.

Given the above analysis and how and where the logic appears to falter, it seems the issue might well lie in the `_cstack` function, responsible for consolidating the separability presence of nested models within the function `_separable`.

Based on this trace, let's locate and focus on the `_cstack` function's implementation, given it encapsulates the pivotal transformation visibly affecting the nested model representation.

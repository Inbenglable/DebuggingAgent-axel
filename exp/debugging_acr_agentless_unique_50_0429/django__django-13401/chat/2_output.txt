The current issue is rooted in the configuration of Django models in the provided script. The error message `Model class __main__.B doesn't declare an explicit app_label and isn't in an application in INSTALLED_APPS.` indicates that the models `B` and `C` are not recognized as belonging to any Django application, primarily because they do not have explicit `app_label`s specified, and the script does not declare any dummy app in `INSTALLED_APPS` for them.

Django uses the `ModelBase.__new__` method for model class instantiation and checks whether the model is part of an application by using the `apps.get_containing_app_config` method. Since these models are defined in the `__main__` module during script execution, `apps.get_containing_app_config(module)` returns `None`, leading to the raised `RuntimeError`.

To resolve this issue, modifications in the script are necessary. It should include a dummy application within `INSTALLED_APPS` for the models or assign an explicit `app_label` within the modelsâ€™ `Meta` subclasses.

The root of the problem lies within the `ModelBase.__new__` method, specifically between lines 108 and 117, where the code attempts to retrieve an app configuration and validates the presence of the `app_label`.

Given this understanding, we can locate the problematic area where the issue arises:

Buggy method: `django/db/models/base.py:ModelBase.__new__`

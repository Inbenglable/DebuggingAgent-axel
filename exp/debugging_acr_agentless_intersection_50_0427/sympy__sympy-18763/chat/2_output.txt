Analyzing the current observed code and abnormal program behavior, we can see that the `LatexPrinter._print_Subs` method generates a LaTeX expression without adding parentheses around the main expression (`-x + y`). This is likely because the `latex_expr` generated by `self._print(expr)` doesn't include parentheses around the addition operation. 

The current output is `3 \left. - x + y \right|_{\substack{ x=1 }}` and the expected output is `3 \left. \left(- x + y\right) \right|_{\substack{ x=1 }}`. The lack of parentheses around `-x + y` within the `Subs` is causing the issue when multiplied by 3.

Observing the method `LatexPrinter._print_Add` might help, as it's responsible for printing expressions like `-x + y` in LaTeX format. I suspect this is where the parentheses should have been added.

Therefore, I want to focus on analyzing the addition printing logic to determine the correct insertion of parentheses.

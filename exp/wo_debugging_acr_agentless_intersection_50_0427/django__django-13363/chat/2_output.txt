To properly address the issue, I need to review the code in the `as_sql` method for both the `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` classes. These methods are likely where the timezone information is being handled incorrectly. Additionally, I need to examine the `get_current_timezone_name` method that is presumably responsible for retrieving the current timezone. This will help me understand how the program is discarding the specified tzinfo object in favor of the default timezone. 

I'll retrieve the necessary code to make the patch:

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncDate.as_sql")
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncTime.as_sql")
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "get_current_timezone_name")
```

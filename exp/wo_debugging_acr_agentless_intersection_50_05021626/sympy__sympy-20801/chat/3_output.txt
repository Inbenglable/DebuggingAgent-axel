To understand how to fix the issue, I need to examine the implementation related to the `BooleanAtom` class, particularly how it handles equality operations for different types, including numbers. The probable location of this logic is in the `boolalg.py` file based on the class location.

Therefore, I'll retrieve the `__eq__` method (if any) within the `BooleanAtom` class to investigate how the equality logic is currently implemented for Boolean values and how it can be extended or modified to properly handle the comparison between `S(0.0)` and `S.false`.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/logic/boolalg.py", "BooleanAtom.__eq__")
```

To fix the issue with `_check_homomorphism` and the `_image()` function in SymPy's permutation group homomorphisms, I need to get the source code of the `_image()` method to understand its implementation. This will help in simplifying the logic and ensuring proper handling when `r[i]` is an inverted generator.

I am not provided with the specific file path where `_image()` is defined. Thus, I will first search for `_image()` in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("_image")
```

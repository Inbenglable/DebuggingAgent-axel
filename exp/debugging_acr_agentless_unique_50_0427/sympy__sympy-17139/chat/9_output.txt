To resolve the issue, we will modify the `_TR56` function to correctly handle the case where the exponent is complex. We should verify if the exponent is a number and if it has a positive real component before making comparisons or any assumptions that lead to numerical operations.

Here's the patch that resolves the issue:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/simplify/fu.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if (rv.exp < 0) == True:\n=======\n        if rv.exp.is_number and rv.exp.as_real_imag()[0] < 0:\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### sympy/simplify/fu.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if (rv.exp > max) == True:\n=======\n        if rv.exp.is_number and rv.exp.as_real_imag()[0] > max:\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

These changes ensure that the conditionals correctly handle cases where the exponent is complex by checking if the exponent is a number and then analyzing its real part. This should prevent the `TypeError` related to complex number comparisons from occurring.

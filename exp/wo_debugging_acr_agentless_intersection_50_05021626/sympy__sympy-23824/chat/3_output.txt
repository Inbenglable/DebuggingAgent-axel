To resolve the bug that was described in the issue, where leading uncontracted gamma matrices are incorrectly reversed in the `kahane_simplify` function, we need to adjust the handling of leading free indices during the simplification process. Let's provide the necessary patch in "SEARCH/REPLACE" format to address this:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/physics/hep/gamma_matrices.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    for i in range(0, first_dum_pos):\n        [ri.insert(0, free_pos[i]) for ri in resulting_indices]\n=======\n    for i in range(first_dum_pos - 1, -1, -1):\n        [ri.insert(0, free_pos[i]) for ri in resulting_indices]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Adjustment of Loop**: The search-replace patch changes the loop that inserts leading free gamma indices back into the resulting expression. Originally, the loop incorrectly prepended indices causing the order to be reversed. By changing the loop to iterate in reverse (from `first_dum_pos - 1` to `0`), we ensure that leading free indices maintain their correct order.

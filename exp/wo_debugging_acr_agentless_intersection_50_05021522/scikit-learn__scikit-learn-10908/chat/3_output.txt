Based on the retrieved code, the issue lies in the `get_feature_names` method of the `CountVectorizer` class, which calls `_check_vocabulary`. The `_check_vocabulary` method raises a `NotFittedError` if `vocabulary_` is not set, even if a vocabulary was provided during initialization.

To fix the issue, we can modify the `get_feature_names` method to check if a vocabulary was provided during initialization and avoid calling `_check_vocabulary` in such cases.

I have enough information to generate a patch to fix the bug in `CountVectorizer.get_feature_names`.

Ready generation: `True`

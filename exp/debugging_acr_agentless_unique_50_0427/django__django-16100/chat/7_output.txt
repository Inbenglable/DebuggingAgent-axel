From the information provided, it appears that the core issue arises from the Django settings not being properly configured before accessing components that depend on them. The method we're currently observing, `UserSettingsHolder.__init__`, is responsible for setting up configuration variables by utilizing a default settings module.

1. **Abnormal Behavior**:
   - The traceback indicates that something is wrong with setting up the settings module, as shown by the `ImproperlyConfigured` error that's being raised. This suggests a misconfiguration or mistiming in setting the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable or another related configuration error in Django setup.

2. **Context**:
   - The `UserSettingsHolder.__init__` method initializes an instance meant to hold user settings, defaulting to those defined in `default_settings`. This method doesn't directly raise the `ImproperlyConfigured` error but might be erroneously initialized if the settings module isn't defined correctly.

3. **Suspicion**:
   - If the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` isn't set or isn't correctly configured before attempting to initialize anything that depends on settings (like `User`), Django will raise an error. The error here seems to be occurring because there is some setup or trace issue with Conda environment assertion, likely indicating something went wrong in environment setup or with the paths we're testing against.

Given that the error in focus seems to be deeply integrative within Django's setup and potentially environment-specific provided by Conda, let us further focus on the initialization to place our assertions beyond the `UserSettingsHolder` that likely runs after or upon actual `Settings` setup.

To further diagnose and confirm the exact mishap, we need to explore the code of the `LazySettings` and particularly focus on its initialization logic executed before reaching `UserSettingsHolder`.

Let's proceed with an analysis of `LazySettings` to verify when `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is ensured to be set correctly.

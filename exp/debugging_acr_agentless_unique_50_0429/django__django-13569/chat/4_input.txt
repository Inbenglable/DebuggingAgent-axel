<ISSUE>
order_by('?') unexpectedly breaking queryset aggregation
Description
	
Steps to reproduce:
class Thing(models.Model):
	pass
class Related(models.Model):
	models.ForeignKey(Thing)
With data
t = Thing.objects.create()
rs = [Related.objects.create(thing=t) for _ in range(2)]
The following query works as expected. The aggregation with Count produces a GROUP BY clause on related.id.
>>> Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('rc').values('id', 'rc')
<QuerySet [{'id': 1, 'rc': 2}]>
This also works as expected (at least to me). Although there is an aggregation, ordering by related means that the grouping will be broken down.
>>> Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('related').values('id', 'rc')
<QuerySet [{'id': 1, 'rc': 1}, {'id': 1, 'rc': 1}]>
But the following seems wrong to me.
>>> Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('?').values('id', 'rc')
<QuerySet [{'id': 1, 'rc': 1}, {'id': 1, 'rc': 1}]>
The random function call has nothing to do with the aggregation, and I see no reason it should break it. Dumping the query seems that indeed the random call breaks the group by call: (I simpilfied the table names a little)
>>> print(Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('?').values('id', 'rc').query)
SELECT "thing"."id", COUNT("related"."id") AS "rc" FROM "thing" LEFT OUTER JOIN "related" ON ("thing"."id" = "related"."thing_id") GROUP BY "thing"."id", RANDOM() ORDER BY RANDOM() ASC
I dug into the SQL compiler, and it seems to me the problem is inside django.db.models.sql.compiler.get_group_by, where the compiler combines all non-aggregate, non-ref order_by expressions into group_by. I patched it like this
for expr, (sql, params, is_ref) in order_by:
	if expr.contains_aggregate:
		continue
	if is_ref:
		continue
	expressions.extend([
		exp for exp in expr.get_source_expressions()
		if not isinstance(exp, Random)
	])
and things seem to work correctly. No failed tests against SQLite3 with default settings.

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
The issue described involves the unexpected behavior of the `order_by('?')` clause when used in conjunction with an aggregate function like `Count`. The issue arises because using `order_by('?')` seems to disrupt the aggregation operation, causing the aggregation results to be incorrect.

The function `django.db.models.sql.compiler.get_group_by` in the Django codebase is highlighted as the potential source of the problem. The `get_group_by` function is responsible for generating the SQL `GROUP BY` clause, and the inclusion of non-aggregate, non-reference `order_by` expressions may incorrectly cause the aggregate grouping to break down when it encounters random ordering.

The debugging output shows an error in the test setup script when trying to execute the test file `run_debugging_test.py`. The error indicates `NameError: name 'sys' is not defined`, which is an unrelated issue to the main counting and aggregation problem. This error pertains to how the Python environment was set up for running the test script and does not directly relate to the aggregation issue in Django.

To fix the original aggregation issue in the Django code, we need to inspect the `get_group_by` function for how it handles random ordering and aggregation functions. I will now proceed to examine this function.

Observed method: `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py:get_group_by`
==================================================
The issue at hand is related to how Django constructs the `GROUP BY` clause in SQL queries when using aggregation in conjunction with `order_by('?')`. Specifically, the inclusion of a random order seems to result in incorrect aggregation by disrupting the intended grouping.

Upon analyzing the provided method `SQLCompiler.get_group_by` in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`, we can see that the function aims to determine the SQL `GROUP BY` clause based on the provided expressions. The logic combines expressions from the select, order_by, and having clauses to form the final `GROUP BY` list.

Here's a breakdown of relevant sections of the code:

- The function checks `self.query.group_by` to determine how to build the `GROUP BY` clause.
- Line 128 iterates over `order_by` expressions and calls `get_group_by_cols()` to derive columns needed for grouping.
- The problematic behavior may arise if `order_by('?')` involves a random expression, which should not be part of `GROUP BY`.

The patch suggestion from the issue description proposes checking if an expression contains a random ordering and excluding it from the `GROUP BY` clause. This suggests that the problem is within this loop where `order_by` expressions are being added to the group by expressions.

Given this analysis, the `SQLCompiler.get_group_by` method is relevant, specifically the section handling `order_by` expressions.

To pinpoint the exact cause and confirm the fix, we need to examine the process of adding `order_by` expressions to `GROUP BY`. Focusing on lines 128-132 where `order_by` terms are processed will help us verify the presence of random expressions and their improper inclusion.

Observed scope: `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py:128-132`
==================================================
Based on the information provided and the tracing history, the issue originates from the behavior of the `SQLCompiler.get_group_by` method within the Django codebase. The problem seems to arise when using the `order_by('?')` clause, causing the inclusion of random expressions in the `GROUP BY` clause, thus breaking the intended aggregation.

In the observed code snippet from the `get_group_by` method:

```python
128	        for expr, (sql, params, is_ref) in order_by:
129	            # Skip References to the select clause, as all expressions in the
130	            # select clause are already part of the group by.
131	            if not is_ref:
132	                expressions.extend(expr.get_group_by_cols())
```

Within this loop, the function seems to collect expressions from the `order_by` clause and include them in the `GROUP BY` clause, unless they are references (`is_ref`). The issue, as indicated by the debug information and proposed patch, lies in the inclusion of expressions generated by `order_by('?')`.

The fix suggested involves checking if an expression has a random ordering (`Random`) and excluding it from consideration, thus avoiding the erroneous addition to the `GROUP BY` clause. This aligns with the information provided in the initial issue description, where a patch had been proposed for this exact part of the code.

The abnormal program behavior ultimately results in an incorrect SQL query formation due to the erroneous `GROUP BY` behavior. The suggestion to modify this loop to exclude random expressions is likely a suitable resolution to prevent `GROUP BY` from being disrupted.

Therefore, I can deduce that the problematic behavior is indeed within the `SQLCompiler.get_group_by` method. The debugger feedback and the provided test indicate that the addition of random expressions to `GROUP BY` is the central issue.

Buggy method: `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py:SQLCompiler.get_group_by`

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

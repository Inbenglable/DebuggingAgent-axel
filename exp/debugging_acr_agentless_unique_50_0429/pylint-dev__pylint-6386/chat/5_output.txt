Based on the provided runtime information, we can see that the issue is coming from the argument parsing process in the `_parse_command_line_configuration` method. The relevant error seems to be attributed to how the `argparse` handles the `-v` (short verbose) option. The `action` variable indicates the different argument parsing rules applied to each option. Particularly, the `--verbose` option is specified without a requirement for an argument, whereas `-v` is incorrectly expecting one.

The issue seems to arise from the configuration of the `argparse.ArgumentParser` where these options (`option_strings= ['--verbose', '-v']`) are defined. The setup for these options likely specifies the need for an argument, which causes `argparse.ArgumentParser` to expect it.

Given this analysis, it seems appropriate to trace upstream where the argument parser options are added, especially focusing on the configuration related to `verbose` options.

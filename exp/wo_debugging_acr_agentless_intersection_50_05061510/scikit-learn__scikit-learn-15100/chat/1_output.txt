To address the bug in `strip_accents_unicode`, I need to review the source code of the `strip_accents_unicode` method. This will allow me to identify how accents are stripped and why the issue occurs with strings already in NFKD form. I will start by searching for the method in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("strip_accents_unicode")
```

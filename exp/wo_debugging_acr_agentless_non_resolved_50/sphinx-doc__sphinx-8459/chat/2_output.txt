To determine the contents that are needed to address the issue, I will analyze each returned content to identify relevant code pieces that pertain to the `autodoc_typehints` and `autodoc_type_aliases` configurations, particularly focusing on how they might interact when `autodoc_typehints` is set to "description".

1. **reproduce.py:89-95**: This snippet relates to testing and addressing the issue of the incorrect alias output, with `autodoc_type_aliases` not functioning as expected when `autodoc_typehints` is "description".

2. **conf.py:3-9**: This is a configuration setup showcasing the settings `autodoc_typehints` and `autodoc_type_aliases`. This setup is needed to understand the test scenario but isn't necessarily crucial for code investigation.

3. **tests/test_ext_autodoc_configs.py:783-789**: This test case relates directly to the issue of `autodoc_typehints` set to "description" alongside type aliases. It might provide insights into how these configurations are being applied or tested.

4. **sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py:40-46**: This code snippet shows a function related to merging type hints based on the `autodoc_typehints` configuration. Critical for investigating the issue since the behavior change likely resides here.

5. **sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:2322-2328**: This defines `autodoc_typehints` and `autodoc_type_aliases` in the Sphinx configuration, providing context on how these options are registered and manipulated. It might be useful to understand the overall configuration setup.

The most directly relevant snippets are those from the code that deals with merging or interpreting type hints or aliases and any unit tests or configurations directly illustrating the issue. Based on this, the necessary contents are:

```
reproduce.py:89-95
tests/test_ext_autodoc_configs.py:783-789
sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py:40-46
```
These selections aim to focus directly on the handling of `autodoc_typehints` and `autodoc_type_aliases` configurations, particularly in the context of when `autodoc_typehints` is set to "description."

I have obtained the source code of the `strip_accents_unicode` function. This function uses the Unicode normalization form NFKD and attempts to strip accents by removing combining characters. Since the issue arises when the input is already in NFKD form, the condition `if normalized == s:` incorrectly returns the unchanged string.

The function should always convert to NFKD and remove combining characters, regardless of whether the input is already in NFKD form.

I have sufficient information to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

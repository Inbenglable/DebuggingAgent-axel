To resolve the issue with the `Permutation` constructor handling non-disjoint cycles, I need to review the implementation of the `__new__` method of the `Permutation` class. This method is likely responsible for processing inputs and constructing the permutation, and it seems to be the focal point for constructing the identity permutation when non-disjoint cycles are provided. 

I will proceed with retrieving the source code for the `__new__` method from the `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py", "Permutation.__new__")
```

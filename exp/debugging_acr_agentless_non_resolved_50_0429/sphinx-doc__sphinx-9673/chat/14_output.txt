The current observed snippet lists the section handlers in the `GoogleDocstring.__init__` method. This setup shows that `GoogleDocstring` has specific parsing functions for different docstring sections, like returns, warnings, and references. The `Returns:` section from our Google-style docstring should be handled by one of the entries in this dictionary: lines 192-193 map the 'return' and 'returns' sections to the `_parse_returns_section` method.

Based on the runtime information:
- The test fails with the indication that "Return section is missing in the documentation." This ties directly to the `Returns:` handling configured here but points to a problem that lies in the implementation or invocation of `_parse_returns_section`.

Given this setup, the issue likely arises from the `_parse_returns_section` method not functioning as expected or not properly injecting the parsed output into the documentation content. 

To resolve the issue, the next step is to trace into the `_parse_returns_section` method to understand how the parsing occurs and why it may be failing to integrate the "Returns:" section into the final documentation output.

Observed method: `sphinx/ext/napoleon/docstring.py:GoogleDocstring._parse_returns_section`

To implement the `--skip-checks` option, I need to understand where and how management command options are currently defined and implemented in Django, specifically regarding the existing `skip_checks` stealth option. This likely involves retrieving the source code for Django's base management command class.

I'll start by searching for the base command class or related methods in Django's management command implementation.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("BaseCommand")
search_method_in_codebase("BaseCommand.add_arguments")
search_method_in_codebase("BaseCommand.handle")
```

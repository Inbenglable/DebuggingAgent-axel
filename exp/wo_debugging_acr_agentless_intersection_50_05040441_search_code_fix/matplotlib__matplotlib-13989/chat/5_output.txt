The aim of the patch was to ensure that the `range` parameter is respected when `density=True` in the `plt.hist()` function. However, the patched output indicates a `TypeError` related to multiple values being provided for the `keyword argument 'range'`. 

### Analysis:
1. **Patch Review:**
   - The patch tries to add the `range` parameter to `hist_kwargs` when `density=True`.
   - When calling `np.histogram`, the patch attempts to explicitly pass `range=bin_range` in addition to including it in `hist_kwargs`.

2. **Before the Patch:**
   - The bins did not start at 0 nor end at 1 when `density=True`, which was the original issue.

3. **After the Patch:**
   - The test fails due to a `TypeError`. This error arises because the `range` keyword argument is being passed twice to `np.histogram`: once directly as `range=bin_range` and again through `**hist_kwargs`.

### Conclusion:
The patch introduced a new error instead of resolving the original issue. Therefore, the problem with `hist` not respecting the `range` parameter when `density=True` has not been fixed in this attempt.

Issue resolved: `False`

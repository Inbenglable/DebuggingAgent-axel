To address the issue where `hist()` does not respect the `range` parameter when `density=True`, we will need to scrutinize and adjust the computation of bin edges within the `_axes.hist` method. Specifically, the issue arises when density normalization affects the bins in a manner that ignores the specified range.

Here's the proposed edit that resolves the issue:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            db = np.diff(bins)\n=======\n            db = np.diff(bins)\n            bins[0] = bin_range[0]  # Ensure range is respected.\n            bins[-1] = bin_range[1]  # Ensure range is respected.\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch ensures that the first and last elements of the `bins` array are set to the specified `range` values, making the function honor the provided range parameter.

Please apply the provided edit to rectify the issue.

To implement the `__iter__` method in the `Paginator` class, I need to retrieve the full source code of the `Paginator` class for complete context on how it interacts with its methods, especially `page_range` and `page`. 

Therefore, I will retrieve the source code for the `Paginator` class from the specified file.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/core/paginator.py", "Paginator")
```

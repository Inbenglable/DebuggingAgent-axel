To determine whether the issue is fixed, let's review the provided information:

1. **Original Issue Description**:
   - The function `timesince()` is raising a `TypeError` when using timezone-aware datetime objects with `USE_TZ=True` and a time interval of more than one month. The error results from trying to subtract an offset-naive datetime from an offset-aware datetime.

2. **Original Test Output**:
   - The test output clearly shows that a `TypeError` is raised due to the datetime manipulation in the `timesince()` function, consistent with the issue description.

3. **Patch Description**:
   - The patch modifies the `pivot` datetime construction in `timesince.py` to include `tzinfo=d.tzinfo`, ensuring the timezone information is retained, and both datetime objects are either both offset-naive or both offset-aware.

4. **Patched Test Output**:
   - After applying the patch, the test output is successful, showing "Result: 1 month", which indicates that the test can run without raising a `TypeError`.

Considering that the patch explicitly addresses the cause of the issue—by maintaining the correct timezone consistency—and the test output confirms that the error is no longer present after applying the patch, we can conclude:

Issue resolved: `True`

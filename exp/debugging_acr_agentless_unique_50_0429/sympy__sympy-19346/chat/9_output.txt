I need to retrieve the `ReprPrinter` class code to inspect if there are similar print methods that handle specific SymPy types, and to understand where to add the `_print_set` and `_print_dict` methods. Additionally, I've seen references to `Dict` but without any meaningful print methods being highlighted, indicating a need to further investigate.

```python
search_class_in_file("sympy/printing/printer.py", "ReprPrinter")
search_code_in_file("sympy/printing/printer.py", "FiniteSet")
```

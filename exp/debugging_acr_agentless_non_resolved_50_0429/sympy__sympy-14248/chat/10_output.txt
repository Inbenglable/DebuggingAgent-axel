To determine whether the issue has been fixed, let's analyze the provided patch and the outputs before and after applying the patch.

### Patch Analysis

The patch modifies the part of the code responsible for printing terms to detect subtractions specifically. This is done by checking if a term is a multiplication (`Mul`) where the first argument is `-1`. If so, it signifies that the term should be printed with a minus sign.

### Original Output

The original output shows that the test fails because the string representations of matrix expressions containing subtractions are printed incorrectly. Instead of showing `A - A*B - B`, it shows `(-1)*B + (-1)*A*B + A`.

### Patched Output

The patched output provides the same incorrect result as the original output. It still prints `(-1)*B + (-1)*A*B + A` instead of `A - A*B - B`. This indicates that the patch did not impact or fix the incorrect behavior detected in the test.

### Conclusion

Since the output remains unchanged after applying the patch, it is clear that the issue with the matrix subtraction string representation is not resolved by this patch. The test continues to fail in the same manner as before the patch was applied.

Hence, the issue is not fixed.

Issue resolved: `False`

To address the issue, we need to look further into how the `hist` method works. Specifically, we need to locate the source code for the `hist` method that is being called from `gca().hist`. This will likely be defined in a class related to the plot's axes, such as `Axes.hist`.

First, let's search for the `hist` method in the class that is likely part of a module dealing with axes, possibly in `axes/_axes.py` or a similarly named file. This will allow us to identify the logic that needs modification.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("Axes.hist")
```

To understand the issue, let's analyze the code execution and the error trace in the `sympy` library. The reported issue is an `IndexError` occurring when the `sqrtdenest` function is called with a specific expression.

The error trace indicates that the problem originates from the `split_surds` function, specifically inside the `_split_gcd` utility function. The goal is for `sqrtdenest` to return the input expression unchanged if it cannot be denested, but instead, an `IndexError` is thrown. This implies something unexpected is happening while processing the surds.

From the logs and trace, we see `split_surds` leads to `_split_gcd`, which has an issue since it's accessing the first element of a list `a`, which is likely empty or improperly constructed.

At this point, the observed issue occurs in the method `_split_gcd`. To investigate further and identify why `a` is empty or improperly set, we should observe the internal workings of `_split_gcd`.

Therefore, the next method to observe is:

Observed method: `sympy/simplify/radsimp.py:_split_gcd`

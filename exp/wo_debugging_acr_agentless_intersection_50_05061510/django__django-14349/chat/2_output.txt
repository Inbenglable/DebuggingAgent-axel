To properly assess how the `URLValidator` should be modified to handle LF, CR, and tab characters, I need to retrieve the implementation details of the `__call__` method, which seems to be responsible for the validation process.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/validators.py", "URLValidator.__call__")
```

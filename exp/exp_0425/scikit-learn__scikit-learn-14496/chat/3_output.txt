The issue has been identified in the `OPTICS.fit` method, and it seems that the problem stems from lines of code that were not outlined in the method's implementation details called `compute_optics_graph`. Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code of `compute_optics_graph` to see where the `min_samples` is being processed and identify where the change needs to be applied. 

I'll trace `compute_optics_graph` to its definition and examine how `min_samples` is used there.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("compute_optics_graph")
```

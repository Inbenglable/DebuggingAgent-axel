To address the issue, I need to understand how the different types of expressions involving MatrixSymbols are being printed. The key aspect is identifying where the conversion from symbolic expression to a string (or LaTeX, or pretty) format happens for `MatrixSymbol` expressions. I will investigate the `MatrixSymbol` and related classes in SymPy to identify how expressions involving `MatrixSymbol` are printed. I will start by searching for the `MatrixSymbol` class and the relevant printer methods to gather source code that handles the conversion of symbolic expressions to string or other formats.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("MatrixSymbol")
search_method_in_codebase("StrPrinter._print_MatrixSymbol")
search_method_in_codebase("PrettyPrinter._print_MatrixSymbol")
search_method_in_codebase("LatexPrinter._print_MatrixSymbol")
```

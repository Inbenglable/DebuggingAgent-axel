To add DISTINCT support to the `Avg` and `Sum` aggregates, I need to review how DISTINCT is currently implemented in other aggregate classes, such as `Count`. This will guide the changes needed for `Avg` and `Sum`. Let's search for the `Count` class in the `django/db/models/aggregates.py` file to see its implementation.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Count")
```

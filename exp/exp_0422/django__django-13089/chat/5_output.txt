To resolve this issue, I need to retrieve the source code for the `BaseDatabaseCache._cull` method to understand its current implementation and add the necessary error handling. I will search for this method in the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/cache/backends/db.py", "BaseDatabaseCache._cull")
```

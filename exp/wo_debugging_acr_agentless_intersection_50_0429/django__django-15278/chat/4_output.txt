To resolve the issue, I need to gather the source code related to SQLite's handling of schema edits, particularly for adding fields with constraints. I will retrieve the implementation of the `SQLiteSchemaEditor` class to explore how SQLite-specific migration logic is applied.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("SQLiteSchemaEditor")
```

Given the retrieved source code and the issue description, we need to fix the formatting of the `CREATE INDEX` statement generation. The relevant code snippet involves adjusting whitespace handling when forming the column definitions, particularly when `col_suffixes` are used.

Since the seen code block deals with incorporating `col_suffixes`, we should retrieve the complete method containing this logic to generate a correct patch.

Let's identify which method this code belongs to and obtain the full source code of that method to ensure our fix addresses the entire context.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/ddl_references.py", "quote_name")
search_method_in_codebase("Columns")
```

These searches will provide the necessary context to apply the fix correctly.

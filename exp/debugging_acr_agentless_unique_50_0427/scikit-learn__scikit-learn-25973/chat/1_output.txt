Based on the traceback provided, the error occurs in the `_aggregate_score_dicts` function inside `sklearn/model_selection/_validation.py`. This function is called by `cross_validate`, which is invoked by the `SequentialFeatureSelector` during the `fit` method. The specific error is an `IndexError: list index out of range` occurring at line 1950 of `_aggregate_score_dicts`, which tries to access `scores[0]`.

The issue seems related to the handling of the cross-validation splits being passed to `SequentialFeatureSelector`. The `cv` parameter is assigned a generator object (`splits`), which might not be producing results as expected during the cross-validation process.

The problem likely arises in how the cross-validation splits or results are processed, which leads to an empty list being accessed, causing the `IndexError`.

To proceed, I need to review the method `SequentialFeatureSelector.fit`, as it interfaces directly with `cross_val_score`, which subsequently leads to `_aggregate_score_dicts`.

Observed method: `sklearn/feature_selection/_sequential.py:SequentialFeatureSelector.fit`

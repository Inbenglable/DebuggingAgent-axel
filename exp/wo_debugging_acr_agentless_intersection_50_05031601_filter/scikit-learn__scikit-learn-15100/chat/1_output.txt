To proceed with the patch, I need to retrieve the source code of the `strip_accents_unicode` method to understand its implementation and make necessary modifications to handle strings that are already in NFKD form correctly.

Since I don't have the file path of the method, I will search for the method in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("strip_accents_unicode")
```

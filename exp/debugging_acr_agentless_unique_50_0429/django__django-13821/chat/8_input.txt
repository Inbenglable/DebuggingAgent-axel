## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Drop support for SQLite < 3.9.0
Description
	 
		(last modified by Tim Graham)
	 
Indexes on expressions (see #26167) and the SQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1 compile-time option are supported on ​SQLite 3.9.0+.
Ubuntu Xenial ships with SQLite 3.11.0 (which will still by supported by Django) and will EOL in April 2021. Debian Jessie ships with 3.8.7 and was EOL June 30, 2020.
SQLite 3.9.0 was released in October 2015. SQLite version support seems like a similar situation as GEOS libraries which we generally support about 5 years after released.

</ISSUE>


A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
The program aims to check if the SQLite version being used by Django is less than 3.9.0 and raises an `AssertionError` in such a case. However, the code execution makes a successful exit, indicating that the SQLite version meets the requirements (3.9.0 or higher). The trace does not explicitly show abnormal behavior related to SQLite version checking, since the version reported is higher than 3.9.0 (`3.47.2`).

This indicates that the logic used to check the version is functioning correctly given the SQLite version observed during execution. There might be a potential issue if it were to fail under different circumstances with an older SQLite version but based on the provided trace output, there's no indication of a current bug.

Since we don't have an indication of failure, and the observed behavior seems correct, let’s define the next step based on ensuring that we are covering the implemented logic effectively within the method itself.

Observed method: `reproduce.py:check_sqlite_version`
==================================================
Based on the observation and the provided information, let's analyze the current situation regarding the `check_sqlite_version` method:

1. **Purpose**: The `check_sqlite_version` method aims to verify that the SQLite version being used is 3.9.0 or higher. If the version is lower, it raises an `AssertionError`.

2. **Current Functionality**:
   - Retrieves the SQLite version using `cursor.execute("SELECT sqlite_version();")`.
   - Checks the version against the required minimum (3.9.0).

3. **Observed Output**:
   - The retrieved SQLite version is `3.47.2`.
   - The comparison seems erroneous; it uses `sqlite3.sqlite_version_info` instead of comparing with the fetched version stored in `sqlite_version`.

**Abnormal Behavior**: This method is checking the SQLite version via the `sqlite3` module's `sqlite_version_info` attribute, which returns the version of the SQLite C library that Python was compiled against, rather than the version of SQLite used by Django. This mismatch might lead to incorrect results if the SQLite version used by the database is not the one the Python library binds to.

The issue lies in the comparison mechanism, which should involve the fetched version as opposed to `sqlite3.sqlite_version_info`.

**Next Step**: 
Further investigate if there have been any discrepancies in how versions are being reported or any other implicit code paths that overlook the fetched SQLite version. 

If you need to deeper observe the comparison logic, please select the relevant lines:

- **Observed scope**: `reproduce.py:27-31`

This selection will help confirm the logical path of how version comparison is handled and ensure that there are no other implicit paths impacting this comparison that we haven’t already covered.
==================================================
Based on the code snippet and runtime information provided, we observe the following:

1. The `check_sqlite_version()` method is designed to check if the SQLite version used by Django is less than 3.9.0, and it raises an `AssertionError` if that condition is met.

2. The information logged shows that the SQLite version used by Django (`sqlite_version`) is `3.47.2`, which is indeed greater than 3.9.0.

3. The line `if sqlite3.sqlite_version_info < (3, 9, 0):` is the key comparison that determines whether to raise an error. However, this comparison checks the SQLite version of the Python library (`sqlite3.sqlite_version_info`) instead of the version obtained from the database through the cursor (`sqlite_version`).

4. There is thus a discrepancy between the variables being used for the comparison. The `sqlite_version_info` may not be the version directly used by the Django setup, thus leading to potential mismatches.

**Root cause analysis**:
- The method is incorrectly checking the version using `sqlite3.sqlite_version_info` when it should check against the retrieved `sqlite_version`. This might not align with the actual version Django is interacting with if the database version fetched differs from what the Python SQLite bindings were built against.

Given these observations, the logic that handles version checking within the `check_sqlite_version` method in the script appears to be flawed due to using the wrong variable for the actual version check.

Thus, the buggy code is located in:

```python
if sqlite3.sqlite_version_info < (3, 9, 0):
```

This should instead use `sqlite_version` to match the actual database version:

```python
if tuple(map(int, sqlite_version.split('.'))) < (3, 9, 0):
```

Therefore, we can precisely locate the buggy method as follows:

Buggy method: `reproduce.py:check_sqlite_version`

    # Get the SQLite version used by Django
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT sqlite_version();")
    sqlite_version = cursor.fetchone()[0]
    print(f"SQLite version used by Django: {sqlite_version}")

    # Check if the SQLite version is less than 3.9.0
    if sqlite3.sqlite_version_info < (3, 9, 0):
        e = AssertionError(f"SQLite version {sqlite_version} is less than 3.9.0, which is not supported.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e

```


==================================================

Your Output:
We have successfully retrieved the relevant source code for the `check_sqlite_version` method in the `reproduce.py` file. This provides all the necessary details to generate the required patch for fixing the version check issue.

Let's proceed to generate the patch to address the issue where the incorrect variable is used for SQLite version comparison.

Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

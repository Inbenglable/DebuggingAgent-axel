In the provided code snippet, we have a simplified version of an unparser in the `_UnparseVisitor` class, which is a subclass of `ast.NodeVisitor`. The class is used to transform an abstract syntax tree (AST) back into a string representation of code. However, the code specifically about visiting tuples, which is likely the source of the bug, is not shown in the snippet we have.

Given the context of the issue, the problem lies in how a single-element tuple like `(1,)` is visited and subsequently converted to a string. This is usually handled by a visit method specifically for tuple nodes (typically like `visit_Tuple`) that would ensure the tuple's string representation includes the trailing comma for single-element tuples.

There is currently no observation of such a method in the snippet provided. Therefore, the next step involves tracing into such a method that deals with visiting tuples within the `_UnparseVisitor`.

Observed method: `sphinx/pycode/ast.py:_UnparseVisitor.visit_Tuple`

The patch attempted to modify the `_multi_decorate` function in the `django/utils/decorators.py` file to ensure that function-like attributes are preserved when interacting with `functools.partial`. Specifically, it tried to:

1. Import `wraps` from `functools`.
2. Replace the `partial` object for `bound_method` with a direct method binding wrapped by `wraps`.

However, after applying the patch, the `PATCHED OUTPUT` shows that there is an `IndentationError: expected an indented block`. This indicates that there is a problem with the code indentation in the patched file, which prevents the program from running correctly.

Due to this syntax error, the test after applying the patch did not run successfully. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether the logic introduced by the patch would have resolved the issue, as the test did not execute the relevant code.

Based on the `PATCHED OUTPUT` showing a syntax error — specifically an `IndentationError` — the issue is not resolved because the code does not run correctly to even test the logic.

Issue resolved: `False`

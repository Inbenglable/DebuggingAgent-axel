Let's evaluate the API returned contents to determine whether they are relevant to resolving the issue:

#### sympy/physics/units/quantities.py:Quantity._collect_factor_and_dimension
- This content refers to a deprecated method, `Quantity._collect_factor_and_dimension()`, which points to using the method from the `UnitSystem` class instead. While it mentions _collect_factor_and_dimension(), it indicates that this method is no longer being used and suggests checking the relevant method in `UnitSystem`. Thus, this file is not necessary for resolving the current issue.

#### sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py:UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension
- This is the implementation of the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method in the `UnitSystem` class, which is directly relevant to the issue. The logic within this method is responsible for determining dimensions and scaling factors within expressions, including handling Expressions with `Mul`, `Pow`, `Add`, etc. Furthermore, it includes logic for handling dimension detection within functions, which seems pertinent to the issue with dimensionless exponent handling mentioned in the bug report. We will need to review this method's implementation to understand why dimensionless exponents are not being correctly identified.

The relevant content needed to address the issue:

```
sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py:UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension
```

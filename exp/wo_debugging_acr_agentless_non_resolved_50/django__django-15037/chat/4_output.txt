To address the issue of handling foreign keys to specific fields in the `inspectdb` management command, I need to inspect how the `Command.get_field_type` method is utilized and potentially modified to accommodate this foreign key reference issue. We've identified that `get_field_type` is located in `django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py`.

However, we also need to understand how foreign key constraints are introspected and translated into Django model fields, specifically how `inspectdb` manages these references. We should look into related methods or functions that could influence or manage the introspection of foreign keys beyond `get_field_type`.

I'll proceed by retrieving the source code for `Command.get_field_type` and potentially other related methods within the `inspectdb` file to better understand how to make the necessary adjustments.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py", "get_field_type")
search_method_in_file("django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py", "handle_inspection")
search_method_in_codebase("add_fk")
search_method_in_codebase("introspect")
```

To generate a patch for this issue, I need to check the full implementation of the `SQLiteSchemaEditor.add_field` method in the `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py` file. I want to confirm the code around the `_remake_table` method and understand if there's any existing condition or logic I might leverage or modify. Let's retrieve the `add_field` method's full code to analyze it better.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py", "add_field")
```

To resolve the reported issue, I need to examine the `get_resolver` method in Django's URL resolver module. This is because the proposed solution involves modifying the `get_resolver` function to cache based directly on `settings.ROOT_URLCONF`. Additionally, I might need to understand the context, namely the `set_urlconf` function and relevant settings handling. 

Therefore, I will first retrieve the source code for the `get_resolver` method to understand its current implementation, as well as any surrounding context that pertains to caching and handling URLs.

I'll proceed with the following actions:
1. Search for the `get_resolver` method in the codebase since the file is not specified.
2. Search for `set_urlconf` in case its usage is needed.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("get_resolver")
search_method_in_codebase("set_urlconf")
```

To resolve the issue, I need to inspect the implementation details within the `Columns` class related to suffix handling and SQL formatting. Specifically, I should examine the `__init__` method signature and the `__str__` method, as these likely influence the formatting of CREATE INDEX statements.

I'll begin by retrieving the source code for both the `__init__` and `__str__` methods in the `Columns` class from `django/db/backends/ddl_references.py`.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/ddl_references.py", "Columns.__init__")
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/ddl_references.py", "Columns.__str__")
```

To resolve the reported issue in the `trim_docstring` function, we need to adjust the logic for calculating indentation. Specifically, we will skip the first line when determining the minimum indentation. Here's the patch to implement the proposed fix:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())\n=======\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
``` 

This patch updates the `trim_docstring` function to correctly handle docstrings where text starts on the first line without introducing errors.

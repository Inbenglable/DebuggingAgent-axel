The current focus is on the `_split_gcd` function defined in `sympy/simplify/radsimp.py`. The function intends to split a list of integers into two lists based on whether they are divisible by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the list. However, the `IndexError` arises when this logic encounters an unexpected situation, likely an empty input or improperly processed list.

### Key observations:
- The line `g = a[0]` at line 1116 assumes that the list `a` is non-empty. If `a` is empty, this line will raise an `IndexError`.
- The function receives its input (`*a`) from upstream processing. Understanding how `a` is determined will help identify why it could be empty or improperly constructed.

Given the context, it's crucial to understand how `a` is generated in its upstream logic, specifically in how the `split_surds` function processes and constructs its arguments for `_split_gcd`.

### Conclusion:
To identify the root cause, we need to observe how `_split_gcd` is invoked and what causes `a` to be empty. Tracing the execution in the `split_surds` function, which calls `_split_gcd`, is the logical next step.

### Next step:
Observe the code in `split_surds` leading to `_split_gcd` to identify how the arguments are formed.

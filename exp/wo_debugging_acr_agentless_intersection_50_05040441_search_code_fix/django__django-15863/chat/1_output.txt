In order to fix the issue related to the `floatformat` template filter dropping precision for `Decimal` numbers, it's essential to first review the existing implementation of the `floatformat` filter in the Django codebase. This will help identify the exact code responsible for converting `Decimal` numbers to `float`, leading to precision loss.

Since I need to check the implementation of the `floatformat` filter, I need to retrieve the source code for this method. Since the method name is `floatformat`, I will perform a search in the Django codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("floatformat")
```

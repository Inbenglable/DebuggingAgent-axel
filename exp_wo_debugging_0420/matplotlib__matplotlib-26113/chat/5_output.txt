To address the issue, I need to retrieve the source code relevant to the `hexbin` method in the **matplotlib** project's codebase. The bug report provides specific file locations in the source code where the `mincnt` parameter is handled differently depending on the presence of the `C` parameter. Therefore, I will check those sections of the code to understand the current implementation and propose a consistent behavior.

Let's proceed by searching for the existing source code at these locations.

```python
search_code_in_file("lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py", "mincnt")
search_method_in_codebase("hexbin")
```

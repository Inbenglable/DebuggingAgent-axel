To address the issue of making the `element_id` argument of `json_script` optional, we need to focus on the function that contains the logic for handling this argument. Let's analyze the returned content:

1. **django/template/defaultfilters.py:json_script:**
   - This function is a wrapper for the `_json_script` function, calling it with `value` and `element_id`. The specifics of how the `element_id` is handled are not clear from this snippet. The actual logic for creating the script tag seems to be elsewhere.

2. **django/utils/html.py:json_script:**
   - This function contains the core logic for generating the `<script>` tag with the JSON-encoded value. The `element_id` is used directly in the `format_html()` function, suggesting this is where the change to making `element_id` optional would need to occur.

Given this analysis, the relevant content we need is from the file that directly manipulates the `element_id` in the script generation:

```
django/utils/html.py:json_script
```

To address the issue related to `ax.clear()` in the Matplotlib library with shared axes, we need to identify the portion of the codebase where `ax.clear()` is implemented. It's likely within the matplotlib.axes module, typically in a class related to the Axes. Since the problem seems to involve the behavior of the ticks and their labels, we need to find where the `clear()` method is located and examine its implementation to understand how it handles ticks, tick labels, and any shared axis properties.

Let's begin by searching for the `clear` method within the context of an Axis-related class in the Matplotlib codebase:

```python
search_method_in_codebase("clear")
```

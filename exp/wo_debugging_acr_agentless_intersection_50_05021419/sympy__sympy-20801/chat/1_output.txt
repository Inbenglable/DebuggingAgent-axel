To resolve the issue described, I need to understand how the `S` function, which is likely responsible for handling the SymPy expressions for `0.0` and `False`, operates internally. This will help identify where the comparison logic might need adjustment. Consequently, I need to retrieve the source code related to the `S` function and any relevant comparison operators in the SymPy project.

Since the issue mentions comparison between `S(0.0)` and `S.false`, the `S` function and any relevant comparison logic need to be examined. Given that I'm not provided with specific file paths, I'll need to search the codebase for the function `S`.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("S")
```

#### ISSUE
caplog fixture doesn't restore log level after test
From the documentation at https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.0.0/logging.html#caplog-fixture, "The log levels set are restored automatically at the end of the test".
It used to work, but looks broken in new 6.0 release. Minimal example to reproduce:

```
def test_foo(caplog):
    caplog.set_level(42)

def test_bar(caplog):
    print(caplog.handler.level)
```

It prints "0" for pytest<6, "42" after.

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
The provided code demonstrates an issue with the `caplog` fixture where the log level is not correctly restored after a test. The key evidence to this problem is observed in the test output where the log level remains at 42, even at the beginning of the second test (`test_bar`), where it should have been reset to 0.

Here's the breakdown:

1. In `test_foo`, the log level is set to 42, as confirmed by the print statement and the assertion.
2. `test_bar` is executed afterward, and the log level should have been reset to the initial value (0), but it is not; it remains at 42. This indicates that the fixture is not restoring the initial log level after a test, which is contrary to the documentation.

To trace the bug, we need to observe how the `caplog` fixture is supposed to reset its state between tests.

Next, I will inspect the method `set_level` in the `_pytest/logging.py` file, which manages the log level setting and saving of initial states. Let's observe whether it restores the log level as expected after each test.

Observed method: `src/_pytest/logging.py:LogCaptureFixture.set_level`
==================================================
Analyzing the current observed code and abnormal program behavior:

1. The method `LogCaptureFixture.set_level` is designed to save the original log level and set a new log level. At line 435, the original log level is stored in `self._initial_logger_levels` using the logger as the key.
2. The log level is then set to the new level, both for the logger object and the handler.

The problem behavior happens after the execution of `set_level`, where the log level does not revert to its original state in subsequent tests. 
Examining the method, the missing part seems to be the restoration logic for the saved log levels.

To confirm and resolve the restoration logic:
We need to delve into the teardown mechanism responsible for restoring original log levels after test completion and ensure that `set_level`'s saved state gets restored appropriately.

Next, let's observe the code responsible for test teardown. This is likely in `_finalize` method or similar teardown logic.

Observed scope: `src/_pytest/logging.py:438-460`

Note: The teardown mechanism typically initializes after test completion, ensuring the state is restored between tests.
==================================================
From the information provided, it appears that the `at_level` context manager is responsible for temporarily setting and restoring the log level, but the problem is related to the `set_level` and `_finalize` methods not correctly saving and restoring this state between test executions.

### Analysis:
1. The `at_level` context manager shows expected behavior by setting and restoring the log level correctly within a `with` block, but this does not automatically apply to `set_level`.
2. The abnormal behavior is that the log level is not restored after setting it in one test and moving to the next, resulting in test setup contamination.
3. The root cause likely lies in how the `caplog` machinery manipulates the log level outside the `with` block, specifically in how levels are persisted or reset after test execution.
4. A potential culprit mechanism could be `_finalize` within the `LogCaptureFixture` class that may be responsible for post-test state cleanup and needs to ensure the reset of the log level.

Having reviewed the context and mechanics around temporary log level changes, the absence or malfunction in restoration logic around `set_level` is a focal point. Before finalizing, `_finalize` should be observed to confirm if the state capture and restoration mechanism is correctly implemented or not.

Observed method: `src/_pytest/logging.py:LogCaptureFixture._finalize`
==================================================
### Analysis of Current Observed Code and Abnormal Behavior:

The `LogCaptureFixture._finalize` method is intended to restore log levels when a test completes. It does this by iterating over a dictionary (`self._initial_logger_levels`) where loggers' original levels are stored and resetting them accordingly. 

### Observed Runtime Information:
1. The `logger_name` is `None`, which suggests an issue with how the logging levels are saved and restored.
2. The `setLevel` function is called correctly, but it seems the captured logger (in this test case the root logger) still retains the log level set in the prior test despite `_finalize` logic.
3. This confirms that the `self._initial_logger_levels` dictionary is not correctly capturing or restoring logs due to improper key assignments (using `None`).

### Abnormal Behavior Summary:
- The log level preservation/restoration mechanism does not work as expected due to the incorrect key-value storage method or assignment in `self._initial_logger_levels`.

### Next Steps:
The issue likely resides within how `self._initial_logger_levels` is populated or manipulated during log level change. Re-evaluation of `set_level` or related setup code is critical to ensure that the logger names are correctly recorded and restored.

Now, let's delve deeper into how `self._initial_logger_levels` is managed to understand how these levels are recorded, particularly during the `set_level` function call.

#### Observed Scope
Observed scope: `src/_pytest/logging.py:430-450`
==================================================
### Analysis of Current Observed Code and Abnormal Behavior:

The `LogCaptureFixture.set_level` method is where the log level is set and stored for restoration. The critical part observed is:

- The `logger_obj` correctly captures the root logger.
- The `original level` of the logger is stored in `self._initial_logger_levels` with the key being the logger name.
- The logger and handler levels are then set to the new level (42).

### Abnormal Behavior Summary:
- In the runtime information, the root logger's original level is stored under the key `None`. This is problematic since it does not correctly map the original level with identifiable keys.
- This incorrect key usage causes `_finalize` after the test to ineffectively restore the log levels, thereby failing to reset them correctly.

This suggests that the bug resides in how the log levels are stored against incorrect keys (`None`) in `self._initial_logger_levels`.

### Next Steps:
Based on this perspective, the improper dictionary key assignment in `self._initial_logger_levels` causes restoration issues. Addressing the key assignment mechanism or logic within the `set_level` function is necessary.

This analysis indicates that `LogCaptureFixture.set_level` is the buggy method where the issue occurs due to improper key assignments.

Buggy method: `src/_pytest/logging.py:LogCaptureFixture.set_level`
==================================================


Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

### IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

### IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

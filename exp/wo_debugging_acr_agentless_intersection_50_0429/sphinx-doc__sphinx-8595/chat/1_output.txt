In order to resolve the issue, I need to find how Sphinx's `autodoc` extension currently processes the `__all__` attribute. I'll start by looking for relevant methods that handle or decide which members to include in the documentation of a module, particularly focusing on the use or checking of the `__all__` attribute. 

I will begin by searching for classes and methods that are likely responsible for handling `autodoc` functionality in Sphinx.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Documenter")
search_method_in_codebase("get_object_members")
```

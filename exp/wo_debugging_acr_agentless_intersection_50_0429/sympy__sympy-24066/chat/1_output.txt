To resolve the issue, we need to review the source code of the `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension()` method. This method is in charge of returning the dimension, and it seems not correctly identifying the dimensionless aspect of certain expressions. I need to retrieve this method's source code first.

Additionally, since the issue mentions the dimension handling of expressions involving `exp`, reviewing how dimensions are handled in general in the `SI` class might be necessary. Therefore, I will first search for the method `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension()` and check its implementation.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("SI._collect_factor_and_dimension")
```

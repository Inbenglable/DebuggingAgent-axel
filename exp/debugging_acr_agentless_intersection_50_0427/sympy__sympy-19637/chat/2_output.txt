To resolve the issue, I need to look at the implementation of the `kernS` function in the `sympy/core/sympify.py` file to understand how the `kern` variable is supposed to be used and initialized. Therefore, I will retrieve the source code of the `kernS` method.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/core/sympify.py", "kernS")
```

Based on the current analysis, we need to retrieve the implementation of the `ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members` method to understand how the `__all__` attribute is handled and modify the code accordingly.

The method `get_object_members` appears to be responsible for determining which members should be included, and this is where the condition to check for an empty `__all__` should be added.

Let's use the `search_method_in_file` API to retrieve the source code of this method and review its implementation.

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py", "ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members")
```

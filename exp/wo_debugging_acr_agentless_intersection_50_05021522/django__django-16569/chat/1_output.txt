To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code for the `add_fields` method in the `django/forms/formsets.py` file. This will allow me to analyze the code surrounding the problematic comparison and apply the suggested fix.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/forms/formsets.py", "BaseFormSet.add_fields")
```

Here is the patch to address the issue with non-monotonic coordinates in the `combine_by_coords` function from the xarray project:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### xarray/core/combine.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                    raise ValueError(\"Resulting object does not have monotonic\"\n                                     \" global indexes along dimension {}\"\n                                     .format(dim))\n=======\n                    if combined_ids is not None:  # Only check if there's something to combine\n                        raise ValueError(\"Resulting object does not have monotonic\"\n                                         \" global indexes along dimension {}\"\n                                         .format(dim))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Condition Update**: The condition checking monotonic global indexes is updated to ensure that the datasets must exhibit non-monotonicity for concatenation to proceed. This allows the function to bypass any erroneously identified non-issues which arise when the coordinate dimension is identical across datasets.

These changes focus on addressing the issue where non-varying identical coordinate dimensions erroneously raise a `ValueError`. The patch should resolve this without compromise to the original functionality of `combine_by_coords`.

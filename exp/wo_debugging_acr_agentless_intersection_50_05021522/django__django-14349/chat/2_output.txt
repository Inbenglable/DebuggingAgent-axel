Based on the information provided, I need to examine the `__call__` method of the `URLValidator` class to understand its implementation, as this is potentially the place where URL validation is happening and where we might need to adjust our logic to account for the forbidden characters (LF, CR, and tabs).

Let's retrieve the source code of the `__call__` method from the `URLValidator` class in the `django/core/validators.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/validators.py", "URLValidator.__call__")
```

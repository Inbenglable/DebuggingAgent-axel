To resolve the issue, I need to review the source code for the `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` classes as well as the methods `get_current_timezone_name()` and `TimeZoneMixin`. These are crucial to ensure the proper incorporation of the `tzinfo` parameter. 

I'll start by retrieving the source code for the relevant classes and functions in the file `django/db/models/functions/datetime.py`.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncDate")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncTime")
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "get_current_timezone_name")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TimeZoneMixin")
```

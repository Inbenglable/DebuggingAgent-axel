Based on the gathered information, we have identified:
- The `verbose` option in `base_options.py` is using `_DoNothingAction`, which seems incorrect given the context of the issue.
- There is a `short` value `v` for the `verbose` option which raises the possibility of wrong handling or setting.
- The `--verbose` long option directly sets the verbose mode using `_set_verbose_mode` in the `utils.py`.

To address the short option `-v` behavior, we should ensure it doesn't require an argument and properly sets the verbose mode similar to the `--verbose` long option. This might involve making modifications to how the `verbose` option is processed or the actions associated with it.

Before generating the patch, I want to further confirm the behavior and ensure that it doesn't require any additional setup elsewhere. I will check the `_DoNothingAction` definition to see if we need to adjust this for the `verbose` short option.

```python
search_class_in_file("pylint/lint/base_options.py", "_DoNothingAction")
```

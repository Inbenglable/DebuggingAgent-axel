To address the issue specified, I need to review the existing implementation in the `django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py` file, specifically around line 102. This will help ensure we understand the current logic and confirm that the additional permissions check aligns with the existing functionality.

Let's retrieve the source code around the specified line to understand the context and make the necessary adjustment.

```python
search_code_in_file("django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py", "show_save_as_new")
```

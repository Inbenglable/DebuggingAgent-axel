To resolve the issue, I need to inspect the full source code of the `_TR56` method in the `sympy/simplify/fu.py` file to understand the comparisons and apply corrections. This examination will allow me to generate a patch.

I'll move ahead to retrieve the source code for `_TR56`:

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/simplify/fu.py", "_TR56")
```

To evaluate whether the issue is resolved, let's break down the details of what happened:

1. **Original Issue**: The `ModelChoiceField` did not include the invalid choice in the error message when a `ValidationError` was raised.

2. **Proposed Changes**: 
   - The patch included adding `'%(value)s'` to the `invalid_choice` error message in the `ModelChoiceField`. This change ensures that the error message will display the invalid choice value.

3. **Test Setup Issues**: 
   - Both the original and patched outputs show a `ModuleNotFoundError` for 'reproducer'. This indicates a problem with the test setup environment, namely, the absence of a module or settings module called 'reproducer'.
   - Due to this setup error, the tests designed to check whether the patch fixed the actual issue in the `ModelChoiceField` were not even executed.

4. **Conclusion**: 
   - Since tests did not run due to the unrelated module setup issue, we cannot definitively say if the patch resolves the original issue.
   - The lack of test execution means there's no validation against the original problem.

**Issue resolved**: `False` 

Since the environment setup prevented the test from running, the solution's effectiveness has not been verified within this context. You'll need to fix the environment issues first to properly test the patch.

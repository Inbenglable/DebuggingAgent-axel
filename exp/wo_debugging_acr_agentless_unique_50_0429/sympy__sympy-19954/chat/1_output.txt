To resolve the issue, I need to examine the `sylow_subgroup` method in the `PermGroup` class from the `perm_groups.py` file since the error traceback indicates the problem is within this method. Additionally, I need to review the `minimal_blocks` method, which is directly mentioned in the traceback. Knowing the context of the `minimal_blocks` implementation will help in understanding why the `IndexError` is being raised. 

Let's search for these methods in the appropriate file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/perm_groups.py", "PermGroup.sylow_subgroup")
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/perm_groups.py", "PermGroup.minimal_blocks")
```

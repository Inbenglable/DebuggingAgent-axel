I need to retrieve more of the surrounding code in the `astropy/table/table.py` file to understand the relevant context for adding a `FutureWarning` and planning for future changes. Specifically, I want to confirm the logic before and after the identified transformation section.

```python
search_code_in_file("astropy/table/table.py", "Structured ndarray gets viewed as a mixin unless already a valid")
search_code_in_file("astropy/table/table.py", "data = data.view(NdarrayMixin)")
```

To address the reported issue regarding unnecessary SQL JOINs due to multiple search fields in the Django admin changelist query, I need to retrieve and review the source code for the `get_queryset` method, which is responsible for constructing the query in Django's admin interface.

As the debugging history encompasses issues related to Django's admin panel, including the execution and filtering of queries influenced by the presence of JOINs in search fields within the admin model, it makes logical sense to inspect the construction of querysets within the admin options to minimize unnecessary joins.

Before generating a patch, I'll first obtain the source code of the relevant classes and methods. Specifically, I need to look into the `ModelAdmin` class and its `get_queryset` method. These are involved when the admin generates the query for filtering and searching data.

Let's retrieve the source code for the `get_queryset` method in the `ModelAdmin` class and any relevant classes.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ModelAdmin")
search_method_in_codebase("get_queryset")
```

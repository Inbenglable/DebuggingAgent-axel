To generate the patch, I need to understand how `datetime_cast_date_sql` and `datetime_cast_time_sql` operate, as these functions are responsible for handling the SQL generation using the timezone name. I need to ensure that these functions can accept the `tzinfo` parameter.

Therefore, I will retrieve the definitions of those functions to verify their current implementation and how they handle the `tzname` parameter.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("datetime_cast_date_sql")
search_method_in_codebase("datetime_cast_time_sql")
```

Based on the retrieved source code of the `SQLDeleteCompiler.as_sql` method, we have sufficient information to generate the patch. The method's current implementation creates an unnecessary subquery for delete operations, leading to performance regression. To resolve this, we should modify the logic to conditionally use the straightforward `DELETE FROM <table>` SQL statement when the entire table is being deleted.

Hence, we're ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

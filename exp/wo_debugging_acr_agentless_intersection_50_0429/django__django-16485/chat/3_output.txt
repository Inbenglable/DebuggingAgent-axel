To resolve the issue where `floatformat()` crashes on "0.00" with a `ValueError`, we need to modify the part of the code that sets the precision in the `floatformat` function. The precision should not be lower than 1, which is consistent with the Decimal module's constraints. Here's the patch to fix the issue:

```pythony
### django/template/defaultfilters.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    prec = abs(p) + units + 1
=======
    prec = max(1, abs(p) + units + 1)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's format the edit into JSON as requested.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/template/defaultfilters.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    prec = abs(p) + units + 1\n=======\n    prec = max(1, abs(p) + units + 1)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

To address the issue regarding setting default `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` to `0o644`, we need to identify the relevant parts of the Django codebase that involve file upload permissions. Let's analyze each API returned content to determine relevance:

1. **tests/test_utils/tests.py:1100-1106**: This section is part of test cases where `default_storage.file_permissions_mode` is being used and tested against different settings. It helps in verifying the effect of `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`, but doesn’t contribute directly to changing the default setting.

2. **tests/staticfiles_tests/test_storage.py:529-535**: This section tests `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` through overriding settings. Again, it's useful for understanding test scenarios but not for changing default values.

3. **tests/file_storage/tests.py:892-898**: This also involves a test scenario where file upload default permissions are checked. Provides insight into testing the defaults but does not modify the setting.

4. **django/core/files/storage.py:214-220**: Here we see code in the storage module that actually involves a value retrieval from `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`. This is an important piece as it looks into the actual setting of file permissions through Django’s mechanisms.

5. **django/conf/global_settings.py:304-310**: This is where `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` default is currently set to `None`. Changing it here would directly impact the default setting for file upload permissions.

The most relevant sections for changing the default `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` to `0o644` are those that define or use this setting in the core functionality of Django.

Based on this analysis, we need these lines:

```
django/core/files/storage.py:214-220
django/conf/global_settings.py:304-310
```

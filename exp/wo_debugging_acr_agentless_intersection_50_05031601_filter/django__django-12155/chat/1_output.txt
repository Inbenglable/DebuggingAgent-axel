Based on the issue description, the problem is within the `trim_docstring` method which is responsible for processing docstrings. I need to retrieve its source code to assess its logic and generate the required patch.

Since the file path for the `trim_docstring` method was not specified, I will search for it in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("trim_docstring")
```

To determine whether the issue is fixed, let's review the patch and analyze the test output before and after the patch:

**Patch Review:**

The patch modifies the `_safe_first_finite` function in the `cbook` module to handle cases where all elements are non-finite. The modification is intended to prevent a `StopIteration` exception and instead return `np.nan` when no finite values are found.

**Test Output Analysis:**

- **Original Output:** The original output shows a `StopIteration` exception occurring when `ax.bar([np.nan], [np.nan])` is executed, indicating the bug in attempting to find the first finite value in the presence of all `np.nan` values.

- **Patched Output:** The patched output shows an error related to processing a line in the `matplotlib-nspkg.pth` file, but it doesn't show the `StopIteration` exception that was present in the original output. This suggests that the change in `_safe_first_finite` might have mitigated the issue of the `StopIteration` exception, although the environment error is not directly related to the specific bug discussed.

However, the patched output does not confirm that calling `ax.bar([np.nan], [np.nan])` results in a `BarCollection` with the expected behavior (as described in the bug report), nor does it confirm whether the `ax.bar` call executes without any exception related to the bug.

**Conclusion:**

Because the patched output does not provide conclusive evidence that the bug related to `StopIteration` has been fully resolved in terms of functionality (i.e., returning a collection with `nan` values), additional tests and environment setup would be needed to verify the solution fully. Additionally, the remaining error related to the environment could be a side effect of testing or development setup but does not directly relate to the bug itself from what is provided.

Therefore, based on available evidence in the test outputs:

Issue resolved: `False`

To resolve the issue with the `units.quantity_input` decorator in the `astropy` project, I need to understand the implementation of this decorator to identify how it handles annotated return values and consequently adjust it to accommodate the `None` type hint in constructors. Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code of the `quantity_input` method.

Additionally, from the traceback information, it seems the file `astropy/units/decorators.py` is involved in the error, so starting by searching in this file is reasonable.

```python
search_code_in_file("astropy/units/decorators.py", "quantity_input")
```

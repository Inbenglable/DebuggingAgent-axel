To resolve this issue, I need to understand how the `hist` method interacts with `density` and `range` inside its respective implementation in the Matplotlib library. The "hist" method in 'lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py' is essentially a wrapper that delegates to the `hist` method of another object, presumably a `Axes` object.

Therefore, I need to locate the source code for the `hist` method within the relevant class, likely located in the Matplotlib library's core files. I will perform a search to determine how this function is implemented in the underlying class.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("Axes.hist")
```

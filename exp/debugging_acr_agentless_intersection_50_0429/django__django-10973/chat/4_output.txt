To generate the patch, I need to obtain the source code for the `DatabaseClient.runshell_db` method from the specified file path `django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py`. This will allow me to refactor the code by replacing the temporary `.pgpass` file handling with the direct use of the `PGPASSWORD` environment variable via `subprocess.run`. 

Let's retrieve the source code for this method:

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py", "DatabaseClient.runshell_db")
```

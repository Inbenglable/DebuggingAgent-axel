To resolve the issue, I need to examine the `_prepare_then_do_arithmetic` method, which is invoked by `NDArithmeticMixin.multiply`. Understanding how this method handles mask propagation during arithmetic operations is key to addressing the bug.

I'll search for the `_prepare_then_do_arithmetic` method in the `astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py` file to gather more details.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py", "_prepare_then_do_arithmetic")
```

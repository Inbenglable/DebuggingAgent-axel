## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Migration crashes deleting an index_together if there is a unique_together on the same fields
Description
	
Happens with Django 1.11.10
Steps to reproduce:
1) Create models with 2 fields, add 2 same fields to unique_together and to index_together
2) Delete index_together -> Fail
It will fail at django/db/backends/base/schema.py, line 378, in _delete_composed_index(), ValueError: Found wrong number (2) of constraints for as this one will find two constraints, the _uniq and the _idx one. No way to get out of this...
The worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the "new" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.
I think there are 2 different points here:
1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together
2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To address this issue, I need to inspect the `_delete_composed_index` method which is located in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` as mentioned in the problem description. This will help me understand how it handles the index and unique constraints and identify what needs to be fixed. Therefore, I will retrieve the source code of the `_delete_composed_index` method.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "_delete_composed_index")
```

    def _delete_composed_index(self, model, fields, constraint_kwargs, sql):
        meta_constraint_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.constraints}
        meta_index_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.indexes}
        columns = [model._meta.get_field(field).column for field in fields]
        constraint_names = self._constraint_names(
            model, columns, exclude=meta_constraint_names | meta_index_names,
            **constraint_kwargs
        )
        if len(constraint_names) != 1:
            raise ValueError("Found wrong number (%s) of constraints for %s(%s)" % (
                len(constraint_names),
                model._meta.db_table,
                ", ".join(columns),
            ))
        self.execute(self._delete_constraint_sql(sql, model, constraint_names[0]))

```


==================================================

Your Output:
In order to resolve the issue, I need to understand the context of how the `_delete_composed_index` method is being invoked and used within the Django migration framework. Specifically, I need to determine where the method is called to identify any caller's behavior that might affect how the constraints are handled. This information would be valuable for designing an appropriate fix. Therefore, I need to search for occurrences of `_delete_composed_index` in the codebase to locate calls and inspect their context.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("_delete_composed_index")
```

==================================================

Your Output:
To generate a patch for this issue, I need to gather more context on how constraints are managed around the `_delete_composed_index` method and possibly inspect methods like `_constraint_names`, which assists in identifying constraints that need to be deleted. This method is crucial for understanding why multiple constraints are being identified. So, I'll begin by retrieving the source code for `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor._constraint_names` method. Once I have this, I'll be able to generate the necessary patch with comprehensive understanding.

search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor._constraint_names")

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

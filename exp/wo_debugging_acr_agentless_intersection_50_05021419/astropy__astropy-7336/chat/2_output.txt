To fix the reported issue, the most effective solution would involve investigating the `wrapper` function in `astropy.units.decorators.py` where the error occurs. The error traceback shows that the issue resides in the line:

```python
return return_.to(wrapped_signature.return_annotation)
```

This suggests that the function is attempting to use the `to` method on `None`, which leads to the exception. To fix this, we would need to ensure that a return value of `None` doesn't undergo unit conversion.

To proceed, I will search for the `wrapper` function in the `astropy/units/decorators.py` file, since the error is occurring there, to better understand how to apply the fix.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/units/decorators.py", "wrapper")
```

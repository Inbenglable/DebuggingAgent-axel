To resolve this issue, we need to modify the `django.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments` method to correctly determine when Python was started with the `-m` switch and with a package other than `django`. Before generating a patch, I need to retrieve the source code for the `get_child_arguments` method from the Django codebase so we can properly implement the change.

I'll search for the `get_child_arguments` method in the Django project codebase to gather the necessary information.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("get_child_arguments")
```

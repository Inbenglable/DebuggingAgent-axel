Given the context of the issue and the runtime information, it appears that the error prevents the `dbgsnooper` tool from functioning correctly due to an assertion failure related to file path existence.

The provided code snippet from `diophantine` reflects a logic responsible for permutations based on the equations and symbol orders. The logic checks conditions for permutations based on the equation type and variable coefficients.

The issue with differing outputs based on the symbol order seems to be closely tied to the permutation logic, particularly how permutations are handled in lines 206-350. The inconsistency points to potential problems in how permutations are implemented, especially when signs and variable orders might affect the final solution set.

Given these factors, and without further runtime errors inhibiting code introspection, the buggy method is likely within:

Buggy method: `sympy/solvers/diophantine.py:diophantine`

To determine if the issue is resolved, let's review the provided information and actions:

1. **Understanding the Issue**: The issue requires adding DISTINCT support to the `Avg` and `Sum` aggregate classes in Django.

2. **Reproduce Test**: The test provided attempts to use the `distinct` parameter with the `Avg`, `Sum`, `Min`, and `Max` aggregates and expects an exception for each because the functionality is currently not supported.

3. **Original Output**: The error message "Apps aren't loaded yet." indicates a configuration or setup issue with Django models, rather than directly relating to DISTINCT support in the aggregates. It means the Django environment wasn't properly set up before the test was executed.

4. **Patch Review**: The patch adds an `allow_distinct = True` to the `Avg` and `Sum` classes to enable DISTINCT functionality. However, without fixing the underlying configuration issue in the test code, it's impossible to verify if these changes successfully introduce support for the DISTINCT parameter.

5. **Test Output After the Patch**: The output remains unchanged. The configuration issue persists, indicating that Django's application registry is still not properly set up in the test environment. Therefore, the patch hasn't been effectively tested in fulfilling its intended purpose (due to initialization problems), and we can't conclude if the patch resolves the actual issue described.

**Conclusion**: Since the underlying test suite was unable to execute correctly in both the original and patched environments, and no testing of DISTINCT functionality occurred, we cannot determine if the issue was resolved with this patch. The test does not execute as intended due to setup errors.

Issue resolved: `False`

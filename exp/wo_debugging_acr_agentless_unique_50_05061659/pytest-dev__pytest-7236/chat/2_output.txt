To address the issue, we need to determine how pytest processes test lifecycle events, particularly the interaction between the unittest framework and pytest's handling of test lifecycle events when the `--pdb` option is used. We have two relevant entries from the search results:

1. `#### src/_pytest/hookspec.py:pytest_runtest_call`: This entry provides the hook specification for `pytest_runtest_call` but does not contain implementation details or any specific logic that could affect the behavior we're investigating. Therefore, this file is likely not relevant.

2. `#### src/_pytest/runner.py:pytest_runtest_call`: This entry is significant because it contains the implementation of `pytest_runtest_call`, which is responsible for executing the test item, managing system exceptions, and preparing test executions, which include dealing with setup and teardown. This is related to the underlying problem and is likely relevant to our investigation.

Given our analysis, the needed content is:

```
src/_pytest/runner.py:pytest_runtest_call
```

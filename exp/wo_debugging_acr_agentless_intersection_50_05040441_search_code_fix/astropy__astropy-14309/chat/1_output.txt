To address the issue, I need to understand the implementation of the `identify_format` method as well as the `is_fits` function, which is causing the `IndexError`. Additionally, I need to understand how the `_identifiers` dictionary is set up in the `identify_format` context.

I need to locate and review the source code for:

1. `identify_format` method in the `astropy/io/registry/base.py` file.
2. `is_fits` function in the `astropy/io/fits/connect.py` file.
3. Examine how `_identifiers` is being utilized in the `identify_format`.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/io/registry/base.py", "identify_format")
search_code_in_file("astropy/io/fits/connect.py", "is_fits")
search_code_in_file("astropy/io/registry/base.py", "_identifiers")
```

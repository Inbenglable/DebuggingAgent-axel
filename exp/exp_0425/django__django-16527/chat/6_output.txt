To determine if the issue is fixed, let's review the process step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Issue:**
   - The issue was that the "show_save_as_new" logic in `admin_modify.py` needs to restrict the button display to when the user has both change and add permissions, as well as when other conditions like `save_as` are met.

2. **Reproduce Test:**
   - A test was created to verify that when a user lacks "add permission," the "Save as new" button should not be displayed; and conversely, when the user has both "add and change permissions," the button should appear.

3. **Original Output:**
   - The output before the patch showed a fail in the first test case, indicating the button was displayed without "add permission."

4. **Patch Implementation:**
   - The patch added the necessary check for `has_add_permission` to the logic controlling the "show_save_as_new" display.

5. **Patched Output:**
   - After applying the patch, all tests passed, including the test ensuring the button does not show without "add permission."

Based on the review:

- The patch correctly introduced a check for `has_add_permission` which resolved the issue described.
- The updated logic met the requirements outlined in the issue.
- The test output confirmed that the behavior is now correct.

Issue resolved: `True`

The patch modifies the `URLValidator` in `django/core/validators.py` to strip line feed (`\n`), carriage return (`\r`), and tab characters, addressing the issue described in the context. However, from the test outputs provided:

### Original Output
- Tests for URLs with line feed characters failed because `ValidationError` was not raised.

### Patched Output
- After applying the patch, the tests show the same failures. The `ValidationError` was still not raised for both test values containing line feed characters.

### Analysis
The intention of the patch is to strip problematic characters before processing the URL, in line with the recommended behavior following the bpo-43882 resolution. However, given the test case failure (where stripping was expected to lead to a successful validation), the tests might have been designed to expect `ValidationError` for URLs with newline characters, suggesting the alternative approach of enforcing early rejection instead of silent stripping.

In conclusion, the patch does not change the behavior as observed by the application's tests regarding character handling within the URL as intended for the current test setup.

Issue resolved: `False`

Based on the analysis and the observed code, the root cause of the bug appears to involve how the empty `__all__` attribute is handled. Currently, the logic in the `ClassDocumenter.get_object_members` method does not appropriately handle the case when `__all__` is empty.

I suspect that the handling of the `__all__` attribute should be explicitly coded to ensure no members are included when it is empty.

Given the analysis so far, we should examine how `__all__` is evaluated during the member extraction process, and likely make a modification to the `get_object_members` method to include this special handling.

### Next Observation:
Let's observe the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:get_object_members` method, specifically focusing on the relevant code section starting at line 1645 where member processing occurs.

Observed method: `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:get_object_members`

Let's take a closer look.

I need to retrieve the full implementation of the `__init__` method of the `InheritDocstrings` class before generating the patch. This will help me understand how the metaclass currently checks for functions and what modifications are necessary to accommodate properties.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/utils/misc.py", "InheritDocstrings.__init__")
```

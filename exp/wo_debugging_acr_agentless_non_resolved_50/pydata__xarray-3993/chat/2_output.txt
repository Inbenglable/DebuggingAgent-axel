To resolve the issue, I need to change the parameter name in the `DataArray.integrate` method from `dim` to `coord` for consistency with `Dataset.integrate`. I've already retrieved the source code for both methods. Since the necessary code segments have been obtained, I can proceed to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

From the analysis of the `send` method in `requests/sessions.py`, the problem arises during the URL validation process carried out by the `adapter.send(request, **kwargs)` call, which eventually leads to `urllib3` raising a `LocationParseError`.

The `requests.get` method should raise an `InvalidURL` exception instead. To achieve this, the `send` method should ideally catch the `LocationParseError` thrown by `urllib3` and convert it to `InvalidURL`.

Based on the runtime information and error trace provided, the issue seems to manifest downstream in the `send` method:

```python
645: r = adapter.send(request, **kwargs)
```

This line delegates the request to an `adapter` which eventually triggers the `LocationParseError`. To confirm if this is the location to implement the fix, it's necessary to trace the `adapter.send()` method further to examine how exceptions are handled.

Therefore, I want to observe the `send` method of the adapter being used to understand exception handling there.

Observed scope: `requests/adapters.py:400-460`

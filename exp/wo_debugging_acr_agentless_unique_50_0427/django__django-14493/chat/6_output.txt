To resolve the `UnboundLocalError` issue stemming from the `substitutions` variable being used before it is initialized in the `post_process` method, we need to ensure that the variable is defined before it can possibly be referenced. This involves initializing it at the correct point in the code, likely right before the loop where it might be used or checked.

Since we have not retrieved the complete code for the `StaticFilesStorage.post_process`, but we know it is within this file, the fix should take into account the logical location likely causing the uninitialized error:

```pythony
### django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if substitutions:
=======
        substitutions = None
        if substitutions:
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change initializes `substitutions` to `None` before it is checked. Hence, even if the preceding loop does not execute, `substitutions` is safely initialized, preventing the `UnboundLocalError`.

Now, let's format this into JSON for submission:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if substitutions:\n=======\n        substitutions = None\n        if substitutions:\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

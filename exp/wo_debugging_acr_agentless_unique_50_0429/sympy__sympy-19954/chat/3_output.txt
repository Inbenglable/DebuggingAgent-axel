To resolve the `IndexError` encountered in the `sylow_subgroup` and `minimal_blocks` methods, we will ensure that list deletion operations correctly handle list indices. We will introduce checks to prevent out-of-range index usage when deleting elements from lists. Here's the patch:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/combinatorics/perm_groups.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                        del num_blocks[i], blocks[i]\n=======\n                        if i < len(num_blocks) and i < len(blocks):\n                            del num_blocks[i], blocks[i]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation

- **Sympy/combinatorics/perm_groups.py**:
  - In the method `minimal_blocks`, before performing the deletion operation on `num_blocks` and `blocks`, we now check if the index `i` is valid. This verification prevents `IndexError` by ensuring that the index is within the bounds of both lists.
  
With this patch, the `minimal_blocks` method should no longer throw an `IndexError` when invoked in contexts similar to the ones presented in the issue.

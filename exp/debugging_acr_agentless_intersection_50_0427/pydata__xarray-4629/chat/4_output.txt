To resolve the issue, I need to modify the `merge_attrs` function to ensure that attributes are copied rather than referenced when `combine_attrs='override'` is specified. I need to retrieve the source code for the `merge_attrs` function located in `xarray/core/merge.py` to generate the patch.

```python
search_method_in_file("xarray/core/merge.py", "merge_attrs")
```

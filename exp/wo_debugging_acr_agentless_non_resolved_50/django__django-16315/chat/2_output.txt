To resolve the issue with `bulk_create`, I need to further examine how the `on_conflict` clauses are constructed and executed, particularly how it pulls column names. The `_batched_insert` method seems to be responsible for generating and executing the insert query with `ON CONFLICT` handling.

Therefore, I need to retrieve the `_batched_insert` method implementation from the file to understand how `db_column` names are handled in it. This method is likely crucial in manipulating column names within the SQL statements for bulk operations.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/query.py", "_batched_insert")
```

To review the patch and analyze the test output:

1. **Patch Review:**
   - The patch modifies the `runshell_db` method by:
     - Eliminating the creation of a temporary `.pgpass` file.
     - Setting the `PGPASSWORD` environment variable directly if a password is provided.
     - Switching from `subprocess.check_call` to `subprocess.run`, which allows passing a custom environment and is more modern.
     - Maintaining signal handling for SIGINT as before.

2. **Original Test Output:**
   - The test fails with a `FileNotFoundError`, indicating that the `psql` executable is not found. This suggests that the error may not be directly related to the password handling issue noted in the patch description.

3. **Patched Test Output:**
   - The test continues to fail with the same `FileNotFoundError` as before the patch. This suggests the issue is not in how the password is handled within the script but rather a missing `psql` command.

**Conclusion:**
- The original issue described concerns simplifying and making more reliable the password handling method using `PGPASSWORD`.
- The patch effectively changes the password handling mechanism as intended.
- However, based on the test results, the underlying problem was a missing `psql` command, which is not addressed by the patch.

Thus, from the perspective of fixing the specific issue related to subprocess and password handling as described, the patch is correct. But it does not resolve the test failure, which is due to a missing executable rather than incorrect password handling.

Issue resolved: `False`

To determine whether the issue has been fixed, let's review the provided patch and analyze the test output both before and after applying the patch.

### Patch Review

The patch modifies the `_print_Add` method to specifically handle terms involving matrix multiplications where the first argument of a term is `-1`. This is intended to correctly represent subtractions in the string representation by printing these terms with a `-` sign. The aim is to ensure subtractions are visually represented as `A - B` instead of `A + (-1)B`.

### Test Output Analysis

#### Original Test Output
Before applying the patch, the test failed with the following error during the `str` representation check:
```
AssertionError: Expected 'A - A*B - B' but got '(-1)*B + (-1)*A*B + A'
```
This confirms that the output did not correctly display the expected subtraction format.

#### Patched Test Output
After the patch was applied, the output of the test remained the same:
```
AssertionError: Expected 'A - A*B - B' but got '(-1)*B + (-1)*A*B + A'
```
The test still fails at the same point with the same output, indicating the patch did not alter the behavior and the problem persists.

### Conclusion
Since the patched output remains the same as the original output, the issue has not been resolved by the applied patch. The test still fails to produce the expected result in terms of string representation of a matrix subtraction.

Issue resolved: `False`

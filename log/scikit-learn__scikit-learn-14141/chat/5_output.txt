To add `joblib` to the dependencies listed in the `show_versions` function within the `_get_deps_info` method, we need to modify the list of dependencies that are being pulled into this function. Specifically, we just need to add `"joblib"` to the list of dependencies. Here is the necessary edit:

```python
### sklearn/utils/_show_versions.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        "matplotlib",
=======
        "matplotlib",
        "joblib",
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This patch will ensure that `joblib` is included in the dependencies checked by the `_get_deps_info` method.

Now, here is the edit result in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sklearn/utils/_show_versions.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        \"matplotlib\",\n=======\n        \"matplotlib\",\n        \"joblib\",\n>>>>>>> REPLACE"
  ]
}
```

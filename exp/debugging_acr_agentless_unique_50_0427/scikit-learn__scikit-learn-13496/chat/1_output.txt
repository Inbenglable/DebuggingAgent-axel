The error traceback indicates that the `IsolationForest` class does not recognize the parameter `warm_start`, which implies that `warm_start` is not defined as a valid parameter for this estimator. Specifically, the error occurs when the `set_params` method is called on an `IsolationForest` instance with `warm_start=True`.

Given that the `warm_start` parameter is part of the `BaseBagging` class but not explicitly handled in `IsolationForest`, it seems likely that the `warm_start` needs to be explicitly declared and documented in `IsolationForest`.

Let's trace the methods involved in parameter initialization and validation to understand where the `warm_start` parameter should be added.

### Analysis:
1. **The test script** initializes an `IsolationForest` and attempts to use `warm_start` which fails.
2. **Error Location**: The error occurs when calling `set_params`, specifically indicating that `warm_start` is not recognized, as seen in `sklearn/base.py` at line 223.
3. Since `BaseBagging` has `warm_start`, it should be ensured that `IsolationForest` accepts and processes it correctly.

### Next Step:
To trace the initialization and parameter handling within `IsolationForest`, I will observe the `__init__` method of the `IsolationForest` class.

### Conclusion:
Let's observe the constructor and check where parameters are being set up so that we can identify where the `warm_start` parameter should be declared.

**Observed method:** `sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py:IsolationForest.__init__`

Based on the analysis of the `_safe_first_finite` function, we need to ensure that when it doesn't find any finite numbers, it handles the `StopIteration` exception gracefully instead of raising it. Modifying the function to return `None` or `np.nan` in such a case will be a suitable fix. Now, let's update the code to address this issue:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        return next(val for val in obj if safe_isfinite(val))\n=======\n        try:\n            return next(val for val in obj if safe_isfinite(val))\n        except StopIteration:\n            return None\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This edit will ensure that when there are no finite values present, the function will gracefully return `None`, avoiding an unhandled `StopIteration` exception. Adjusting this part of the code should resolve the reported issue without affecting the original functionality of the method.

Certainly! Here's the correction with a valid search pattern capturing the requested change:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/simplify/fu.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if (rv.exp < 0) == True:\n            return rv\n        if (rv.exp > max) == True:\n            return rv\n=======\n        if rv.exp.is_number and (rv.exp < 0) == True:\n            return rv\n        if rv.exp.is_number and (rv.exp > max) == True:\n            return rv\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This edit ensures that the check for `rv.exp` being `is_number` is added to prevent the invalid comparison with complex numbers, as described in the plan. The replacement correctly ensures that only numeric exponents are compared, addressing the issue of complex exponent comparisons.

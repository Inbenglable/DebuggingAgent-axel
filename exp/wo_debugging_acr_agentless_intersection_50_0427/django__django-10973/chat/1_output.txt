To address the issue, I need to modify the implementation of the client in the `django.db.backends.postgres` backend to utilize `subprocess.run` and set `PGPASSWORD`. To do that, I first need to identify the method within the Django PostgreSQL backend that executes the client command. Since the specific method isn't mentioned, I need to search for it in the codebase.

I'll start by searching for the relevant method in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("client")
```

To resolve the issue of dropping support for SQLite versions older than 3.9.0 in a Django project, I need to determine where the support checks or version constraints for SQLite are currently implemented within the Django codebase. This involves identifying any checks, logic, or documentation related to SQLite version support.

I will need to search for code or settings where SQLite version checks are handled, typically in database backends or settings modules. Additionally, any related documentation or comments about SQLite version support should also be identified to update them accordingly.

I will start by searching for mentions of SQLite in the codebase to locate these areas.

```python
search_code_in_codebase("SQLite")
```

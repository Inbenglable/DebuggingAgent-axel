The errors indicate that there is some inconsistency with the method naming or structure in the `sympy/printing/repr.py` file. Since direct attempts to identify specific methods have not been successful, let's approach this from another angle by inspecting the broader context in which these methods work.

Instead of focusing on specific method names which might not exist or might be different, let's explore the initial setup and operation of the `ReprPrinter` class. This class is supposed to handle different types for representation, so inspecting constructors or related setup methods might provide insight into how it manages printing for sets and dictionaries.

Observed method: `sympy/printing/repr.py:ReprPrinter.__init__`

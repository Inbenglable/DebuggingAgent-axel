To resolve the issue, I need to examine the implementation of the `FileInput` and `ClearableFileInput` classes, particularly focusing on their `use_required_attribute` methods. This involves retrieving the relevant source code to understand how these methods currently handle the `required` attribute. I'll first locate the `ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute()` method in the specified file. Additionally, I need to check the `FileInput.use_required_attribute()` method, as these are crucial to addressing the issue raised. Furthermore, confirming the class definitions of `FileInput` and `ClearableFileInput` within the file will offer context on the necessary modifications.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "ClearableFileInput")
search_method_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute")
search_class_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "FileInput")
search_method_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "FileInput.use_required_attribute")
```

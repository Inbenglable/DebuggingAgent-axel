The issue lies within the `symbols` method in the `sympy` library. Based on the problem description and the `symbols` function implementation, there's an issue when unpacking symbol names from nested tuple forms (like `(('q:2', 'u:2'),)`) and the expectation that they produce objects of `Function` (e.g., `UndefinedFunction`) rather than `Symbol`.

The function currently seems to handle single level tuples correctly but not nested ones, leading to incorrect instantiation with `cls` as `Function`.

To fix this, we will need to investigate the logic that handles the nested tuple unpacking and ensure it respects the `cls` parameter when creating instances.

The only issue to resolve this is ensuring if the `cls` type is correctly instantiated even for lists inside tuples. We need to ensure that whenever `symbols` recursively calls itself, the `cls` and `seq` parameters are propagated correctly.

Since we already have the source code of the `symbols` method, we are ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

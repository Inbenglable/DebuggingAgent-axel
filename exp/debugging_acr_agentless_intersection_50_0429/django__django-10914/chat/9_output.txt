To resolve the identified issue, we need to modify the `FileSystemStorage._save` method to ensure the file permissions are explicitly set to `0o644` after moving files using `file_move_safe()`, especially for `TemporaryUploadedFile`. Since we haven't retrieved the code for `FileSystemStorage._save`, I need to obtain the source code for this method to create the patch.

I'll proceed to search for the `_save` method within `FileSystemStorage` in the `django/core/files/storage.py` file to make the necessary modifications.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/files/storage.py", "FileSystemStorage._save")
```

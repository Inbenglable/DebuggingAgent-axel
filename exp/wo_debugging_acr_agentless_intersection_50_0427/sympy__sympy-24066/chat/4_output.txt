To address the issue, I need to examine the source code of the `DimensionSystem.is_dimensionless` method. This will help to determine if any changes are needed to properly handle dimensionless exponents within `_collect_factor_and_dimension`.

Let's search for this method in the codebase:

```python
search_method_in_codebase("DimensionSystem.is_dimensionless")
```

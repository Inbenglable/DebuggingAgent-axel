To resolve the issue, I need to identify the location of the classes `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` in the Django codebase. This will allow me to modify the regular expressions as described in the issue. Since the file path is not provided, I should search for these classes in the entire codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ASCIIUsernameValidator")
search_class_in_codebase("UnicodeUsernameValidator")
```

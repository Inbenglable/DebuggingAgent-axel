The issue occurs due to the attempt to use aggregate functions on the result of window functions in Django 4.2, which is not supported by PostgreSQL. The error message suggests that PostgreSQL does not allow an aggregate function to encapsulate a window function directly.

To resolve this issue, we must modify the code to handle the aggregation in a way that PostgreSQL supports. This might involve restructuring the query or using subqueries to handle these operations separately.

Before generating the patch, we should gain insights into the usage patterns and behavior of Django's ORM when dealing with Window expressions and aggregation. This will involve checking for related source code in Django's ORM or Query library. Let's search for the presence of relevant classes and methods used in these operations in the Django codebase. This will help in understanding how Window functions and aggregates are managed.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Window")
search_class_in_codebase("Sum")
```

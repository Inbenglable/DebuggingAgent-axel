In order to resolve the inconsistency between the `fit_predict` and `predict` methods when `n_init > 1`, we need to ensure that the parameters used in the prediction are consistent in both methods, specifically around handling the `log_resp` computed after fitting. 

Let's proceed with generating the patch:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sklearn/mixture/base.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        return log_resp.argmax(axis=1)\n=======\n        labels = log_resp.argmax(axis=1)\n        # Ensure consistency with predict method\n        self._set_parameters(best_params)\n        return labels\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This edit ensures that the parameters selected as `best_params` are actually set before the labels are returned in `fit_predict`. This should maintain consistency with the `predict` method when `n_init > 1`.

To resolve the issue regarding the import order in Django migration files, I will modify the `MigrationWriter.as_string` method to ensure that it adheres to the Django coding style and aligns with isort defaults. Specifically, the sort order needs to place `import` statements before `from ... import` statements.

Here are the editable sections that need changes:

```pythony
### django/db/migrations/writer.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        sorted_imports = sorted(imports, key=lambda i: i.split()[1])
=======
        sorted_imports = sorted(imports, key=lambda i: (i.startswith('import '), i.split()[1]))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This modification will ensure that `import` statements are placed before `from ... import` statements during sorting. Now, I will provide the JSON format for the changes:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/migrations/writer.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        sorted_imports = sorted(imports, key=lambda i: i.split()[1])\n=======\n        sorted_imports = sorted(imports, key=lambda i: (i.startswith('import '), i.split()[1]))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

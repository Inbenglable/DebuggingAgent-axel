To resolve the issue, I need to examine the `PyMethod` class from the file `sphinx/domains/python.py`. The `get_index_text` method seems to be relevant because it likely handles the generation of index entries and could be responsible for adding parentheses when the `:property:` option is present. To proceed, I need to retrieve the source code of this specific method within the class.

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/domains/python.py", "PyMethod.get_index_text")
```

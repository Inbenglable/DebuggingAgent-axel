Upon reviewing the provided patch and analyzing the outputs before and after applying the patch, here are the observations:

1. **Original Problem**: The issue arises because version comparisons are being done using strings, which leads to incorrect comparisons such as `'0.10.0'` being considered less than `'0.6.0'`. This is due to lexicographical string comparison.

2. **Patch Description**: The patch suggests replacing string comparison with semantic version comparison using `packaging.version.Version`. This approach should correctly compare version numbers based on their actual semantic meaning.

3. **Patch Content**: 
   - The original condition `if required_version > actual_version:` is replaced with `if Version(actual_version) < Version(required_version):` using `packaging.version.Version`.

4. **Patched Test Output**: 
   - The test output after applying the patch indicates a syntax error: `IndentationError: unexpected indent`. This implies that there is an indentation issue in the patched code, preventing the test from running correctly.

Given the `IndentationError`, the patched script cannot execute successfully, which means that while the logic for solving the version comparison issue is correct, the code itself is not executable due to a formatting issue.

Therefore, the issue is not resolved because the patch contains a syntax error, preventing the test from properly verifying whether the logic fix is correct.

Issue resolved: `False`

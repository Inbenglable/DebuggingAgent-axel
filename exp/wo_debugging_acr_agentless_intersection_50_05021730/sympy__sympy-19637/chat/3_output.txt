To fix the `UnboundLocalError` issue, we need to ensure that the `kern` variable is initialized before usage. We can initialize `kern` with a default value or handle the condition where `' ' in s` is false more gracefully. This way, we avoid using `kern` before it's assigned. Let's make the necessary changes in the `kernS` function.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/core/sympify.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    if '(' in s and not quoted:\n=======\n    kern = ''\n    if '(' in s and not quoted:\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This change initializes `kern` as an empty string before the `if` block. It ensures that `kern` is defined regardless of the conditions met later in the code.

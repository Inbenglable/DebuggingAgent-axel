To resolve the issue, I need one more piece of information regarding the definition and behavior of `false` within SymPy, which might provide the context necessary to generate a patch. Specifically, investigating `BooleanAtom` could be beneficial, as it is typically associated with Boolean representations within SymPy.

Let's proceed by retrieving the definition of `false` or relevant logic from `sympy/core/logic.py` to ensure a correct adjustment for the equality comparisons.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("false")
search_class_in_file("sympy/core/logic.py", "BooleanAtom")
```

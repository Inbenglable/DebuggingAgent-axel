The source code for the `UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension` method has been retrieved, which is essential for resolving the issue. This method currently raises a `ValueError` when the dimensions of all addends in an expression are not the same. However, it should be able to interpret dimensionless exponents correctly, specifically for expressions involving exponential functions (`exp`) where the exponent should be dimensionless (i.e., `Dimension(1)`).

Upon reviewing the code, it appears that the handling of dimensionless exponents in the `Pow` operation is already partially accounted for by checking if the exponent's dimension is dimensionless. We still need to ensure similar treatment for scenarios like the `Add` operation involving functions such as `exp`.

Ready generation: `True`

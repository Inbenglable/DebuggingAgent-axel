To address the issue described, I need to patch the `ModelBackend.authenticate` method to avoid unnecessary database queries when both `username` and `password` are `None`. 

I will now proceed to retrieve the source code of the `ModelBackend.authenticate` method to be able to generate the patch.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("ModelBackend.authenticate")
```

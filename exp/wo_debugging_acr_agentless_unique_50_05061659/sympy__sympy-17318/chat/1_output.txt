To resolve the issue where `sqrtdenest` raises an `IndexError`, it is essential to address the identified problem within the code files: `sympy/simplify/sqrtdenest.py` and `sympy/simplify/radsimp.py`. To create a patch, I'll need to gather the source code related to the methods involved in the traceback: `_sqrtdenest0`, `_sqrtdenest1`, `_sqrt_match`, and `split_surds`. These methods appear to be closely connected to the issue described.

First, I will search for the methods within the files mentioned:

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/simplify/sqrtdenest.py", "_sqrtdenest0")
search_method_in_file("sympy/simplify/sqrtdenest.py", "_sqrtdenest1")
search_method_in_file("sympy/simplify/sqrtdenest.py", "_sqrt_match")
search_method_in_file("sympy/simplify/radsimp.py", "split_surds")
```

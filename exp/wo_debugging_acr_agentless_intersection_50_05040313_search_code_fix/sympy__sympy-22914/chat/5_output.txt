The patch applied indicates an attempt to add the `_print_Min` and `_print_Max` methods to the `PythonCodePrinter` class to support the `Min` and `Max` functions. However, the patched test output shows an `IndentationError`, which means the code formatting is incorrect. Specifically, there is an error regarding the indentation level for the newly added methods within the PythonCodePrinter class.

The `IndentationError` indicates that the added methods were not correctly integrated into the existing code structureâ€”they need to be indented to match the other method definitions within the class.

The test output before applying the patch expected the `pycode` function to generate a string that includes `min(a, b)`. Instead, it originally generated a conditional expression `((a) if (a <= b) else (b))`, which indicates that the existing implementation didn't directly map the `Min` function to Python's `min()`.

After the patch, due to the `IndentationError`, the test was not run successfully, and thus, the bug issue wasn't resolved.

To fix this, the patch needs to be correctly formatted with proper indentation, ensuring that the new methods are part of the class body.

Issue resolved: `False`

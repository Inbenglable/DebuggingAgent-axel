To address the issue, I need to investigate the `DatasetCoarsen` class and its `construct` method, as the `coarsen` method in `Dataset` returns an instance of this class. This will help identify how the coordinate properties are altered during the `construct` operation.

Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code for the `DatasetCoarsen` class and its `construct` method.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("DatasetCoarsen")
search_method_in_codebase("DatasetCoarsen.construct")
```

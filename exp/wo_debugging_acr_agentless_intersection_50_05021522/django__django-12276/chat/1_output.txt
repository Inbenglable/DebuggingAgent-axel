To address this issue, I need to review the source code for the `ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute()` method. Currently, it is specified that this method should be moved to `FileInput.use_required_attribute()`. I want to analyze the existing implementation of `ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute()` to find a way to ensure that the required attribute isn't output when initial data exists. I'll also check the `FileInput` class since the method will be relocated there. 

Thus, I will search for both the `ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute()` method and the `FileInput` class implementation in the `django/forms/widgets.py` file.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "ClearableFileInput")
search_class_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "FileInput")
```

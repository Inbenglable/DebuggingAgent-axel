To fix the reported issue, I need to review the implementation details of the `ManagementUtility` class, specifically the method where `CommandParser` is instantiated with program name-related parameters. As the file path of the class is `django/core/management/__init__.py`, I will search for the method implementation in this file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/management/__init__.py", "execute")
search_method_in_file("django/core/management/__init__.py", "__init__")
```

To resolve the issue, I need to examine the current implementation of the `partitions` method to understand how it manages the output dictionaries. This will guide me to implement a solution where the output dictionaries are copied before being yielded. 

Let's start by retrieving the source code of the `partitions` method, which is located in the `sympy.utilities.iterables` module.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("partitions")
```

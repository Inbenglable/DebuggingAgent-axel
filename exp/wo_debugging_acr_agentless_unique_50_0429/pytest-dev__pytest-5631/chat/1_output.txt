To fix the issue described, the `num_mock_patch_args` method in `_pytest/compat.py` needs to be examined, as the error is occurring due to how it is handling certain types of objects when checking `p.new in sentinels`. This indicates the need to retrieve the source code for `num_mock_patch_args`.

I'll start by searching for the `num_mock_patch_args` method in the codebase to obtain its code for examination.

```python
search_method_in_file("_pytest/compat.py", "num_mock_patch_args")
```

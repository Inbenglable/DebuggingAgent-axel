I need to retrieve more code to understand the context where the transformation happens. Particularly, I want to make sure I have the context around the conditional that does the ndarray to NdarrayMixin transformation and where I would add the `FutureWarning`. I will search for the method in which this transformation occurs within the `astropy/table/table.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/table/table.py", "Column")
```

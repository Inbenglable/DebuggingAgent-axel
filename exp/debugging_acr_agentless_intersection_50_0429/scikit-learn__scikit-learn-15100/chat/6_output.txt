The issue described in the bug report pertains to the `strip_accents_unicode` function not stripping accents properly from strings that are already in NFKD form. The provided patch attempts to address this by modifying the logic inside the function to always remove combining characters from the normalized string, regardless of whether the string is already in NFKD form or not.

Analyzing the original output of the test, we can see an assertion error occurs because `strip_accents_unicode(s2)` does not return the expected result of `"n"`, instead returning `"nÌƒ"`.

The patch removes the condition that returns the original string if it is already normalized and ensures that combining characters are always stripped from the string. This should handle strings like `s2` that are in NFKD form.

Reviewing the patched output indicates that the function now returns `"n"` for both test cases `s1` and `s2`, and the assertion does not produce an error, suggesting that the patch resolves the issue.

Based on this analysis:

Issue resolved: `True`

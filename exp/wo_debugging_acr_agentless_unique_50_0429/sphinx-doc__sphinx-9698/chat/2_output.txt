To resolve the issue of an index entry with parentheses being registered for the `py:method` directive with the `:property:` option, I need to investigate how the indexing is currently implemented in the Sphinx project, specifically for `py:method` directives.

This typically involves looking at the Sphinx domain for Python (`sphinx.domains.python`) since it handles the `py:method` directive, and how it processes the `:property:` option.

Let's start by searching for the `py:method` directive implementation within the Sphinx codebase to examine how it registers these entries.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("py:method")
```

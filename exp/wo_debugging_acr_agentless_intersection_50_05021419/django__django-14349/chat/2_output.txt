To address the issue, we need to focus on the relevant tests that are failing in relation to the `URLValidator`.

Let's go through the API returned results:

1. **`reproduce.py:TestURLValidator.test_validators`**

   - **Content:**
     This snippet shows a `test_validators` method that creates a `URLValidator` instance and tests it with URL values containing an LF character. The test expects a `ValidationError` to be raised if the URL is invalid.

   - **Relevance:**
     This test is directly related to the issue since it tests URLs containing newline characters, which relates to the described failing test scenario. Hence, it is relevant.

2. **`tests/validators/tests.py:TestValidators.test_validators`**

   - **Content:**
     This is a different `test_validators` method that tests various validators using predefined test data. It expects a specified exception if an input value is invalid.

   - **Relevance:**
     This method's validation logic is generic and not specifically related to the `URLValidator`. There's no direct mention of handling new line characters in URLs, making it less specifically relevant to the issue at hand.

Based on this analysis, the needed content is from `reproduce.py`, which addresses the specific problem discussed in the issue description:

```
reproduce.py:TestURLValidator.test_validators
```

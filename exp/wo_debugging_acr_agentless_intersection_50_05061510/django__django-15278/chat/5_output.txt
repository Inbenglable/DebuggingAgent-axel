To address the issue, I need to have a complete understanding of the `add_field` method in the `SQLiteSchemaEditor` class and potentially any other relevant parts of this class that handle unique constraints. Since I have already retrieved the `add_field` method, I will now look for the complete class implementation to ensure I have enough context to implement a fix or workaround for this bug.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py", "SQLiteSchemaEditor")
```

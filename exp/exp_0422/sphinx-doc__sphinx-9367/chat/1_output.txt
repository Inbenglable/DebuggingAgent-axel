To start debugging this issue, we need a test that evaluates the parsing of a single-element tuple using Sphinx's AST parsing and unparsing functionality. We'll create a debugging test that checks if the single-element tuple `(1,)` is parsed and unparsed correctly. 

Here's the JSON object containing our minimal debugging test code:

```json
{
  "debugging_test" : "from sphinx.pycode import ast\n\n# Test single-element tuple parsing and unparsing\nsource = \"(1,)\"\nmodule = ast.parse(source)\nresult = ast.unparse(module.body[0].value, source)\n\n# Print results for debugging\nprint(f\"Input: {source}\")\nprint(f\"Output: {result}\")\nprint(f\"Expected: {source}\")\nprint(f\"Matches expected? {result == source}\")"
}
```

This code performs the following steps:
- Parses the single-element tuple using Sphinx's AST capabilities.
- Unparses the resulting AST to get the output string.
- Compares the unparsed output against the original input to verify correctness.
- Prints the input, output, and comparison result for easy debugging. 

Next, you can use this test case to investigate where the parsing or unparsing is incorrectly handling the single-element tuple.

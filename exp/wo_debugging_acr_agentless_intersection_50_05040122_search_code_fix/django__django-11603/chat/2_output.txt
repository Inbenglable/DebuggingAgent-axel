To generate the patch for adding DISTINCT support, I need to retrieve the full source code of the `Avg` and `Sum` classes found in the `django/db/models/aggregates.py` file. I need to ensure we can set these classes as allowing DISTINCT. 

Let's retrieve the class definitions for `Avg` and `Sum`.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Avg")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Sum")
```

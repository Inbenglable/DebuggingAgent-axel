To proceed with generating the patch, I need to better understand the context around where `opts = cur_model._meta` is being used in the code and assess if other related parts of the implementation could be affected by the proposed fix. Specifically, examining the method in which this line appears will provide insights into how modifying it to `opts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta` impacts other operations. 

Given that line 748-754 was retrieved, I need to check if this snippet belongs to a larger method that requires more understanding before altering the code.

Therefore, I will search for the method in the file `django/db/models/sql/query.py` that contains the line of code in question.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/sql/query.py", "cur_model")
```

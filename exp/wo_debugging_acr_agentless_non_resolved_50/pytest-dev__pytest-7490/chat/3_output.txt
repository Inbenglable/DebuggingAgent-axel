To create a patch that resolves the issue, we need to understand how the xfail marker, once added using `add_marker`, interacts with the pytest outcomes and exception handling mechanisms, particularly with the `XFailed` class and the `xfail` function in `src/_pytest/outcomes.py`. I already have the code for `Node.add_marker` and `xfail`, and now I need to inspect how exceptions are raised and handled related to xfail conditions.

Here's what I will do:
1. Investigate the handling of xfail outcomes and `XFailed` to gain insight into the behavior change between pytest 5.x and 6.x.

Since I need additional context on `XFailed`, I will retrieve the source code for it:

```python
search_class_in_codebase("XFailed")
```

## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
timesince() raises TypeError with USE_TZ=True and >1 month interval.
Description
	 
		(last modified by Sage Abdullah)
	 
As of 8d67e16493c903adc9d049141028bc0fff43f8c8, calling timesince() with a datetime object that's one month (or more) in the past and the USE_TZ setting is set to True results in the following crash:
TypeError: can't subtract offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes
Test:
...
class TimesinceTests(TestCase):
	...
	@requires_tz_support
	@override_settings(USE_TZ=True)
	def test_long_interval_with_tz(self):
		now = timezone.now()
		d = now - datetime.timedelta(days=31)
		self.assertEqual(timesince(d), "1\xa0month")
I believe this is because the pivot instantiated here: â€‹https://github.com/django/django/blob/d2310f6473593d28c14b63a72253408b568e100a/django/utils/timesince.py#L93-L100 does not take into account the datetime object's tzinfo. Adding 0, d.tzinfo arguments to the datetime.datetime call seems to fix this.
Happy to send a PR.

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue with the `timesince()` function in Django, I need to examine its source code to understand the existing implementation and identify where the fix needs to be applied. Hence, I will search for the `timesince` method in the Django codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("timesince")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("timesince")
RESULT:
#### django/utils/timesince.py:timesince
```python
def timesince(d, now=None, reversed=False, time_strings=None, depth=2):
    """
    Take two datetime objects and return the time between d and now as a nicely
    formatted string, e.g. "10 minutes". If d occurs after now, return
    "0 minutes".

    Units used are years, months, weeks, days, hours, and minutes.
    Seconds and microseconds are ignored.

    The algorithm takes into account the varying duration of years and months.
    There is exactly "1 year, 1 month" between 2013/02/10 and 2014/03/10,
    but also between 2007/08/10 and 2008/09/10 despite the delta being 393 days
    in the former case and 397 in the latter.

    Up to `depth` adjacent units will be displayed.  For example,
    "2 weeks, 3 days" and "1 year, 3 months" are possible outputs, but
    "2 weeks, 3 hours" and "1 year, 5 days" are not.

    `time_strings` is an optional dict of strings to replace the default
    TIME_STRINGS dict.

    `depth` is an optional integer to control the number of adjacent time
    units returned.

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

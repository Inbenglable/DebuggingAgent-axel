The `set_level` method has been retrieved, and now we have a clear understanding of the bug. The method uses `None` as the key when storing the initial log level if no specific logger is provided, which leads to the issue mentioned. To resolve this, we should ensure that a meaningful key is used to store log levels, such as the logger name or a specific identifier, even when the root logger is being used.

Given this understanding, I'm ready to generate a patch to resolve the issue. 

Ready generation: `True`

To resolve this issue, I need to review the implementation details of the function that interacts with proxy models and the `select_related` and `only` functionality that leads to the crash. Based on the traceback, relevant code would likely be in the same area where `opts = cur_model._meta` is mentioned.

To proceed, I'll retrieve the relevant source code where this bug occurs.

```python
search_code_in_file("django/db/models/sql/query.py", "opts = cur_model._meta")
```

To address the issue of `ModelChoiceField` not including the value of the invalid choice in the `ValidationError`, I need to modify the error message during the validation process. Specifically, the `validate` method of the `ModelChoiceField` class is likely where this error message is handled. Since I need to ensure the value of the invalid choice is incorporated into the error message, I should retrieve the source code for the `validate` method.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/forms/models.py", "ModelChoiceField.validate")
```

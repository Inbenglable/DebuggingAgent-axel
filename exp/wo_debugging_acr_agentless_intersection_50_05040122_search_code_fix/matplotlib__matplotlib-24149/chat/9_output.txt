To fix the issue in the `matplotlib` code where `ax.bar` raises an exception with all-nan data, we need to update the method `_safe_first_finite` inside `matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py`. This function currently does not handle cases where the input list is comprised entirely of non-finite values like NaN, leading to a `StopIteration` error. By modifying it to return `np.nan` instead of raising an exception, we can prevent the error and maintain the behavior compatible with NaN inputs.

Here are the edit patches to fix the issue:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    return next(val for val in obj if safe_isfinite(val))\n=======\n    try:\n        return next(val for val in obj if safe_isfinite(val))\n    except StopIteration:\n        return np.nan\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation:
- The `_safe_first_finite` function is modified to handle a `StopIteration` exception by returning `np.nan` when no finite values are found. This code uses a try-except block, ensuring the code remains robust when inputs are entirely NaN or non-finite, thus aligning with the expected behavior in the original issue summary. This change ensures that invoking `ax.bar` with all-NaN values works without raising an exception, preserving compatibility with previous versions.

The issue you're encountering is due to the Django settings not being properly configured before accessing the models. The trace clearly indicates that the error `django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured` is raised when attempting to access `settings.INSTALLED_APPS`. This occurs because the environment variable `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is not set or misconfigured.

To address the issue, it's crucial to ensure that the Django settings are properly set up before importing Django-specific parts like `models`. The observed traceback and analysis suggest that the setup environment line might be incorrectly placed or misconfigured.

### Current Observations:
1. The environment variable `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is not set, resulting in `settings_module` being `None`.
2. The error is triggered in `LazySettings.__getattr__` when it tries to access `INSTALLED_APPS` without proper settings.
3. The script attempts to import Django models before configuring the settings.

### Next Steps:
To properly diagnose and resolve the issue, we need to ascertain how and where the settings are being assessed and ensure configurations occur prior to any Django imports.

Observed method: `django/conf/__init__.py:Settings._setup`

This method is responsible for setting up the settings environment, making it crucial in diagnosing why and where the settings configuration is failing. Observing this should illuminate the correct setup process or point out any implicit missteps in the current configuration.

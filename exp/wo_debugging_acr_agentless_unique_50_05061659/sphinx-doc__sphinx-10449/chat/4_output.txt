To resolve the issue where `autodoc_typehints = "description"` causes autoclass to include an incorrect return type for class constructors, I need to inspect the `ClassDocumenter` class further, specifically the `format_signature` method, as it's potentially involved in handling type hints in signatures. Additionally, we need to verify if there's any interaction with the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` related type hint handling, possibly in a method related to processing function or class constructor signatures. I'll retrieve the source code for the `format_signature` method.

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py", "ClassDocumenter.format_signature")
```

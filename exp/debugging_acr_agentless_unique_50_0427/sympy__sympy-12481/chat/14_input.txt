You are a PR reviewer that needs to review the patch generated by a bug repair agent and determine whether the issue is fixed or not.
This is the bug issue, which is in the **sympy** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
`Permutation` constructor fails with non-disjoint cycles
Calling `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` raises a `ValueError` instead of constructing the identity permutation.  If the cycles passed in are non-disjoint, they should be applied in left-to-right order and the resulting permutation should be returned.

This should be easy to compute.  I don't see a reason why non-disjoint cycles should be forbidden.

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
## REPRODUCE TEST
```
import sys
from sympy.combinatorics.permutations import Permutation

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        # Attempt to create a Permutation with non-disjoint cycles
        p = Permutation([[0, 1], [0, 1]])
        # If no exception is raised, check if the permutation is the identity
        assert p == Permutation([0, 1]), "The permutation should be the identity permutation."
    except ValueError as e:
        # Print the stack trace and raise an AssertionError
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Permutation constructor raised ValueError for non-disjoint cycles instead of constructing the identity permutation.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

And this is the original output when running the test (before applying the patch):

The repair agent has tried to generate a patch to fix the issue:
## PATCH CONTEXT
<PATCH_CONTEXT>
To resolve the issue with non-disjoint cycles in the `Permutation` constructor in SymPy, I will adjust the logic within `__new__` method to handle non-disjoint cycles correctly by applying them in sequence rather than rejecting them due to duplication. This will include modifying the check for duplicate elements to only raise an error for array-style (not cycle-style) inputs. Here's the patch to apply these changes:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if has_dups(temp):\n            if is_cycle:\n                raise ValueError('there were repeated elements; to resolve '\n                'cycles use Cycle%s.' % ''.join([str(tuple(c)) for c in args]))\n            else:\n                raise ValueError('there were repeated elements.')\n=======\n        if not is_cycle and has_dups(temp):\n            raise ValueError('there were repeated elements.')\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",

    "### sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            c = Cycle()\n            for ci in args:\n                c = c(*ci)\n            aform = c.list()\n=======\n            aform = list(range(max(temp) + 1))\n            for cycle in args:\n                if cycle:\n                    first = cycle[0]\n                    for next in cycle[1:]:\n                        aform[first], first = aform[next], aform[first]\n                    aform[first] = first\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation:
- **First Edit**: This change ensures that the duplication check is only applied to array-style inputs, thereby allowing non-disjoint cycles to be passed without error.
- **Second Edit**: Update the logic for handling cycle inputs to actually apply the cycles in sequence, thus constructing the correct permutation when non-disjoint cycles are present.

By applying these changes, the `Permutation` constructor should now handle non-disjoint cycles correctly, adhering to the left-to-right application as required.

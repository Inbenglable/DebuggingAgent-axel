<ISSUE>
srepr not printing dict and set properly
`srepr` prints the element in `list` and `tuple` correctly.
```python
>>> from sympy import srepr
>>> from sympy.abc import x,y
>>> srepr([x,y])
[Symbol('x'), Symbol('y')]
>>> srepr((x,y))
(Symbol('x'), Symbol('y'))
```

However, `srepr` prints the elements in `dict` and `set` wrong.
```python
>>> srepr({x, y})
{x, y}
>>> srepr({x: y})
{x: y}
```

Is this behavior intended? If it isn't, fixing it will be an easy job.

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
Based on the issue description and the test failure output, the problem lies in the `srepr` method not correctly handling `set` and `dict` types in the `sympy` library. The test clearly indicates that the expected output for a set should be represented as `FiniteSet(Symbol('x'), Symbol('y'))`, and for a dict as `Dict(Symbol('x'), Symbol('y'))`, but instead, it simply outputs `{y, x}` and `{x: y}` respectively. The printing of the set and dict directly using their Python representations instead of SymPy's internal representations is incorrect according to the test expectations.

In the provided output, we see that `srepr` is a function within the file `sympy/printing/repr.py`. This function calls `ReprPrinter(settings).doprint(expr)`, which indicates that the printing is being done by the `doprint` method of the `ReprPrinter` class. Hence, the abnormal behavior is likely due to this method failing to detect sets and dicts and pass them to appropriate handler methods, which should convert them into `FiniteSet` and `Dict`.

We should start by inspecting the `doprint` method in the `ReprPrinter` class to trace how it processes different types of input. This will help us determine why it is handling sets and dicts improperly.

Observed method: `sympy/printing/printer.py:ReprPrinter.doprint`
==================================================
Based on the current analysis, the issue seems to stem from the `doprint` method inside the `ReprPrinter` class, which calls `self._print(expr)`. The default behavior of `_print` does not handle `dict` and `set` objects following SymPy's internal representation for `srepr`. Consequently, these types are rendered using their standard Python representations. 

To resolve this, I need to observe the `_print` method implementation in `ReprPrinter` to ensure it appropriately handles `set` and `dict` objects by forwarding them to a suitable handler that returns a `FiniteSet` or `Dict` representation.

Observed scope: `sympy/printing/printer.py:251-251`
==================================================
Based on the analysis of the current observation, the issue arises from improper handling of `set` and `dict` types when using the `srepr` function. The `doprint` method in `ReprPrinter` calls the `_print` method, which traverses the Python class hierarchy (`classes`) of `expr` looking for a suitable print method specifically for the `set` type (i.e., `_print_set`). However, it seems that no such method is implemented for handling a `set` type using SymPy's internal representation. Consequently, the `_print` method defaults to using `self.emptyPrinter(expr)`, which results in the standard Python representation `{y, x}`.

To resolve the issue, a specialized print method for the `set` type, likely named `_print_set`, should be implemented to transform it appropriately into SymPy's `FiniteSet` representation.

Now, based on this analysis, I will locate and analyze the `_print` method, specifically observing if a print method for sets might exist, and inspect the logic where it defaults to using `emptyPrinter`.

Buggy method: `sympy/printing/printer.py:ReprPrinter._print`

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue, I need to obtain the source code for the `ReprPrinter._print` method, as this is where the improper handling of sets and dicts occurs. Additionally, I should ensure that this class or method can properly adapt to these types.

Let's start by retrieving the source code for the relevant method and potentially the class if additional context is needed.

==================================================

Your Output:
To properly handle the `set` and `dict` types, we need to implement specific methods such as `_print_set` and `_print_dict` in the `ReprPrinter` class. We need to ensure that these types are printed using SymPy's `FiniteSet` and `Dict` representations, respectively.

First, I need to check if there are similar print methods already implemented in the `ReprPrinter` class or associated files that deal with `FiniteSet` and `Dict` explicitly.

I'll retrieve the source code for the `ReprPrinter` class to identify any helper methods and see the current handling for such types. Once the code for the class is obtained, I'll have sufficient context to build and implement the new methods.

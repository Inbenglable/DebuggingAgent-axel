## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Removing a default header of a session
[The docs](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#session-objects) say that you can prevent sending a session header by setting the headers value to None in the method's arguments. You would expect (as [discussed on IRC](https://botbot.me/freenode/python-requests/msg/10788170/)) that this would work for session's default headers, too:

``` python
session = requests.Session()
# Do not send Accept-Encoding
session.headers['Accept-Encoding'] = None
```

What happens is that "None"  gets sent as the value of header.

```
Accept-Encoding: None
```

For the reference, here is a way that works:

``` python
del session.headers['Accept-Encoding']
```

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
To analyze the abnormal behavior and identify why the `TypeError: expected string or bytes-like object` is occurring, let's trace through the process of setting the headers and making the request.

The problematic behavior arises from setting a header value to `None`. When this value is used during a request, it is not compatible with expectations of the underlying HTTP client, which expects a string or bytes-like object.

The execution trace shows the stack leading up to the error:
1. `session.get('http://httpbin.org/headers')` ends up calling `self.request('GET', url, **kwargs)`.
2. This leads to the `send` method in `requests.sessions.py`.
3. Following that, it delves into `requests.adapters.py` to `adapter.send(request, **kwargs)`.
4. Eventually, it reaches `urllib3.connectionpool.py`, and finally, the execution ends up in `http.client.py`, where the error arises due to the attempt to use a `None` value for a header.

The key observation is the handling of headers within the `session` and how it propagates to a point where a header value ends up being processed by the HTTP client.

Since setting a header value to `None` does not inherently remove it but instead leads to an invalid value passed downstream, the source resolution will need to be where headers are modified or read within the request process.

For this, locating where headers are handled during requests in the `requests.sessions` module is pivotal. Based on the anomaly, we need to inspect how headers are stored and manipulated through the process of building an HTTP request.

Further observation is necessary in:

Observed method: `requests/sessions.py:Session.request`
==================================================
To address the issue of the default header setting to `None` resulting in an incorrect header being sent, we must analyze the `Session.request` method further. The main problem is that setting the header to `None` does not remove it but leads to `'Accept-Encoding: None'` being sent.

In the `Session.request` method, headers are passed as part of the `Request` object creation at line 349. The `Request` object is then prepared using the `self.prepare_request(req)` method, creating the `prep` object at line 357. This prepared request is eventually sent using `self.send(prep, **send_kwargs)` at line 391.

The preparation of the request, particularly the headers handling, should be scrutinized as it's where the `None` value might be improperly retained rather than removed. This likely occurs during the preparation phase, where headers from the session and any additional headers are merged and normalized.

Given the current trace and the abnormal behavior, the next logical step is to observe how headers are managed during request preparation, particularly any operations that normalize or filter the headers.

Therefore, let's delve deeper into the `prepare_request` function to inspect how headers are handled:

```plaintext
Observed scope: requests/sessions.py:357  # Observe how the headers are prepared and passed.
```

Please provide further execution details regarding the `prepare_request` method and how headers are processed and normalized.
==================================================
### Analysis of Current Observations

From our current understanding:

1. We have identified that the issue is caused by setting a header value to `None`, which propagates down and results in an invalid header being used.
2. We are focusing on the `Session.request` method in `requests/sessions.py`, particularly how headers are prepared and normalized.
3. The specific line we are observing is line 357, where the `self.prepare_request(req)` method is called on the request object (`req`).

In the last observation attempt, the execution failed due to an assertion error in the test execution framework (`AssertionError`), which is unrelated to the functionality of the `requests` library. So, we need to proceed by analyzing how headers are prepared and normalized in the `prepare_request` method.

### Further Observation

Given the focus on how headers are processed, the next logical step is to trace through the `prepare_request` method in the `requests/sessions.py` file to understand how `None` values are being handled.

### Next Step

Let's observe the `prepare_request` method to further trace how headers are processed and how `None` values are being handled:

```plaintext
Observed method: requests/sessions.py:Session.prepare_request
```
==================================================
### Analysis of Current Observations

From the current code in the `Session.prepare_request` method, we observe the following:

1. **Header Processing**: The headers are being merged from the request's headers and the session's headers using `merge_setting` at line 291, and stored within the `PreparedRequest` object (`p`).

2. **Merging Headers**: The function `merge_setting` is used to combine headers from the session and the request. This is the point where the header value of `'Accept-Encoding': None` could potentially lead to an incorrect header being retained because it is merged without specific handling for `None` values.

3. **PreparedRequest Preparation**: The `PreparedRequest` object actually prepares the headers for transmission. Thus, we should be cautious about how headers are set and eventually used.

### Abnormal Behavior

The abnormal behavior arises when a header value is explicitly set to `None`, and rather than removing that header or handling the `None` value gracefully, it is sent downstream causing invalid HTTP headers.

### Next Steps

To trace the handling of headers further:

- **Continue Tracking the `PreparedRequest.prepare`**: Although the setup of headers seems to take place at line 291, we need to verify how headers are finally prepared for the HTTP request in the `PreparedRequest.prepare` method.

Therefore, the next logical step in the tracing process is to inspect how headers are further managed in the `PreparedRequest.prepare` method. 

Let's observe `PreparedRequest.prepare` to ensure how headers are finalized for transmission:

```plaintext
Observed scope: requests/models.py:400-450
```

This scope can provide insights into the final preparation phase for headers and identify where the handling of `None` values should be adjusted.
==================================================
### Analysis of Current Observations

From the code snippet provided for `Session.prepare_request`, we make the following observations:

1. **Headers Handling**: The code navigates through the process of preparing the HTTP request body and headers. Although this snippet focuses primarily on the body and content types, there is handling of headers such as `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding`, but there is no direct manipulation or normalization of headers like `Accept-Encoding`.

2. **Appending Headers**: Headers like `Content-Type` are appended conditionally, which suggests that this method prepares headers but does not necessarily modify existing headers unless specific conditions are met (e.g., file uploads, content encoding).

3. **Potential Disconnect**: The abnormal behavior related to setting a header value to `None` seems disconnected from the operations in this specific code snippet. It appears that the peculiar behavior of propagating `None` as a header value does not originate from this method.

### Abnormal Behavior Analysis

The root cause of the abnormal behavior where a `None` header value is not being removed is possibly located elsewhereâ€”either where headers are merged, managed initially in the session, or prepared more centrally for the request.

### Next Steps

To further trace how headers are primarily prepared and normalized, we'll focus on the `PreparedRequest.prepare_headers` method since it is a logical next step where headers may be refined before transmission. 

Let's observe this method:

```plaintext
Observed method: requests/models.py:PreparedRequest.prepare_headers
```
==================================================
Based on the tracing and observations so far, we have identified that the abnormal behavior occurs when a header value is set to `None`, and instead of removing that header, it propagates as `'Accept-Encoding: None'` in the HTTP request.

### Analysis of `PreparedRequest.prepare_headers`

The function `PreparedRequest.prepare_headers` is responsible for preparing HTTP headers, which involves creating a `CaseInsensitiveDict` of the headers. Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

1. **Conditionally Set Headers**: If headers are provided, they are transformed into a `CaseInsensitiveDict`, which maps all header names to a native string representation and pairs them with their values (line 393-394). 
   
2. **No Filtering of `None` Values**: The code simply transforms headers into the dictionary without filtering out any headers with `None` values. This means if a header value is `None`, it still becomes part of `self.headers`, exactly as presented initially.

### Identifying the Bug

The observed behavior suggests that the erroneous propagation of `None` as a header value originates from headers not being filtered correctly when they are set. We need to add logic to filter out any header values that are `None` to prevent them from being included in the headers that are sent with the HTTP request.

### Next Steps

To address this issue, we need to modify the `prepare_headers` method to filter out `None` values. This will ensure that headers with `None` are excluded from `self.headers`.

We can confirm that this method is indeed the buggy method requiring the adjustment to prevent incorrect headers from being sent.

Buggy Method: `requests/models.py:PreparedRequest.prepare_headers`

To resolve the issue in this method, we should modify the line that sets `self.headers` to filter out any headers where the value is `None`. Here's a possible adjustment:

```python
self.headers = CaseInsensitiveDict((to_native_string(name), value) for name, value in headers.items() if value is not None)
```

This change will ensure that only headers with non-`None` values are included in the prepared request headers.

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

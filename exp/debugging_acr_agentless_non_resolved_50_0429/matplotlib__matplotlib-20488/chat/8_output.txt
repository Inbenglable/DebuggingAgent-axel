Given the identified issue in the `LogNorm.__call__()` within `lib/matplotlib/colors.py`, I need to retrieve the source code for `LogNorm.__call__` to understand the transformations and address the bug. Since previous API invocations are providing the incorrect outputs, let's attempt searching for `LogNorm.__call__` in the codebase directly as it may not be in the anticipated file.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("LogNorm.__call__")
```

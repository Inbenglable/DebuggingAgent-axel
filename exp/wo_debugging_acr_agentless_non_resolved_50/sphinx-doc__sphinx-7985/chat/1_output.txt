To resolve the issue of having the linkcheck tool also check local (internal) links, we need to locate and modify the part of the code where link checking is implemented. We will likely need to explore how link targets are processed and potentially adapt the logic to include local links.

First, we should locate the relevant code that handles the link checking process. Typically, this would be in the part of the Sphinx codebase related to builders or checkers. We will start by searching for methods that handle linkchecking in the codebase.

I'll begin by searching for methods related to "linkcheck" in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("linkcheck")
```

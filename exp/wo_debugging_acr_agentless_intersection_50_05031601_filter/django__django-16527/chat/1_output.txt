To resolve the issue reported in the Django project, where the `show_save_as_new` setting in the admin is incorrectly enabled without verifying add permissions, I need to review the implementation of this setting in the `django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py` file. Specifically, I need to confirm the current conditions involved in setting `show_save_as_new`. 

Since the description suggests modifying conditions around line 102, I need to find the surrounding code to ensure accurate patch generation.

I'll run the following search to retrieve the relevant source code:

```python
search_code_in_file("django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py", "show_save_as_new")
```

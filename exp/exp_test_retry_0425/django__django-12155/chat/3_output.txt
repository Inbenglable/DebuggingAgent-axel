To generate a patch, I need to review the source code of the `trim_docstring` method located in the `django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py` file. I'll retrieve the source code for this method using the provided API.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py", "trim_docstring")
```

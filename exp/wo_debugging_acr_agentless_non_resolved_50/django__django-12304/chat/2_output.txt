To address the issue with enumeration types not being usable in Django templates, we need to add the `do_not_call_in_templates` attribute to the relevant classes in the `django/db/models/enums.py` file. Based on the previous API calls, we need to edit the following classes: `Choices`, `IntegerChoices`, and `TextChoices`. 

Since the classes themselves have been identified and given that adding a simple attribute like `do_not_call_in_templates = True` doesn't require detailed function or method retrieval, I have enough information to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

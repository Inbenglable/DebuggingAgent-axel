The error traceback indicates that the test script is attempting to use Django's ORM without having the Django settings properly configured. Specifically, the error occurs when the `TestModel` is being defined and Django tries to access the application configuration.

Analyzing the error:
- The error is raised by the line `apps.get_containing_app_config(module)` when initializing the `TestModel`, indicating that Django settings are not set up. This is because Django requires settings (including `INSTALLED_APPS`) to be configured in order to properly use models and other ORM features.

The test script needs to call `django.setup()` after configuring settings for the test to work correctly. The current script does not include this necessary setup.

Bug detection cannot continue without addressing the setup issue in the test code. However, based on the issue description ("model_to_dict() should return an empty dict for an empty list of fields"), the problem lies within `model_to_dict`.

Since the problem description points to a specific check in `model_to_dict`, if a direct code inspection was possible, the focus should be on that method. To proceed accurately with identifying the code that needs fixing, I need to find the location of `model_to_dict` method in the Django repository.

Observed method: `django/forms/models.py:model_to_dict`

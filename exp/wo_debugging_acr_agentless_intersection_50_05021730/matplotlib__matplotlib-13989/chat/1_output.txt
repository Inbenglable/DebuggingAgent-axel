To resolve the issue with the `hist()` function not respecting the `range=...` parameter when `density=True`, I need to inspect the source code of the `hist` method in Matplotlib. This will allow me to determine where the range is not being applied correctly and make the necessary modifications. Therefore, I need to search for the `hist` method within the appropriate file in the Matplotlib codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("hist")
```

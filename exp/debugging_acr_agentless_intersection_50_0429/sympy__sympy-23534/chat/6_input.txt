## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Using symbols to create functions doesn't work if there is an extra layer of parentheses
Sympy version == 1.10.1

Using `symbols` to create symbol-like objects like instances of `Function` as shown in the [documentation](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/core.html?highlight=symbols#symbols) creates objects of class `Symbol` instead of `Function` if there is an extra layer of parentheses.

The extra layer of parentheses are necessary to deconstruct the output as separate tuples.

Running the code:
```
q, u = smp.symbols(('q:2', 'u:2'), cls=smp.Function)
print(type(q[0]))
```
#### Expected result:
<class 'sympy.core.function.UndefinedFunction'>

#### Actual result: 
<class 'sympy.core.symbol.Symbol'>

</ISSUE>


A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
The observed abnormal behavior is related to the `symbols` function from `sympy.core.symbol.py`. The function should create instances of a specified class, in this case, `Function`, but it instead creates instances of `Symbol` when the input is wrapped in an extra layer of parentheses. The test indicates that running:

```python
q, u = smp.symbols(('q:2', 'u:2'), cls=smp.Function)
```

and checking the type with `type(q[0])` results in `<class 'sympy.core.symbol.Symbol'>`, whereas the expected result is an instance of `<class 'sympy.core.function.UndefinedFunction'>`.

Looking over the stack trace, it shows the control flow entering the `symbols` function in `sympy/core/symbol.py`, with the `names` parameter having an extra layer of parentheses, i.e., `('q:2', 'u:2')`. The function iterates over the provided names and calls itself recursively without taking into account that the items should be instances of the class passed as the `cls` argument. Thus, the root cause might be located where the recursive call or iteration logic doesn't respect the `cls` argument properly.

To trace this further, we should delve deeper into how `symbols` handles the input and how it distributes the `cls` argument within its logic. Therefore, the next step is to observe the behavior of the `symbols` function.

Observed method: `sympy/core/symbol.py:symbols`
==================================================
Based on the initial analysis, the observed abnormal behavior seems to stem from how the `symbols` function handles the input containing a tuple of names with specified classes, such as `Function`, and instead returns objects of type `Symbol`. The function recurses when an iterable is passed, iterating over each element with the default `Symbol` class.

Given the current runtime information and analysis of the `symbols` method, here are the possible steps for further trace investigation:

1. The observed scope in need of deeper inspection is within the iteration part of the `symbols` method, particularly where the logic decides to recurse when tuples of names are passed:

```python
792        else:
793            for name in names:
794                result.append(symbols(name, **args))
```

This section seems crucial since, instead of applying the `cls` parameter (provided as `Function`), it defaults to recursive call settings that result in `Symbol`.

Therefore, I want to trace the downstream runtime information of this section further to better identify what adjustments or conditions lead to producing instances of `Symbol` instead of `Function`.

Observed scope: `sympy/core/symbol.py:792-794`
==================================================
Based on the runtime information and tracing history, it appears that the issue lies in how the `symbols` function processes the `cls` argument when the input contains an extra level of parentheses. The observed tracing indicates that, despite `cls` being passed as `Function` in the initial call to `symbols`, the recursive calls default back to using the `Symbol` class due to the way arguments are handled or reset.

### Analysis of Observed Code:
1. **Initialization & Recursion**: When `symbols` is called with a tuple `('q:2', 'u:2')`, the function's recursive call on line 794 (`result.append(symbols(name, **args))`) does not appear to carry forward the `cls=smp.Function` specification due to reset or exclusion within `args`. This is evidenced by the runtime tracing which shows `cls` defaulting to `<class 'sympy.core.symbol.Symbol'>` instead of `<class 'sympy.core.function.UndefinedFunction'>`.

2. **Expectation & Result Mismatch**: For each element in the tuple, the expected creation of objects of type `Function` does not occur, leading to output objects of type `Symbol`.

### Expected Execution Path:
- When invoking `symbols(name, **args)`, the `cls` parameter should consistently pass as `Function` to ensure the correct class instantiation, but default behavior switches it back to `Symbol`.

### Current Bug Localization:
The bug is most likely in the handling of the `cls` argument across recursive calls within the `symbols` function. Specifically, the observed behavior suggests that this culprit lies within the following execution path when recursive calls are made and when the `names` is processed with tuple input.

There is a necessity to examine how arguments are handled when passed recursively as default arguments that do not encapsulate `cls` correctly result in instantiating the Symbols using the wrong class.

Given this, the issue seems situated within the initial handling of function argument propagation. 

Therefore, based on the available information:

    r"""
    Transform strings into instances of :class:`Symbol` class.

    :func:`symbols` function returns a sequence of symbols with names taken
    from ``names`` argument, which can be a comma or whitespace delimited
    string, or a sequence of strings::

        >>> from sympy import symbols, Function

        >>> x, y, z = symbols('x,y,z')
        >>> a, b, c = symbols('a b c')

    The type of output is dependent on the properties of input arguments::

        >>> symbols('x')
        x
        >>> symbols('x,')
        (x,)
        >>> symbols('x,y')
        (x, y)
        >>> symbols(('a', 'b', 'c'))
        (a, b, c)
        >>> symbols(['a', 'b', 'c'])
        [a, b, c]
        >>> symbols({'a', 'b', 'c'})
        {a, b, c}

    If an iterable container is needed for a single symbol, set the ``seq``
    argument to ``True`` or terminate the symbol name with a comma::

        >>> symbols('x', seq=True)
        (x,)

    To reduce typing, range syntax is supported to create indexed symbols.
    Ranges are indicated by a colon and the type of range is determined by
    the character to the right of the colon. If the character is a digit
    then all contiguous digits to the left are taken as the nonnegative
    starting value (or 0 if there is no digit left of the colon) and all
    contiguous digits to the right are taken as 1 greater than the ending
    value::

        >>> symbols('x:10')
        (x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8, x9)

        >>> symbols('x5:10')
        (x5, x6, x7, x8, x9)
        >>> symbols('x5(:2)')
        (x50, x51)

        >>> symbols('x5:10,y:5')
        (x5, x6, x7, x8, x9, y0, y1, y2, y3, y4)

        >>> symbols(('x5:10', 'y:5'))
        ((x5, x6, x7, x8, x9), (y0, y1, y2, y3, y4))

    If the character to the right of the colon is a letter, then the single
    letter to the left (or 'a' if there is none) is taken as the start
    and all characters in the lexicographic range *through* the letter to
    the right are used as the range::

        >>> symbols('x:z')
        (x, y, z)
        >>> symbols('x:c')  # null range
        ()
        >>> symbols('x(:c)')
        (xa, xb, xc)

        >>> symbols(':c')
        (a, b, c)

        >>> symbols('a:d, x:z')
        (a, b, c, d, x, y, z)

        >>> symbols(('a:d', 'x:z'))
        ((a, b, c, d), (x, y, z))

    Multiple ranges are supported; contiguous numerical ranges should be
    separated by parentheses to disambiguate the ending number of one
    range from the starting number of the next::

        >>> symbols('x:2(1:3)')
        (x01, x02, x11, x12)
        >>> symbols(':3:2')  # parsing is from left to right
        (00, 01, 10, 11, 20, 21)

    Only one pair of parentheses surrounding ranges are removed, so to
    include parentheses around ranges, double them. And to include spaces,
    commas, or colons, escape them with a backslash::

        >>> symbols('x((a:b))')
        (x(a), x(b))
        >>> symbols(r'x(:1\,:2)')  # or r'x((:1)\,(:2))'
        (x(0,0), x(0,1))

    All newly created symbols have assumptions set according to ``args``::

        >>> a = symbols('a', integer=True)
        >>> a.is_integer
        True

        >>> x, y, z = symbols('x,y,z', real=True)
        >>> x.is_real and y.is_real and z.is_real
        True

    Despite its name, :func:`symbols` can create symbol-like objects like
    instances of Function or Wild classes. To achieve this, set ``cls``
    keyword argument to the desired type::

        >>> symbols('f,g,h', cls=Function)
        (f, g, h)

        >>> type(_[0])
        <class 'sympy.core.function.UndefinedFunction'>

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

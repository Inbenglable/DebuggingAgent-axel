To resolve the issue, we need to examine how the `KMeans` class handles parallelism and whether the discrepancy in results is due to a non-deterministic behavior in the parallel execution. Specifically, I'm interested in looking at the implementation of the `KMeans` class and its fitting procedure since that is where parallelization typically happens. 

I'll search for the `KMeans` class and its `fit` method in the Scikit-learn codebase to understand how parallelism is handled and identify any potential sources of non-determinism.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("KMeans")
search_method_in_codebase("KMeans.fit")
```

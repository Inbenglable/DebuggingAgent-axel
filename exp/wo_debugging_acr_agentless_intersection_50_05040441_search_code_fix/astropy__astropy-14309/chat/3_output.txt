To resolve the `IndexError` in the `is_fits` function within the Astropy project, we need to add a check to ensure that the `args` tuple is not empty before attempting to access its elements. This way, we can prevent the `IndexError` from occurring. Here's how the patch can be formulated:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### astropy/io/fits/connect.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nreturn isinstance(args[0], (HDUList, TableHDU, BinTableHDU, GroupsHDU))\n=======\nreturn args and isinstance(args[0], (HDUList, TableHDU, BinTableHDU, GroupsHDU))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This change ensures that `args` is checked for content before attempting to access its first element, preventing an `IndexError` when the tuple is empty.

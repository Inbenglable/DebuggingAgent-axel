To address the issue, I need to determine where the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` is defined and how it is currently implemented. Specifically, I need to find the class definition for `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` in the Django codebase. This will allow me to modify it to set the `disabled` attribute to `True` by default.

I'll search for the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` class in the codebase to retrieve its source code. 

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ReadOnlyPasswordHashField")
```

Given the insights from the debugging history, I need to review the `_safe_first_finite` method from the `matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py` file before generating a patch. This way, I can ensure that I understand its current implementation and how to modify it to handle cases without finite values in the input iterable.

```python
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py", "_safe_first_finite")
```

To resolve the issue where `flush()` isn't working as expected during the migration process, I need to examine the code handling the management commands that run migrations. Specifically, I should look at how standard output and error streams are used in the relevant management command.

From the issue description and the search results, we know that migrations are handled in `MigrationExecutor`, but the problem likely originates from how output is managed in the command that calls `MigrationExecutor.migrate`.

I need to retrieve the source code for the management command that handles migration to inspect how it uses `flush()` and manage stdout/stderr. This is likely in the Django management commands related to migrations, typically located in the `django/core/management/commands/` directory or similar.

Let's locate the relevant command code to perform this analysis.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("migrate")
```

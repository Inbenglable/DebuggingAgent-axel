The provided patch modifies the `is_fits` function to include a check ensuring the `args` tuple is not empty before accessing its first element. The modification is made by changing the original line:

```python
return isinstance(args[0], (HDUList, TableHDU, BinTableHDU, GroupsHDU))
```

to:

```python
return len(args) > 0 and isinstance(args[0], (HDUList, TableHDU, BinTableHDU, GroupsHDU))
```

This change effectively prevents the `IndexError` from occurring by ensuring that `args` has elements before attempting to access `args[0]`.

**Analysis of the Test Output:**

- **Original Output:**
  The original output presents an `IndexError: tuple index out of range`, indicating that the function attempted to access an element in an empty `args` tuple.

- **Patched Output:**
  After applying the patch, the output is empty, indicating that the test completed without raising the `IndexError`, or any other exceptions for that matter.

Given the analysis, the patch resolves the issue by avoiding the `IndexError`. The patch successfully prevents attempts to access an element of an empty tuple.

Thus, based on the provided information and the effect of the patch on solving the specified problem:

Issue resolved: `True`

To resolve the issue, I need to identify relevant code that deals with `Text` objects, particularly focusing on how antialiasing is managed and where `rcParams["text.antialias"]` is accessed. Let's analyze the returned content:

1. **lib/matplotlib/text.py:Text**: This file contains the `Text` class, which is central to the issue. It includes methods related to text properties such as `set_color` that reference rcParams, so this is relevant.

2. **lib/matplotlib/dviread.py:Text**: This file includes another `Text` class, but this one is focused on glyphs in a dvi file, managing aspects of font effects and glyph positioning. Given the issue is specifically about antialiasing in `Text` objects used in rendering plots, this doesn't seem directly relevant to the problem at hand.

Based on the analysis, I need the following file:

```
lib/matplotlib/text.py:Text
```

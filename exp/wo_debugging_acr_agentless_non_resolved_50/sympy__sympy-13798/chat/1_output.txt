To address the issue reported in the Sympy project, I need to identify the code responsible for handling the `latex()` pretty-printing function, specifically where the `mul_symbol` keyword argument is processed. This functionality likely exists within a specific file related to LaTeX output or conversions in Sympy.

Since I don't have the required implementation details yet, I will search for the `latex` function's source code in the codebase to examine how the `mul_symbol` functionality is currently implemented.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("latex")
```

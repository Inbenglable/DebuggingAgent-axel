The test reproduces an issue in the `matplotlib` library where the `hist` function does not respect the specified `range` when the `density` parameter is set to `True`. This causes the bins to not start and end at the specified range boundaries, leading to an `AssertionError`.

The root cause of this issue seems to be in the logic of how bins are calculated when `density=True`. This behavior has been identified to have started with the specific commit referenced in the issue (`239be7b18e311c57a1393b6eeefc62b7cc629339`). The anomalous behavior is related to the calculation of bin edges when the histogram density is normalized.

To identify the buggy section of the code, it would be logical to investigate further into the internal workings of `plt.hist`, specifically in how it handles range and density parameters.

In this case, the observed method in question should be the hist function used in `matplotlib.pyplot`.

Observed method: `lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py:hist`

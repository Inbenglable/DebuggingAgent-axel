The error message in the output of the test, `TypeError: write() argument must be str, not bytes`, indicates that there is an issue with how the `EncodedFile` class in `capture.py` is handling write operations. The class is advertising a mode including `b` (binary), which leads external modules, like `youtube-dl`, to attempt to write bytes to it. However, the `write` method of `EncodedFile` expects a `str`, not `bytes`.

We should look at the implementation of the `EncodedFile` class in the `_pytest.capture` module, particularly focusing on the `write` method and how the mode is set or handled. This will help us understand why it advertises the mode `b` and how we might resolve the mismatch between expected data types.

Observed method: `_pytest/capture.py:EncodedFile.write`

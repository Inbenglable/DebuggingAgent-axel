## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Statement created by _create_unique_sql makes references_column always false
Description
	
This is due to an instance of Table is passed as an argument to Columns when a string is expected.

</ISSUE>


A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
The issue arises when attempting to create a mock database connection using `MockDatabaseWrapper`. The error message indicates that there's a missing required positional argument: 'settings_dict' in the constructor of the base `BaseDatabaseWrapper` class. This suggests that the `MockDatabaseWrapper` class omits this necessary argument when calling `super().__init__()`. 

The purpose of `settings_dict` is to provide configuration settings for the database connection, which are essential for initializing the `BaseDatabaseWrapper`. 

This means that the observed abnormal behavior is due to the incorrect implementation of the mocked database connection, which does not properly initialize its base class due to the missing `settings_dict`.

I will now examine the `MockDatabaseWrapper.__init__` method because that's where the error is occurring when the parent class is not being initialized correctly.

Observed method: `reproduce.py:MockDatabaseWrapper.__init__`
==================================================
Based on the information provided, the issue stems from the `MockDatabaseWrapper.__init__` method, which calls `super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)` but does not provide the necessary `settings_dict` argument required by the `BaseDatabaseWrapper` class.

The `BaseDatabaseWrapper`'s constructor expects `settings_dict` to configure the required database settings, but this argument is missing from the call in the mock subclass.

Given that the issue is related to the incorrect initialization of `MockDatabaseWrapper`, and the traceback confirms it is due to the missing positional argument, the buggy method can be identified as follows:

Buggy method: `reproduce.py:MockDatabaseWrapper.__init__`

To fix the issue, you should ensure that when initializing `MockDatabaseWrapper`, a valid `settings_dict` is passed to the superclass constructor. This can typically be a mock or minimal configuration dictionary sufficient for the logic being tested.
==================================================

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the bug, I need to inspect the source code of the method `MockDatabaseWrapper.__init__` to understand how it is currently implementing the initialization and how it can be changed to include `settings_dict`. The debugging agent has identified that this is where the problem occurs. Thus, I will proceed to retrieve the source code of the method.

```python
search_method_in_file("reproduce.py", "MockDatabaseWrapper.__init__")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_file("reproduce.py", "MockDatabaseWrapper.__init__")
RESULT:
#### reproduce.py:MockDatabaseWrapper.__init__
```python
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.features = BaseDatabaseFeatures(self)
        self.ops = BaseDatabaseOperations(self)
        self.client = BaseDatabaseClient(self)
        self.creation = BaseDatabaseCreation(self)
        self.introspection = BaseDatabaseIntrospection(self)
        self.validation = BaseDatabaseValidation(self)

```


==================================================

Your Output:
To resolve the issue, I need to understand how the `BaseDatabaseWrapper` is initialized, and specifically, what the format or structure of `settings_dict` is required for the initialization. I'm interested in examining the constructor of `BaseDatabaseWrapper` because it will provide insights into how `settings_dict` should be constructed or passed. 

Thus, I need to retrieve the source code for `BaseDatabaseWrapper.__init__` to proceed.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("BaseDatabaseWrapper.__init__")
```

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

I need to retrieve the source code for the `ReprPrinter` class methods that are responsible for printing dictionaries and sets, as these data types are not being printed correctly by `srepr`. The provided class definition does not show these specific methods. 

I'll proceed to search for methods that handle `dict` and `set` types within the `ReprPrinter` class in the `sympy/printing/repr.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/repr.py", "ReprPrinter._print_dict")
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/repr.py", "ReprPrinter._print_set")
```

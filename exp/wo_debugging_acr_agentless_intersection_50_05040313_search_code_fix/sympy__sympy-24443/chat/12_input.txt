You are a PR reviewer that needs to review the patch generated by a bug repair agent and determine whether the issue is fixed or not.
This is the bug issue, which is in the **sympy** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
`_check_homomorphism` is broken on PermutationGroups
```python
In [1]: from sympy.combinatorics import *
   ...: from sympy.combinatorics.homomorphisms import homomorphism
   ...: D3 = DihedralGroup(3)
   ...: T = homomorphism(D3, D3, D3.generators, D3.generators)

ValueError: The given images do not define a homomorphism
```

The issue is in the internal `_image()` function, where it handles the case of a `PermutationGroup`:

https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/809c53c077485ca48a206cee78340389cb83b7f1/sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py#L336-L337

When `r[i]` is an inverted generator, the `in gens` test fails.

I think the whole thing can be greatly simplified.

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
## REPRODUCE TEST
```
# reproducer.py

from sympy.combinatorics import DihedralGroup
from sympy.combinatorics.homomorphisms import homomorphism
import traceback
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        D3 = DihedralGroup(3)
        T = homomorphism(D3, D3, D3.generators, D3.generators)
        # If no exception is raised, the issue might be fixed
        print("No exception raised, the issue might be fixed.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except ValueError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The given images do not define a homomorphism")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

And this is the original output when running the test (before applying the patch):
## ORIGINAL OUTPUT

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

```

The repair agent has tried to generate a patch to fix the issue:
## PATCH CONTEXT
<PATCH_CONTEXT>
To address the issue in the `_image()` function related to `PermutationGroup`, we need to simplify the handling of inverted generators. The proposed change focuses on correcting how images of generators and their inverses are identified. Here's the patch using the SEARCH/REPLACE format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                if isinstance(domain, PermutationGroup) and r[i] in gens:\n=======\n                if isinstance(domain, PermutationGroup):\n                    if r[i] in gens:\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                elif s**-1 in images:\n                    w = w*images[s**-1]**power\n=======\n                elif (s := r[i]**-1) in images:\n                    w = w*images[s]**power\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Patch 1**: It simplifies the check for a `PermutationGroup`. Initially, when checking if `r[i]` is in `gens`, the code may mistakenly miss inverted elements. The replacement provides conditional simplification allowing easy access to the element without prematurely concluding it's not a generator.

- **Patch 2**: Modifies the approach for checking and computing with inverse generators. By using the inline assignment (using the `:=` operator), we directly assign the inverse to `s` and check if it's in `images`, simplifying the access and improving readability.

Please ensure that you test the changes in the environment to confirm they resolve the issue without introducing new problems.

After applying the patch, the output of the test is:

Now, please first review the patch and analyse the test output before and after the patch, to determine whether the issue is fixed or not.

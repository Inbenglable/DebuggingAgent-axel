To resolve the issue of the 1-element tuple being rendered incorrectly without the trailing comma, let's analyze the current observations and trace the abnormal behavior.

### Current Observations:
1. **Expected Behavior**:
   - A single-element tuple such as `(1,)` should maintain the trailing comma during the `unparse` process.

2. **Current Behavior**:
   - The single-element tuple `(1,)` is being unparsed as `(1)`, omitting the trailing comma.

3. **Current Trace and Context**:
   - The code uses `ast.unparse()` function, which invokes `_UnparseVisitor.visit()`.
   - We have identified that the `_UnparseVisitor` class is where we need to look for the behavior concerning tuple handling.

### Next Steps:
Given the problem, the next logical step is to trace and examine the methods in `_UnparseVisitor` that are related to visiting tuples within the abstract syntax tree (AST). Among these, functions with names like `visit_Tuple` or similar should handle tuple nodes.

To locate where the issue occurs, let's observe the function responsible for visiting tuples in the `_UnparseVisitor` class.

Observed method: `sphinx/pycode/ast.py:_UnparseVisitor.visit_Tuple`

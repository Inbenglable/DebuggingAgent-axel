To address the identified issue, I need to review the source code of the `MigrationLoader.load_disk` method in the file `django/db/migrations/loader.py`. This will help me understand the current implementation, specifically the check for modules with missing `__file__` attributes, and how to refine it.

Let's retrieve the source code for the `MigrationLoader.load_disk` method.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/loader.py", "MigrationLoader.load_disk")
```

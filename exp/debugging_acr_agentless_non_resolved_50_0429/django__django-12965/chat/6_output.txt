To generate the patch for the `as_sql` method in the `SQLDeleteCompiler` class, I need to retrieve the exact source code of this method. I already know the file path of the method, which is `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`, and the class name, which is `SQLDeleteCompiler`. Subsequently, I can analyze the exact logic being used and make appropriate changes to address the performance regression issue.

Here is the code to search for the method in the file:

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/sql/compiler.py", "SQLDeleteCompiler.as_sql")
```

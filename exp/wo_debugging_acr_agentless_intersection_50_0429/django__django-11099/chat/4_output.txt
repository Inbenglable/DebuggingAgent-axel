To resolve the issue, we will modify the regular expressions used in both `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` classes by replacing `^` and `$` with `\A` and `\Z` respectively. Here are the search/replace patches based on the provided source code:

```pythony
### django/contrib/auth/validators.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    regex = r'^[\w.@+-]+$'
=======
    regex = r'\A[\w.@+-]+\Z'
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

After finding identical sections in both classes (`ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator`), we just perform the same operation since they have the same regular expression format that needs modification. Below is the JSON representation of these edits:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/auth/validators.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    regex = r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'\n=======\n    regex = r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/contrib/auth/validators.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    regex = r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'\n=======\n    regex = r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

From the provided information, let's first analyze the abnormal behavior exhibited in the program:

1. **Issue Description:**
   - There is an issue with the `trim_docstring` function in the Django project where `docutils` reports an error when rendering view docstrings if the first line is not empty. This is because the first line's indentation is calculated as 0, which leads to an error. 

2. **Script Output:**
   - The test script provided aims to reproduce the issue by utilizing a function (`trim_docstring`) and verifying the output using `docutils`.
   - The script encounters an `ImportError` when trying to import `simplify_exception` from `django.contrib.admindocs.views`.

3. **Current Observations:**
   - Import failure indicates that `simplify_exception` might have been removed or renamed in the Django codebase. This error is not directly related to the `trim_docstring` function's behavior but prevents the script from running altogether.
   - Since the script is primarily focused on testing `trim_docstring`, the absence of `simplify_exception` suggests a problem or change in `django.contrib.admindocs.views`.

The immediate step is to address the import error so that the script can continue running and we can observe the behavior of `trim_docstring`.

Given the focus is on resolving the behavior in `trim_docstring`, we should proceed with tracing the execution of this function to understand why it behaves incorrectly with a non-empty first line in a docstring.

Next step:

Observed method: `django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py:trim_docstring`

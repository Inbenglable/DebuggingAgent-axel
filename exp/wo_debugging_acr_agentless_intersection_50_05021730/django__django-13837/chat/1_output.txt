To resolve the issue, I need to locate the source code of the `django.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments` method and analyze it to identify areas of improvement. Therefore, I will first search for this specific method's source code in the Django project codebase.

Since the file path isn't provided, I will invoke the API to search for the method in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("get_child_arguments")
```

The issue is in the `_image()` function within the sympy source code, specifically in the `homomorphisms.py` file. To address the problem, I need to retrieve the source code of the `_image()` function so that I can understand its current implementation and devise a fix. Once I have the source code, I can make the necessary adjustments to handle inverted generators in permutation groups properly.

I'll proceed with searching for the `_image()` function in the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py", "_image")
```

To resolve the issue, I need to understand the implementation of `kernS` in the sympy project. The issue indicates that the error occurs in the `kernS` function. Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code for the `kernS` method.

Since I don't have the file path, I will search for the method in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("kernS")
```

In analyzing the situation provided, here's the breakdown:

### Patch Analysis
The patch modifies the regex in both `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator`. Originally, both validators used the regex `r'^[\w.@+-]+$'`, which inadvertently allowed for trailing newlines due to the `$` end-of-line anchor matching a newline at the end. The proposed change was to replace this with `r'\A[\w.@+-]+\Z'`, which uses the `\A` and `\Z` anchors that match the start and end of the string respectively, and do not allow matches at a newline.

### Original Output Analysis
Prior to applying the patch, the test outputs an `AssertionError` indicating the validator did not raise an error for a username that includes a trailing newline (`validusername\n`). This confirms the bug exists as described.

### Patched Output Analysis
After the patch is applied, attempting to validate the username with a trailing newline raises a `ValidationError` from the internal Django validator, which is expected and indicates that the patch is effective in addressing the stated issue. However, there's a secondary exception related to an improperly configured Django settings environment, which is not related to the initial regex validation issue but rather to the test environment setup.

Despite the fact that there's an unrelated environment configuration error, the test results show that the `ValidationError` was indeed triggered by the patched validators, which indicates that the validators now correctly reject usernames with trailing newlines. 

### Conclusion
From the patch and the related outputs, it is clear that the specific issue with trailing newlines being allowed in usernames by `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` has been resolved.

Issue resolved: `True`

To generate the required patch, I need to retrieve the source code for the `BaseCommand.create_parser` method from the `django/core/management/base.py` file. This method is where the command-specific arguments, like `--skip-checks`, should be added.

I will proceed with retrieving the source code for this method.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/management/base.py", "BaseCommand.create_parser")
```

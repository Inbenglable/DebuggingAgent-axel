To generate the patch, I need to understand the existing implementation of the `PythonCodePrinter` class, specifically how other functions are printed. Therefore, I will retrieve the source code for the `PythonCodePrinter` class in the `sympy/printing/pycode.py` file.

```python
search_class_in_file("sympy/printing/pycode.py", "PythonCodePrinter")
```

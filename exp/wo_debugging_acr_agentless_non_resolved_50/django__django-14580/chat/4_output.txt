To generate a patch for this issue, it seems necessary to modify the part of the `as_string` method where it handles imports. Specifically, ensure that the `from django.db import models` is added appropriately.

I have already retrieved the source code for the `as_string` method, which is where the import management logic resides. Therefore, I am now ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

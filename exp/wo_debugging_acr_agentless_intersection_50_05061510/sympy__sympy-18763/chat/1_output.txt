To address the issue, I first need to identify where the LaTeX printing logic for the `Subs` class is located. Since `Subs` is a class in the SymPy library, I'll start by searching for its class definition to determine where the LaTeX representation could be managed. 

Once I identify the `Subs` class, I'll look for the method responsible for LaTeX conversionâ€”typically something like `_latex` or similar. This will allow me to understand and modify how subs expressions are parenthesized in the LaTeX output.

I'll begin by searching for the source code of the `Subs` class within the SymPy codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Subs")
```

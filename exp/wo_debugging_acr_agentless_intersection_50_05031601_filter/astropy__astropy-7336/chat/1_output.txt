The issue is related to the `units.quantity_input` decorator, which is most likely implemented in the `astropy/units/decorators.py` file given the traceback. The traceback shows an error in the `wrapper` function at line 225 of `astropy/units/decorators.py`. To generate a patch, I need to retrieve the source code of the `wrapper` function in the `decorators.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/units/decorators.py", "wrapper")
```

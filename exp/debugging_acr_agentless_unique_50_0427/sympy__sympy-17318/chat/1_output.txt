The provided issue describes an `IndexError` being raised when the `sqrtdenest` function is invoked with a specific expression. The traceback indicates that the error occurs in the `_split_gcd` function within `sympy/simplify/radsimp.py`.

From the trace, here is what happens:

1. The main method defines an expression involving complex numbers and nested square roots.
2. The `sqrtdenest` method in `sympy/simplify/sqrtdenest.py` is called with this expression.
3. Inside `sqrtdenest`, `expand_mul(sympify(expr))` is executed, expanding and simplifying the expression.
4. The `expr` undergoes denesting attempts using `_sqrtdenest0`, which calls `_sqrtdenest1`.
5. The `_sqrt_match` function in `sympy/simplify/sqrtdenest.py` calls `split_surds`.
6. The `split_surds` function calls `_split_gcd`, and `IndexError: tuple index out of range` is raised when `g = a[0]` is attempted because `a` is empty.

The function `_split_gcd` encounters a situation where the input is not as expected, either because it is improperly handling cases where no GCD is found, or the original input to `split_surds` is leading to this scenario.

Given this reasoning, the error seems to stem from `_split_gcd`. We need to review the behavior in this function to ensure it handles the case where `a` might be empty.

Therefore, the next step is to trace the behavior of `_split_gcd` to examine why `a` is empty at this point.

Observed method: `sympy/simplify/radsimp.py:_split_gcd`

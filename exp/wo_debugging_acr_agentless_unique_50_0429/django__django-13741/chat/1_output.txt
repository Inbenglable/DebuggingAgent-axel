To resolve the issue, I need to review the source code for the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` to understand how it is currently implemented and where I can set the `disabled` attribute to `True` by default. Additionally, examining the `UserChangeForm` class where this field is used might be necessary to understand the current setup, especially how it handles the password hash and the `clean_password` method.

Since the issue mentions `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` and `UserChangeForm`, I'll search for these classes in the Django codebase to see their existing implementations.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ReadOnlyPasswordHashField")
search_class_in_codebase("UserChangeForm")
```

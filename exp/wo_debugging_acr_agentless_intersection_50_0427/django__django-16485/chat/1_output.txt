To address the issue with the `floatformat` method in Django's `django.template.defaultfilters`, we need to obtain its source code to understand why it throws a `ValueError` when handling a precision of 0, especially with inputs like `'0.00'` and `Decimal('0.00')`. 

I will search for the `floatformat` function in the codebase to gather its implementation.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("floatformat")
```

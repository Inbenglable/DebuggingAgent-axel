Based on the output of the test after applying the patch, the issue has not been resolved. Here's the analysis:

1. **Original Issue**:
   - The problem was with the `_check_homomorphism` function not handling inverted generators correctly in `PermutationGroup`, resulting in a `ValueError`.

2. **Patch Details**:
   - The patch attempted to fix the problem by modifying the logic to handle inverted generators explicitly.
   - Specifically, when `r[i]`'s inverse is in `gens`, it attempted to locate the generator and use its inverse.

3. **Test Output After Patch**:
   - The output after the patch shows an `AttributeError`: `'Permutation' object has no attribute 'inverse'`.
   - This suggests that the proposed logic mistakenly assumes that the `inverse()` method can be called directly on a `Permutation` object, which appears to not be the case.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The patch has introduced a new error (`AttributeError`) without resolving the original `ValueError`.
   - Instead of fixing the issue, the current implementation results in an error due to incorrect assumptions about the methods available for `Permutation` objects.

Therefore, the issue is not resolved with the current patch:

Issue resolved: `False`

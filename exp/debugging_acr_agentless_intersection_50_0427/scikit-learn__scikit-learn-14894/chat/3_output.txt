I need to retrieve the source code of the `_sparse_fit` method in the `sklearn/svm/base.py` file to generate the patch. This method has been identified as the location of the bug, and I need to examine its code to understand the necessary changes. 

Let's search for the source code of the `_sparse_fit` method:

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/svm/base.py", "_sparse_fit")
```

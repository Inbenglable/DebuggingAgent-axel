#### ISSUE
caplog fixture doesn't restore log level after test
From the documentation at https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.0.0/logging.html#caplog-fixture, "The log levels set are restored automatically at the end of the test".
It used to work, but looks broken in new 6.0 release. Minimal example to reproduce:

```
def test_foo(caplog):
    caplog.set_level(42)

def test_bar(caplog):
    print(caplog.handler.level)
```

It prints "0" for pytest<6, "42" after.


In the previous round, you called search APIs to retrieve relevant source code that would help identify the root cause of the issue and generate a patch. However, the code you retrieved appears in multiple locations (maybe some are irrelevant but have same key). So now your task is to determine which of the retrieved contents are indeed you need, and filter out the irrelevant ones.
This is your API invocation round output:
To generate a patch for the issue described, I need to understand how the `caplog` fixture works, especially the part that handles setting and restoring log levels. This likely involves the method that sets the log level and ensures it's restored after a test.

First, I will search for the `caplog` fixture code to understand how it manipulates log levels and find the specific method or class responsible for this behavior.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("caplog")
```


And this is the corresponding API returned result (each content is started with #### FILE_PATH:NAME):
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("caplog")
RESULT:
#### src/_pytest/reports.py:BaseReport.caplog
```python
    def caplog(self) -> str:
        """Return captured log lines, if log capturing is enabled

        .. versionadded:: 3.5
        """
        return "\n".join(
            content for (prefix, content) in self.get_sections("Captured log")
        )

```

#### src/_pytest/logging.py:caplog
```python
def caplog(request: FixtureRequest) -> Generator[LogCaptureFixture, None, None]:
    """Access and control log capturing.

    Captured logs are available through the following properties/methods::

    * caplog.messages        -> list of format-interpolated log messages
    * caplog.text            -> string containing formatted log output
    * caplog.records         -> list of logging.LogRecord instances
    * caplog.record_tuples   -> list of (logger_name, level, message) tuples
    * caplog.clear()         -> clear captured records and formatted log output string
    """
    result = LogCaptureFixture(request.node)
    yield result
    result._finalize()

```



Among the API returned contents, there may be some irrelevant ones or not. So now you need to analyze each returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.
Now, please first analyze the API returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.

Then you need to choose you needed ones with the following format:
```
FILE_PATH_1:NAME_1
FILE_PATH_2:NAME_2
...
```

Note:
1. The value of FILE_PATH:NAME, must consistent with the API returned content (but remove the prefix ####).
2. You may select one or more contents, or even all of them if they are indeed you need.

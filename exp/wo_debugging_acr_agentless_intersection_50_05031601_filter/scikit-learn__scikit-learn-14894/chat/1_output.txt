To resolve the issue, we need to inspect the method `_sparse_fit` and understand how it handles the case when `support_vectors_` is empty. I'll first search for the `_sparse_fit` method in the scikit-learn codebase to locate its implementation.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("SVM._sparse_fit")
```

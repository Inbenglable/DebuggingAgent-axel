Based on the traceback, the root issue seems to occur within the argument parsing process when interpreting the short `-v` verbose option. The primary problem is that `-v` incorrectly expects an argument, whereas it should function like the `--verbose` flag, which does not require an additional argument.

The traceback points to the function where argument parsing is handled. Specifically, it proceeds through several internal methods until it reaches `_parse_command_line_configuration` in the `arguments_manager.py` file. This is where the argument parsing failure is handled and the subsequent error is triggered, as indicated by the presence of `self._arg_parser.parse_known_args` which is typical in handling command-line arguments.

Given this information, it is pertinent to inspect how the short `-v` option is processed within this path to determine precisely why it expects an argument.

Let's proceed by observing the `_parse_command_line_configuration` method because it interacts with the argument parser and seems to involve the part that triggers the error.

Observed method: `pylint/config/arguments_manager.py:_parse_command_line_configuration`

The observed output shows a `NameError` related to the `sys` module, which indicates that `sys` is not imported in the `run_debugging_test.py` file. This error prevents the script from properly running the test, and consequently, it does not address the original regex issue described in the Django validators.

To fix this, we first need to allow the test to run by importing `sys` in the debugging script. The original issue in the Django `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` is a mismatch in the regex pattern, where `$` should be replaced with `\Z` to avoid accepting usernames with trailing newlines.

Since we need to resolve the import issue first in the test script, and then check the regex in the Django validators, the next steps would be:

1. Ensure that `sys` is imported in the `run_debugging_test.py` script to address the immediate runtime error.
2. Re-run the test to see if it catches the problematic regex.
3. If the test runs correctly, address the faulty regex in the Django validators.

For now, I'll focus on fixing the immediate `NameError` issue before dealing with the regular expressions inside django.contrib.auth.validators.

Observed method: `run_debugging_test.py:debugging_test_execution_wrapper`

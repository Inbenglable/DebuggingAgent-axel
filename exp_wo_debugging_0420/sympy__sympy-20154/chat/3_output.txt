To resolve the issue of reusing the same dictionary object each time in the `partitions` function, I'll modify the function to yield a copy of the dictionary. This change ensures that each dictionary is independent of others in the iteration.

Here are the changes to be made:

```pythony
### sympy/utilities/iterables.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        yield sum(ms.values()), ms
=======
        yield sum(ms.values()), ms.copy()
>>>>>>> REPLACE

### sympy/utilities/iterables.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        yield ms
=======
        yield ms.copy()
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

And here is the JSON representation of the change:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/utilities/iterables.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        yield sum(ms.values()), ms\n=======\n        yield sum(ms.values()), ms.copy()\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### sympy/utilities/iterables.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        yield ms\n=======\n        yield ms.copy()\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This change will ensure that each yielded dictionary object is independent, preventing unintended modifications when collected into a list or when used in other ways.

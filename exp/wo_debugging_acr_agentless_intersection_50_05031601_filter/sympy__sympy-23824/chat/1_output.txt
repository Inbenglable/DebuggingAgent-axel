To resolve the mentioned issue in the `kahane_simplify()` function, I need to first retrieve the source code for this function to analyze how it handles the gamma matrix order. Since no specific file path is provided in the issue, I will search for the function in the entire codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("kahane_simplify")
```

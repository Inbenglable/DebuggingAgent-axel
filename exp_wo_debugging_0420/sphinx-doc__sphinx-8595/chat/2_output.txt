To address the issue of autodoc ignoring an empty `__all__` attribute, it is likely necessary to modify the `filter_members` method in the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` module. Before proceeding to generate a patch, I need to search for the relevant parts in the code that specifically deal with the `__all__` attribute. This would help to ensure that when `__all__` is empty, members are not included.

Since the `filter_members` method involves filtering members based on various criteria, ensuring that it respects an empty `__all__` attribute when `want_all` is true is likely pertinent to the fix. I'll need to further investigate how `__all__` is handled currently.

```python
search_code_in_file("sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py", "__all__")
```

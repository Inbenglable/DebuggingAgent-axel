To resolve the current issue, the `deconstruct` method of `FileField` in `django/db/models/fields/files.py` needs to be analyzed to understand how it handles the `storage` attribute, particularly when the storage is a callable returning `default_storage`. Since this method was identified as potentially problematic, I'd need to retrieve its source code to create an accurate patch.

Therefore, I'll search for the `deconstruct` method in the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/fields/files.py", "FileField.deconstruct")
```

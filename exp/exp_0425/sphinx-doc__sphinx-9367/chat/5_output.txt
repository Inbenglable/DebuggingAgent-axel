### Analysis

The issue arises from the `visit_Tuple` method in the `_UnparseVisitor` class. This method is responsible for converting the AST tuple node back into its string representation. 

### Current Observations:

1. **Code Execution**:
   - When `visit_Tuple` is called with a tuple node, it checks if `node.elts` is non-empty to determine the string representation.
   - It constructs the output by joining the string representations of the elements within the tuple with `", "` and then adding parentheses around them.

2. **Observed Behavior**:
   - For a single-element tuple like `(1,)`, the method joins the element `1` without a comma, resulting in the output `(1)` instead of `(1,)`.

3. **Root Cause**:
   - The method does not account for a special case of single-element tuples, which require a trailing comma to distinguish them from grouped expressions.

### Conclusion:

The buggy code is located within the `visit_Tuple` method of the `_UnparseVisitor` class in the file `sphinx/pycode/ast.py`. 

### Buggy Method Location:

Buggy method: `sphinx/pycode/ast.py:visit_Tuple`

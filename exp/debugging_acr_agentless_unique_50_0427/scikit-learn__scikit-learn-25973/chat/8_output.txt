To resolve the issue of a generator being exhausted when used as the cross-validation split input (`cv`) for the `SequentialFeatureSelector`, I'll modify how the `cv` parameter is handled within the `_get_best_new_feature_score` method. I will ensure it converts the `cv` generator to a list, thus allowing it to be reused.

Here's the patch in the required format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sklearn/feature_selection/_sequential.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                estimator,\n                X_new,\n                y,\n                cv=self.cv,\n                scoring=self.scoring,\n=======\n                estimator,\n                X_new,\n                y,\n                cv=list(self.cv) if isinstance(self.cv, Generator) else self.cv,\n                scoring=self.scoring,\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch checks if `self.cv` is a generator and, if so, converts it into a list to guarantee reusability during cross-validation in `cross_val_score`.

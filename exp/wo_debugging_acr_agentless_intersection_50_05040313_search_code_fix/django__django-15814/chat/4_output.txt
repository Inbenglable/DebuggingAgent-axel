To resolve the issue of `QuerySet.only()` crashing after `select_related()` on proxy models in Django, the solution involves changing the way metadata is accessed in the `Query` class. Specifically, we need to modify how Django retrieves model options when dealing with proxy models. The error can be fixed by ensuring that the concrete model's metadata is used.

Here is the necessary patch in the *SEARCH/REPLACE* format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/sql/query.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                opts = cur_model._meta\n=======\n                opts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch modifies how model options are retrieved by replacing the current metadata access with one that retrieves the concrete model's metadata, addressing the ValueError encountered under the given circumstances.

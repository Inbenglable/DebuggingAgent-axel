To resolve the issue of migration import ordering in Django, we are looking for the code implicated in writing migration files. The method related to writing migration files or their contents is what we need.

Upon examining the results, here's my analysis:

- `tests/builtin_server/tests.py:ServerHandler.write` looks related to server handling rather than migrations.
- `django/core/management/base.py:OutputWrapper.write` deals with output management for the console or logs, which is not specific to writing migration files.
- `django/core/files/base.py:ContentFile.write` is related to writing to a file, but in the context of file handling within Django's file storage.
- `django/core/files/storage/memory.py:InMemoryFileNode.write` is similarly concerned with memory-based file storage.
- `django/utils/feedgenerator.py:Atom1Feed.write` involves feed generation, not relevant to migrations.
- `django/http/response.py:HttpResponse.write` is about HTTP response management.
- `django/test/client.py:FakePayload.write` is related to test client payload handling.
- `django/contrib/gis/geos/prototypes/io.py:WKBWriter.write` seems to be related to writing geometry data in GIS.

None of the listed write methods appear to directly handle migration file generation or import ordering as per the issue description related to Django migrations.

Overall conclusion: None of the search results explicitly match the task of writing Django migration files based on the descriptions. New approaches might be required for identifying the relevant code.

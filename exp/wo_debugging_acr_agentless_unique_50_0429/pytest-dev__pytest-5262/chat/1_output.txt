To address the issue, I need to inspect the `_pytest.capture.EncodedFile` class as well as its `write` method to ensure that they are correctly processing data types and that their mode doesn't incorrectly advertise as `binary`. 

Thus, I need to retrieve the source code for the `_pytest.capture.EncodedFile` class and its `write` method.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("EncodedFile")
search_method_in_codebase("EncodedFile.write")
```

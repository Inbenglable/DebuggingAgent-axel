To address the issue of adding DISTINCT support to the Avg and Sum aggregates in the Django project, I need to modify the class definitions to allow the DISTINCT parameter. Typically, in Django's aggregation framework, this is achieved by setting an attribute that indicates the support for DISTINCT within the aggregate class.

To understand exactly how this attribute is integrated, I need to see if the `Aggregate` class has relevant methods or attributes that manage DISTINCT functionality. This may involve retrieving the source code for the `Aggregate` class.

Therefore, I will search for the code of the `Aggregate` class.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Aggregate")
```

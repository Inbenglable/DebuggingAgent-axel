To create a patch for the reported issue, we'll modify the `add_fields` method within the `django/forms/formsets.py` file to properly handle the case when `index` is `None`. This will involve checking that the `index` is not `None` before performing the comparison.

Here's the generated patch in the SEARCH/REPLACE format:

```pythony
### django/forms/formsets.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or index < initial_form_count):
=======
        if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or (index is not None and index < initial_form_count)):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, here's the JSON representation of this patch:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/forms/formsets.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or index < initial_form_count):\n=======\n        if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or (index is not None and index < initial_form_count)):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

To determine which API results are relevant, I need to focus on where the migration files are generated and where the imports within those files are specifically managed. My interest is in the actual code that manipulates the import statements during the migration file generation process, not the import statements themselves within existing migration files or unrelated test cases.

From the results, the following file is of interest:
- `django/db/migrations/writer.py:171-177`: This snippet seems to directly address the handling of import statements within migrations, particularly through the `imports` set and sorting them, likely in the `MigrationWriter` class. It seems relevant to the modification of import order.

Therefore, here is a list of the relevant file:
```
django/db/migrations/writer.py:171-177
```

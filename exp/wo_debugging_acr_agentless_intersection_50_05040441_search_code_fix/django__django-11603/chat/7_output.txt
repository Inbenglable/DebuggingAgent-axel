To determine if the issue is resolved, let's analyze both the patch and the test outputs.

### Patch Analysis

The patch introduces the `allow_distinct = True` attribute to both the `Avg` and `Sum` classes in the `django/db/models/aggregates.py` file. This change seems consistent with the issue described, where `DISTINCT` support for `Avg` and `Sum` aggregates is requested, similar to existing support for other aggregates.

### Test Output Analysis

#### Original Output

Before applying the patch, the error was `django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet.` This error does not seem directly related to the `DISTINCT` support for `Avg` and `Sum`. Rather, it indicates a configuration issue where Django apps aren't properly initialized, which would prevent any tests from being run correctly.

#### Patched Output

The same error persists after applying the patch: `django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet.` This suggests that the patch did not address the configuration error impeding test execution. The specific tests for `Avg` and `Sum` with `DISTINCT` are not being reached or assessed.

### Conclusion

The primary issue (adding DISTINCT support to Avg and Sum) may have been addressed in the code by the patch. However, the reproducible test cannot be used to verify this fix due to the persistent app registry error, which is unrelated to the target issue and remains unresolved.

Therefore, as the test outcomes can't attest to the functionality change, and we lack further evidence of successful application, we must conclude:

Issue resolved: `False`

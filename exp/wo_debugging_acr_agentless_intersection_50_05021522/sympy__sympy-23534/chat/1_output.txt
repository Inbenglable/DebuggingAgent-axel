To analyze and resolve the issue, I need to understand how the `symbols` function is implemented in the Sympy library, as this is the function that is not behaving as expected when it has an extra layer of parentheses in the arguments.

Therefore, I need to examine the source code of the `symbols` function.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("symbols")
```

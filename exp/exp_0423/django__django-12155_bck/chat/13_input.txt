You are a PR reviewer that needs to review the patch generated by a bug repair agent and determine whether the issue is fixed or not.
This is the bug issue, which is in the **django** project:
#### ISSUE
docutils reports an error rendering view docstring when the first line is not empty
Description
	
Currently admindoc works correctly only with docstrings where the first line is empty, and all Django docstrings are formatted in this way.
However usually the docstring text starts at the first line, e.g.:
def test():
	"""test tests something.
	"""
and this cause an error:
Error in "default-role" directive:
no content permitted.
.. default-role:: cmsreference
The culprit is this code in trim_docstring:
indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())
The problem is that the indentation of the first line is 0.
The solution is to skip the first line:
indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())
Thanks.


Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
import traceback
import sys
from django.contrib.admindocs.utils import trim_docstring
from docutils import core

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_trim_docstring_issue():
    def test_function():
        """test tests something.
        """
        pass

    docstring = test_function.__doc__
    processed_docstring = trim_docstring(docstring)

    try:
        rst_content = f".. default-role:: cmsreference\n\n{processed_docstring}"
        core.publish_string(rst_content, writer_name='html')
        print("No error raised, issue might be fixed.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Error in processing docstring with non-empty first line.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_trim_docstring_issue()


And this is the original output when running the test (before applying the patch):
No error raised, issue might be fixed.


The repair agent has tried to generate a patch to fix the issue:
To resolve the issue where an error occurs rendering docstrings when the first line is not empty, we will update the `trim_docstring` function in `django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py`. The change involves adjusting the calculation of indentation to skip the first line, as proposed in the issue description. Below is the patch to address the problem:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())\n=======\n        indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This edit replaces the method to calculate the minimum indentation in the `trim_docstring` function, ensuring that the indentation calculation skips the first line of the docstring, thus resolving the reported error.

After applying the patch, the output of the test is:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-12155/debugging_test.py", line 35, in <module>
    test_trim_docstring_issue()
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-12155/debugging_test.py", line 23, in test_trim_docstring_issue
    processed_docstring = trim_docstring(docstring)
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-12155/django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py", line 37, in trim_docstring
    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())
ValueError: min() arg is an empty sequence


Now, please first review the patch and analyse the test output before and after the patch, to determine whether the issue is fixed or not.

And finally, tell me whether the issue is fixed or not by replying with:
Issue resolved: `True/False`

To determine if the issue is resolved, let's review the provided patch and test outputs before and after applying the patch.

### Analysis of the Patch

- **Problem:** The issue is that non-dimensional coordinates are demoted to variables during the `Coarsen.construct` method in xarray.
- **Solution in Patch:** 
  - The patch changes the logic in the `Coarsen.construct` method.
  - Initially, only the coordinates that are based on the dimensions used in the `coarsen` operation (`window_dim`) were retained as coordinates.
  - The patch adds logic to include any non-dimensional coordinates from the original object (`self.obj.coords`) in addition to those based on the `window_dim`.
  - This new logic updates `should_be_coords` to include these non-dimensional coordinates, ensuring they remain as coordinates in the result.

### Test Outputs

- **Original Output (Before Patch):** 
  - The test fails with an `AssertionError`.
  - This indicates that the 'day' coordinate was demoted to a variable, confirming the issue described.

- **Patched Output (After Patch):** 
  - The test outputs "The issue is fixed."
  - No assertion errors are raised, suggesting that the coordinate 'day' remains as a coordinate after the `construct` operation.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis of what the patch does and the change in test output before and after applying the patch, it seems the patch resolves the problem of non-dimensional coordinates being demoted to variables.

**Issue resolved: `True`**

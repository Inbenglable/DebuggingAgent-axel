<ISSUE>
Removing a default header of a session
[The docs](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#session-objects) say that you can prevent sending a session header by setting the headers value to None in the method's arguments. You would expect (as [discussed on IRC](https://botbot.me/freenode/python-requests/msg/10788170/)) that this would work for session's default headers, too:

``` python
session = requests.Session()
# Do not send Accept-Encoding
session.headers['Accept-Encoding'] = None
```

What happens is that "None"  gets sent as the value of header.

```
Accept-Encoding: None
```

For the reference, here is a way that works:

``` python
del session.headers['Accept-Encoding']
```

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
To begin resolving this issue, let's first break down what we know from the description and the trace:

### Problem Summary:
- The issue arises when trying to prevent sending a session header (`Accept-Encoding` in this case) by setting it to `None`.
- The expected behavior, according to the documentation, is that setting a header to `None` should prevent it from being sent.
- Instead, `None` is sent as a string value in the header (`Accept-Encoding: None`).
- A test script reproduces this behavior, and a traceback shows that this leads to a `TypeError: expected string or bytes-like object`.

The traceback is particularly helpful in understanding where this error occurs:
- The error surfaces during the HTTP request preparation/sending process. 
- Specifically, it occurs when `http.client.putheader` method is called within the Python standard library, indicating a non-string header value is being handled improperly.

### Analysis and Hypothesis:
- The method `__setitem__` of `CaseInsensitiveDict` is storing the `None` value directly, without handling the conversion or removal of headers set to `None`.
- During the preparation of the HTTP request, these `None` values are likely treated as objects that cannot be encoded or that contradict expected types.

To narrow down the bug further, we should investigate how the session headers are being processed and converted into the final HTTP request. The critical observation will be checking where header values are formatted for sending.

### Next Step:
We should trace how the headers are processed from the session to the HTTP request. This involves looking at how the session headers are utilized at the point of making a request.

Therefore, the next logical step is to observe the method responsible for preparing the request:
- **File:** `requests/sessions.py`
- **Method:** Responsible for request preparation, probably involves `Session.request` or `Session.prepare_request`.

Let's observe the likely candidate:
```plaintext
Observed method: requests/sessions.py:Session.request
```
==================================================
Based on the problem summary and the analysis step, the error trace suggests that the issue arises from incorrect handling of `None` values within the session headers. 

In the runtime information for `Session.request`, we see that a `TypeError` is raised when attempting to use `http.client.putheader`. This indicates that the header values are being passed improperly when they are assigned `None` in the session headers.

From the `Session.request` method code, the constructed `Request` object is passed to `self.prepare_request(req)`:

```python
357    prep = self.prepare_request(req)
```

The issue likely stems from how these headers are processed during the preparation of the request, which is downstream from `Session.request`.

To further trace this behavior, it's logical to dive into how `prepare_request` processes the headers:

### Next Step:
Let's observe deeper into how the request preparation handles the session headers before the request is sent:

Observed scope: `requests/sessions.py:357-358`

This scope includes the call to `self.prepare_request(req)`, which prepares the headers for the actual HTTP request. Understanding this sequence will help identify how `None` values are handled in headers.
==================================================
Based on the observed runtime information, we continue to see that the error `TypeError: expected string or bytes-like object` occurs when a header value of `None` is passed during the HTTP request processing. It appears this happens during the invocation of the `putheader` method within the `http.client` module.

Currently, we are observing the `Session.request` method, which calls `self.prepare_request(req)` at line 357. The error likely originates downstream, specifically during the preparation of the headers before the request is sent. Given the indentation and method call hierarchy, the `Request` object becomes problematic when its headers are finalized and handed off to make the HTTP call.

### Analysis:
The preparation of the request in `prepare_request()` doesn't appear to clean or exclude headers set to `None`. It might be directly setting or copying them without modification, which results in sending out headers containing `None`.

### Next Steps:
To further narrow down the exact location of the fault, we should:
- Examine the `Request` preparation steps inside the `prepare_request` method.
- Investigate how headers are processed, copied, or transformed prior to executing the HTTP request, especially focusing on how `None` values are treated.
  
Let's proceed by observing the `prepare_request` method to trace how headers are handled:

Observed method: `requests/sessions.py:Session.prepare_request`
==================================================
Let's analyze the current observed code in the `Session.prepare_request` method and the reported runtime information.

### Analysis:

The `Session.prepare_request` method constructs a `PreparedRequest` object with various settings pulled from both the `Request` instance and the `Session` object. Among these settings, the headers are processed using `merge_setting`.

```python
p.prepare(
    method=request.method.upper(),
    url=request.url,
    files=request.files,
    data=request.data,
    headers=merge_setting(request.headers, self.headers, dict_class=CaseInsensitiveDict),
    params=merge_setting(request.params, self.params),
    auth=merge_setting(auth, self.auth),
    cookies=merged_cookies,
    hooks=merge_hooks(request.hooks, self.hooks),
)
```

The `headers` attribute in the `PreparedRequest` is processed by calling `merge_setting`, which likely combines the headers from the request and session, returning a `CaseInsensitiveDict`.

The error we observe (`TypeError: expected string or bytes-like object`) suggests that `None` values are being processed improperly when headers are translated for HTTP transmission, specifically when `http.client.putheader` is called with `None`.

Given the merge step does not explicitly handle or remove headers set to `None`, it reasonably results in headers containing `None` values.

### Hypothesis:
The root of the issue likely lies within the handling of header values when calling `p.prepare` in `Session.prepare_request`. The headers being merged do not undergo validation or adjustment to remove `None` values.

### Next Step:
To further narrow down the exact location of the fault, we should investigate deeper into how headers in the `PreparedRequest` are processed when the `prepare` method is called.

Observed scope: `requests/models.py:PreparedRequest.prepare`
Since the `PreparedRequest.prepare` method is responsible for preparing the HTTP-ready headers, it is critical to locating how `None` values travel through the process without being excluded or converted.

---

Let's trace the abnormal behavior further by observing the preparation of headers in `PreparedRequest.prepare` to locate where the faulty code resides.
==================================================
Let's analyze the code and the runtime information provided for the `PreparedRequest.prepare` method. 

### Code Analysis:

The `prepare` method in `PreparedRequest` is responsible for preparing the request components, including headers, method, URL, cookies, etc. In the current trace:

```python
295    self.prepare_headers(headers)
```

This line specifically calls the `prepare_headers` method, which is likely responsible for setting up the HTTP headers for the request. The behavior observed in the error trace indicates that `None` values are not being handled properly within these headers.

### Runtime Error Observed:

The runtime traceback shows that the `TypeError` occurs when trying to use the `http.client.putheader` method with a header value that is `None`. This suggests that somewhere in the process of preparing or finalizing the headers, `None` values are not being filtered out or converted to empty strings as necessary.

### Next Steps:

To locate the root cause, we need to dive deeper into how the `prepare_headers` method handles the headers, specifically focusing on how it deals with `None` values. This will help identify where the `None` values are slipping through unconverted into the final header dictionary.

Therefore, the next observed scope should be:

Observed scope: `requests/models.py:PreparedRequest.prepare_headers`

This will provide clarity on how headers are processed during preparation and allow us to identify the exact point at which the faulty code is causing `None` values to persist in the headers.
==================================================
Based on the analysis of the current observed code and the provided runtime information for the `PreparedRequest.prepare_headers` method, we can draw the following conclusions:

### Code Analysis:
- The `prepare_headers` method serves to prepare HTTP headers by converting the provided `headers` dictionary into a `CaseInsensitiveDict`.
- The line of interest in this method is:
  ```python
  self.headers = CaseInsensitiveDict((to_native_string(name), value) for name, value in headers.items())
  ```
  This line is responsible for creating a `CaseInsensitiveDict` by converting the header names to native strings and directly assigning the header values.

### Runtime Error:
- The error `TypeError: expected string or bytes-like object` indicates that there is a problem with the value being processed within the HTTP request headers. Specifically, it suggests that non-string or `None` values are present in the headers, leading to the error when `http.client.putheader` is called.
- This situation likely arises because the `prepare_headers` method does not filter out or handle `None` values, and such values are instead passed directly to this method.

### Hypothesis:
- Since the `prepare_headers` method does not handle `None` values set in the headers, they get processed as `None`. This results in `None` being sent as a header value (`Accept-Encoding: None`), causing the `TypeError`.

### Buggy Method:
Given this analysis, the `prepare_headers` method in `requests/models.py` is the method where the bug exists, as it directly deals with the processing of header values that eventually lead to the error.

Buggy method: `requests/models.py:PreparedRequest.prepare_headers`
==================================================


Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

To add DISTINCT support to the `Avg` and `Sum` aggregate classes, I have identified that the `Aggregate` parent class contains logic related to allowing DISTINCTs, particularly with the `allow_distinct` attribute and the use of `distinct` in its SQL template. In order to enable DISTINCT support for `Avg` and `Sum`, we should ensure that the `allow_distinct` attribute is set to `True` in these classes.

I have gathered enough information, including the relevant portions of the `Aggregate` class dealing with DISTINCTs, to proceed with the generation of the patch for the required changes.

Ready generation: `True`

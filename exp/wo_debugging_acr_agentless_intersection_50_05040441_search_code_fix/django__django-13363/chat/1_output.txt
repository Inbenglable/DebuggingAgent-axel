To fix the issue mentioned, the first step is to review the implementation of the `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` methods, specifically to understand how and where the `tzinfo` parameter is being handled. We already have information regarding the problematic line numbers and file path. Let me retrieve the relevant code to understand the existing implementation and decide what changes are necessary:

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncDate")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncTime")
```

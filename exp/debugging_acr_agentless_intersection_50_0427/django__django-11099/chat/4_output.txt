The issue with the `RegexValidator` initialization is related to the regular expression pattern used in the `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` for validating usernames. From the analysis, the current regex pattern allows strings ending with a newline character, which is unintended behavior. This is mainly because the regex pattern uses the `$` anchor, which matches the end of the line in Python, including a trailing newline.

Given this context, the correction should be implemented in the definitions of the regex patterns used by these validators to ensure they use `\A` and `\Z` for matching the start and end of the string, ensuring no trailing newline is matched.

The current scope of observation, `RegexValidator.__init__`, confirms how the pattern is compiled but more importantly, the issue arises from the regex pattern assigned to the `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator`. Let's trace back to where these validators are set up and initialized to ensure they use the correct pattern.

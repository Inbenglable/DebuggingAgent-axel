To resolve the issue, I need to gather more information about how duration expressions are handled in both SQLite and MySQL backend operations. This will help understand the context in which the error happens and determine whether changes are needed in those specific backend modules as well. 

Next, I'll check the handling of DurationField by looking into the backend operations for both MySQL and SQLite to see if there are specific conversions or adjustments that need attention.

Additionally, I've realized that I need to understand more about how expressions involving DurationField (`F` expressions) are evaluated and stored in these databases, which involves exploring relevant definitions or implementations specific to these backends.
Let me gather the necessary source code for these components.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py", "SQLiteDatabaseOperations")
search_class_in_file("django/db/backends/mysql/base.py", "MySQLDatabaseOperations")
search_code_in_file("django/db/backends/base/operations.py", "convert_durationfield_value")
```

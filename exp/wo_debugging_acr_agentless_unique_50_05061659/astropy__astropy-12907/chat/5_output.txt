To address the issue of incorrect computation of the separability matrix for nested compound models in Astropy, we will make modifications to the `_separable` function logic.

The issue arises because the separability calculation does not account properly for nested compound models. Particularly, we need to refine how we compute separability for nested `CompoundModel` instances by ensuring that the separability of nested models respects the hierarchy correctly, adjusting how matrices are combined.

By changing the way compound model separabilities are computed, we ensure that the boolean matrix is calculated accurately even in nested scenarios.

Here is the patch for the fix:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### astropy/modeling/separable.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        return _operators[transform.op](sepleft, sepright)\n=======\n        op_func = _operators[transform.op]\n        comp_matrix = op_func(sepleft, sepright)\n        # Ensure the compound matrix accounts for nested structure\n        if transform.n_inputs > sepleft.shape[1]:\n            left_matrix = np.zeros((sepleft.shape[0], transform.n_inputs), dtype=bool)\n            right_matrix = np.zeros((sepright.shape[0], transform.n_inputs), dtype=bool)\n            left_matrix[..., :sepleft.shape[1]] = sepleft\n            right_matrix[..., -sepright.shape[1]:] = sepright\n            comp_matrix = op_func(left_matrix, right_matrix)\n        return comp_matrix\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Original Logic:**
   - The original logic combined the separability matrices of the left and right submodels directly using `_operators`.

2. **Enhanced Logic:**
   - Added extra logic to create a `left_matrix` and `right_matrix` with dimensions matching the parent transform when the parent has more inputs, ensuring the matrices fit correctly within nested layers.
   - This ensures that the separability is checked accurately, including how nested models might change the dependencies between inputs and outputs. 

This patch improves the accuracy of the separability matrix, particularly for nested compound models, by making sure that the correct dimensions and relations are considered when computing separable matrices from nested models.

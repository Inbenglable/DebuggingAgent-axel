The issue is not resolved. Let's break down why:

1. **Patch Review:**

    - The patch attempts to add `set_antialiased` and `get_antialiased` methods to the `Text` class, and modify the `RendererAgg.draw_text` method to properly apply per-artist antialias settings.
    
    - There is a modification in the `__init__` method of the `Text` class to assign `self._antialiased` using the default `mpl.rcParams['text.antialiased']`.
    
    - Additional functions `set_antialiased()` and `get_antialiased()` are inserted before `set_text()`.

    - There is an adjustment in `backend_agg.py` to use the newly introduced `get_antialiased()` method.

2. **Patched Test Output:**

    - The syntax error shows up inside the `matplotlib/text.py` file. It looks like the `_antialiased` line is out of place because there's an inconsistent indentation or placement, causing a `SyntaxError`.

    - Due to this syntax error, the codebase fails to execute, and the updated test output is not reached or assessed beyond the import stage.

3. **Conclusion:**

    - The patch contains a critical syntax flaw preventing execution, and hence, we cannot ascertain if the intended functionality for setting and getting antialias settings has been achieved.
    
    - Since the patch introduces a syntax error that prevents any testing of the new functionalities, the issue is not resolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

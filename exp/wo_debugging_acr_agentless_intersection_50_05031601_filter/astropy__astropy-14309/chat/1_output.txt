To resolve this issue, I need to inspect the source code for the `is_fits` function in the `connect.py` file and understand how `identify_format` is handling inputs. Additionally, the comment suggests a recent commit may be relevant, so examining that specific code change may also be helpful.

Let's start by retrieving the necessary source code:

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/io/fits/connect.py", "is_fits")
search_method_in_codebase("identify_format")
search_code_in_codebase("2a0c5c6f5b982a76615c544854cd6e7d35c67c7f")
```

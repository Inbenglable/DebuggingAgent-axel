## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Add DISTINCT support for Avg and Sum aggregates.
Description
	
As an extension of #28658, aggregates should be supported for other general aggregates such as Avg and Sum. Before 2.2, these aggregations just ignored the parameter, but now throw an exception.
This change would just involve setting these classes as allowing DISTINCT, and could also be applied to Min and Max (although pointless).

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To address the issue of adding `DISTINCT` support for `Avg` and `Sum` aggregates as described, I would need to inspect the Django source code to understand how these aggregate classes are implemented and determine where to allow `DISTINCT`. Specifically, I'll look into the `Avg` and `Sum` aggregate implementations, and possibly other related aggregates in Django's ORM.

First, I should locate and review the `Avg` and `Sum` classes or methods to understand how they are currently structured and how they handle the distinct parameter.

Let's start by locating these classes in the codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Avg")
search_class_in_codebase("Sum")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_class_in_codebase("Avg")
RESULT:
#### django/db/models/aggregates.py:Avg
```python
class Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):
    function = 'AVG'
    name = 'Avg'
```


### API INVOKE: search_class_in_codebase("Sum")
RESULT:
#### django/db/models/aggregates.py:Sum
```python
class Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):
    function = 'SUM'
    name = 'Sum'
```


==================================================

Your Output:
To resolve the issue, I need to access the definitions of the `Avg` and `Sum` classes, as these are the target areas where DISTINCT support needs to be added. Since I have already located the class names along with their file paths, I will now retrieve their source code for review.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Avg")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Sum")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Avg")
RESULT:
#### django/db/models/aggregates.py:Avg
```python
class Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):
    function = 'AVG'
    name = 'Avg'
```


### API INVOKE: search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Sum")
RESULT:
#### django/db/models/aggregates.py:Sum
```python
class Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):
    function = 'SUM'
    name = 'Sum'
```


==================================================

Your Output:
To add DISTINCT support for the `Avg` and `Sum` aggregate classes, I need to identify where the DISTINCT keyword is meant to be utilized or checked within their implementation. Given the structure of these classes, I need to look for any place in the base `Aggregate` class or any attributes that determine whether DISTINCT is allowed or utilized in aggregates.

Since I haven't checked the full details of the `Aggregate` class or any existing attributes handling DISTINCT support, I'll need to retrieve the source code of the `Aggregate` class as well, since it's likely where the DISTINCT support logic will be most relevantly applied.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Aggregate")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Aggregate")
RESULT:
#### django/db/models/aggregates.py:Aggregate
```python
class Aggregate(Func):
    template = '%(function)s(%(distinct)s%(expressions)s)'
    contains_aggregate = True
    name = None
    filter_template = '%s FILTER (WHERE %%(filter)s)'
    window_compatible = True
    allow_distinct = False

    def __init__(self, *expressions, distinct=False, filter=None, **extra):
        ...

    def get_source_fields(self):
        ...

    def get_source_expressions(self):
        ...

    def set_source_expressions(self, exprs):
        ...

    def resolve_expression(self, query=None, allow_joins=True, reuse=None, summarize=False, for_save=False):
        ...

    @property
    def default_alias(self):
        ...

    def get_group_by_cols(self, alias=None):
        ...

    def as_sql(self, compiler, connection, **extra_context):
        ...

    def _get_repr_options(self):
        ...
```


==================================================

Your Output:
To add DISTINCT support to the `Avg` and `Sum` aggregate classes, I have identified that the `Aggregate` parent class contains logic related to allowing DISTINCTs, particularly with the `allow_distinct` attribute and the use of `distinct` in its SQL template. In order to enable DISTINCT support for `Avg` and `Sum`, we should ensure that the `allow_distinct` attribute is set to `True` in these classes.

I have gathered enough information, including the relevant portions of the `Aggregate` class dealing with DISTINCTs, to proceed with the generation of the patch for the required changes.

Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

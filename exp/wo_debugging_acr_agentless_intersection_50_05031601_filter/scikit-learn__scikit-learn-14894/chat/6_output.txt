### Patch Review

The patch provided introduces a check to handle zero support vectors (`n_SV == 0`). Specifically, it:

1. Checks if the number of support vectors (`n_SV`) is zero.
2. If true, it assigns an empty sparse matrix to `self.dual_coef_` with the shape `(n_class, 0)`.
3. If `n_SV` is not zero, the existing process is followed where division is performed.

This approach ensures that a `ZeroDivisionError` is avoided when `n_SV` is zero.

### Test Output Analysis

#### Original Output
The original output demonstrates a `ZeroDivisionError` when trying to fit the sparse dataset with an empty `support_vectors_`, verifying the presence of the bug.

#### Patched Output
The patched output is empty, which indicates that the code executed without any exceptions, including `ZeroDivisionError`. This suggests that the patch successfully prevented the division by zero error for the given test case.

### Conclusion

The patch correctly addresses the issue by ensuring that division is not attempted when the number of support vectors is zero. The absence of errors in the patched output confirms that the problem is resolved for the provided test scenario.

Issue resolved: `True`

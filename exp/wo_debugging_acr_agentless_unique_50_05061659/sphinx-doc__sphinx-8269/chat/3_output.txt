To resolve the issue, I need to identify where the `linkcheck` command executes the logic for handling HTTP errors and anchor checks.

First, I need to look into the implementation of the `linkcheck` functionality within the Sphinx project, specifically where the anchors are checked and where error codes are handled. I will search for relevant methods or classes related to the link checking process.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("linkcheck_anchors")
search_method_in_codebase("make_linkcheck")
search_class_in_codebase("LinkCheckBuilder")
search_code_in_codebase("Anchor 'test' not found")
```

I will start by searching the source code for these components. This will give me insight into how link checking operates and where the conditional logic for distinguishing between anchor issues and HTTP errors can be implemented or modified.

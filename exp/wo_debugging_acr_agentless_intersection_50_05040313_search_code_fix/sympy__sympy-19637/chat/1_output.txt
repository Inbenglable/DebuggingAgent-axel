To resolve the issue, I need to check the implementation of the `kernS` method in the SymPy codebase, as this is where the reference to `kern` is causing an error. Since I don't have information about the specific file path where `kernS` is located, I'll need to search the entire codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("kernS")
```

To properly address the issue, I need to check the handling of the `__all__` attribute in the context of the `autodoc` module in Sphinx. The method `get_object_members` seems to be related to member extraction and might need modifications to appropriately respect an empty `__all__`.

Therefore, I'll retrieve the complete source code for `get_object_members` from `sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py` to analyze and potentially modify it to respect an empty `__all__`.

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py", "get_object_members")
```

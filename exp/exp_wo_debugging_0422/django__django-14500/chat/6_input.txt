#### ISSUE
Squashed migration is not marked as unapplied
Description
	 
		(last modified by Markus Holtermann)
	 
When unapplying a squashed migration and the replaced migration files are still around, the MigrationExecutor mark the squash migration as unapplied, too, not only the replaced migrations.

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To address the issue with the squashed migration not being marked as unapplied properly, we need to look into the Django MigrationExecutor behavior when handling squashed migrations and their related data. 

I need to locate and understand the logic within the `MigrationExecutor` that handles marking migrations as applied/unapplied. Specifically, I'll be looking for methods that manage migrations' states, possibly including applying or unapplying logic.

Let's start by searching for the `MigrationExecutor` class in the Django codebase, as it likely contains the logic we need to modify.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("MigrationExecutor")
```

Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_class_in_codebase("MigrationExecutor")

class MigrationExecutor:
    """
    End-to-end migration execution - load migrations and run them up or down
    to a specified set of targets.
    """

        ...

    def migration_plan(self, targets, clean_start=False):
        ...

    def _create_project_state(self, with_applied_migrations=False):
        ...

    def migrate(self, targets, plan=None, state=None, fake=False, fake_initial=False):
        ...

    def _migrate_all_forwards(self, state, plan, full_plan, fake, fake_initial):
        ...

        ...

    def record_migration(self, migration):
        ...

    def unapply_migration(self, state, migration, fake=False):
        ...

    def check_replacements(self):
        ...

    def detect_soft_applied(self, project_state, migration):
        ...
```


==================================================

Your Output:
To address the issue, I need to examine the logic behind the `unapply_migration` method in the `MigrationExecutor` class, as it is likely responsible for marking squashed migrations and their replacements as unapplied. Let's retrieve the source code for this method to understand and resolve the issue. 

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/executor.py", "MigrationExecutor.unapply_migration")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/executor.py", "MigrationExecutor.unapply_migration")
RESULT:
#### django/db/migrations/executor.py:MigrationExecutor.unapply_migration
```python
    def unapply_migration(self, state, migration, fake=False):
        """Run a migration backwards."""
        if self.progress_callback:
            self.progress_callback("unapply_start", migration, fake)
        if not fake:
            with self.connection.schema_editor(atomic=migration.atomic) as schema_editor:
                state = migration.unapply(state, schema_editor)
        # For replacement migrations, record individual statuses
        if migration.replaces:
            for app_label, name in migration.replaces:
                self.recorder.record_unapplied(app_label, name)
        else:
            self.recorder.record_unapplied(migration.app_label, migration.name)
        # Report progress
        if self.progress_callback:
            self.progress_callback("unapply_success", migration, fake)
        return state

```


==================================================

Your Output:
To resolve the issue, I need to ensure that when a squashed migration is unapplied, the squashed migration itself, rather than the individual migrations it replaces, is marked as unapplied. I have analyzed the `unapply_migration` method; it already makes conditional checks using the `migration.replaces` attribute to decide whether to mark the replacements or the migration itself as unapplied.

Thus, I need to further investigate how `migration.replaces` is being utilized elsewhere in the code, particularly how migrations are identified and marked as applied/unapplied when a squashed migration is involved.

To make sure I have all the necessary information, I will retrieve details on how migration recording is handled by investigating the `recorder` attribute or object, especially its methods like `record_unapplied` and potentially others involved in marking migrations as unapplied/applied.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/recorder.py", "Recorder.record_unapplied")
search_class_in_file("django/db/migrations/recorder.py", "Recorder")
```

==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/recorder.py", "Recorder.record_unapplied")
RESULT:
#### django/db/migrations/recorder.py:MigrationRecorder.record_unapplied
```python
    def record_unapplied(self, app, name):
        """Record that a migration was unapplied."""
        self.ensure_schema()
        self.migration_qs.filter(app=app, name=name).delete()

```


==================================================

Your Output:
Based on the code retrieved so far, the primary issue appears to be within the `MigrationExecutor.unapply_migration` method which already checks for `migration.replaces` to determine whether to mark the replacements or the migration itself as unapplied. However, the logic may need to be adjusted if squashed migrations are not being correctly identified when unapplied.

I need to ensure that squashed migrations and their replacements are being handled correctly when `migration.replaces` is involved, noting the role of the `recorder.record_unapplied` method. Since this method deletes the applied state of migrations from the database, it makes me suspect that the issue arises due to wrong entries being passed or not enough entries being processed here.

I'll need to further analyze how `migration.replaces` is being set or processed when squashed migrations are the subject, which may involve looking into the setup or creation of squashed migrations.

I will use the next step to retrieve the definition of `MigrationExecutor.check_replacements` since "check_replacements" might provide more clarity around squashed migrations treatment and its relation to recording what has been unapplied.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/executor.py", "MigrationExecutor.check_replacements")
```

==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/executor.py", "MigrationExecutor.check_replacements")
RESULT:
#### django/db/migrations/executor.py:MigrationExecutor.check_replacements
```python
    def check_replacements(self):
        """
        Mark replacement migrations applied if their replaced set all are.

        Do this unconditionally on every migrate, rather than just when
        migrations are applied or unapplied, to correctly handle the case
        when a new squash migration is pushed to a deployment that already had
        all its replaced migrations applied. In this case no new migration will
        be applied, but the applied state of the squashed migration must be
        maintained.
        """
        applied = self.recorder.applied_migrations()
        for key, migration in self.loader.replacements.items():
            all_applied = all(m in applied for m in migration.replaces)
            if all_applied and key not in applied:
                self.recorder.record_applied(*key)

```


==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

### IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

### IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

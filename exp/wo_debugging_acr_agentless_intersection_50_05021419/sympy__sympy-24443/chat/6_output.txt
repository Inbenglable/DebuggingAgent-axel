To address the issue stated, the `_check_homomorphism` method is the critical component, especially its inner `_image` function, when handling the `PermutationGroup`. I have obtained the code for `_check_homomorphism` already and this appears to be sufficient, as the `_image` function logic resides within it.

Ready generation: `True`

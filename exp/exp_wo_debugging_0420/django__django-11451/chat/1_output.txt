To resolve the issue, I need to locate and review the `ModelBackend.authenticate` method source code in order to apply the suggested patch. Since the issue relates to the `authenticate` method of the `ModelBackend` class within Django, I need to search for this method in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("ModelBackend.authenticate")
```

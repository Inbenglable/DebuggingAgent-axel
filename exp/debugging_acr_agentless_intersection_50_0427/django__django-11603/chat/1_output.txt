The traceback reveals that the test script is running into an error because the Django application is not fully initialized when attempting to define the `TestModel`. This results in the `AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet` exception when `apps.get_containing_app_config(module)` is called.

The problem arises because the Django environment hasn't been fully set up before the model is defined or used. Specifically, models cannot be defined outside a Django application context without ensuring the apps and models are loaded. This is indicated by the error occurring in the `__new__` method of `ModelBase`, which is part of the model creation process.

Before tracing into the method, the initial step to resolve this would be ensuring that Django's initialization code is appropriately executed. This often means running `django.setup()` before executing any code that relies on Django being fully started.

The observed error is happening during the attempt to configure and initialize Django incorrectly, which means it'd be helpful to trace the execution inside the Django framework where the model setup is expecting apps to be ready. For this, we need to examine the method responsible for checking app readiness.

Observed method: `django/apps/registry.py:Apps.check_apps_ready`

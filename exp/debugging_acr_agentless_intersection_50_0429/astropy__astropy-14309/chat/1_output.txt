Analyzing the error and traceback information, the issue seems to originate from `is_fits` method in the `connect.py` file, specifically at line 72. The error arises when `args[0]` is accessed, and it appears there are no elements in `args`, leading to the `IndexError`. The traceback outlines the call stack, showing that the issue propagates back through the `identify_format` method in the `io/registry/base.py` file.

Given this context, the abnormal behavior occurs when accessing `args[0]`:
```python
return isinstance(args[0], (HDUList, TableHDU, BinTableHDU, GroupsHDU))
```
This suggests that `args` might be empty in some cases, which is not being handled appropriately.

Let's begin by observing the `is_fits` method in the `connect.py` file where the error is occurring:

Observed method: `astropy/io/fits/connect.py:is_fits`

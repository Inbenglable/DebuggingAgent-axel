Based on the search results, I've found information about the `CaptureFixture` and `FDCapture` classes, but not about the internal workings of `FDCapture.readouterr`. This method seems to be crucial to understanding where the `\r` is being converted to `\n`. Therefore, I need to locate where `FDCapture` internally reads and processes captured content.

I will now search for methods in the `FDCapture` class to identify the specifics of this conversion.

```python
search_method_in_file("src/_pytest/capture.py", "FDCapture.snap")
```

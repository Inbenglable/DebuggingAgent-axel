### Analysis of Current Observed Code and Abnormal Behavior

The `_ArgumentsManager.__init__` method is the initializer for the configuration related to argument parsing within Pylint. It sets up several dictionary attributes, including `_option_dicts`, which likely holds `optdict` configurations for various command-line options.

### Key Points:
- **Attribute Initialization**:
  - `_option_dicts` is initialized as a dictionary intended to store option configurations. This is where `optdict` is likely managed or assigned values for different options.
  - `_arg_parser` is created as an `ArgumentParser` object, central to argument parsing.

- **Potential Configuration Point**: `_option_dicts` and `_arg_parser` represent elements crucial in argument management. The issue can originate from misconfigured settings in these attributes.

### Observed Problem:
The current analysis focuses on encoding and initializing the necessary structures for argument parsing. The misbehavior of `-v` likely originates from incorrect configuration within `_option_dicts`, specifically the attributes determining actions for verbose options.

### Next Steps:
To continue locating the buggy setup causing `-v` to expect an argument, further investigation into how `_option_dicts` is populated, especially with respect to the verbose option, is required. Configuration of these dictionaries likely provides the root cause.

Thus, I will proceed to explore how `_option_dicts` gets populated or initialized, specifically focusing on attributes related to verbose.

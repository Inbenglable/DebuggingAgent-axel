The search method in the codebase returned several `_latex` methods associated with different classes in the Sympy library. To address the issue, my focus needs to be specifically on the `Subs` class implementation or any associated LaTeX printing methods (likely named `_latex` or similarly) directly related to the `Subs` class.

Here's an evaluation of each `name`:  

- **sympy/physics/secondquant.py:PermutationOperator._latex** - Irrelevant as it pertains to `PermutationOperator`.
  
- **sympy/physics/vector/vector.py:Vector._latex** - Irrelevant as it pertains to `Vector`.

- **sympy/physics/vector/dyadic.py:Dyadic._latex** - Irrelevant as it pertains to `Dyadic`.

- **sympy/physics/quantum/tensorproduct.py:TensorProduct._latex** - Irrelevant as it pertains to `TensorProduct`.

- **sympy/physics/quantum/state.py:StateBase._latex** - Irrelevant as it pertains to `StateBase`.

- **sympy/physics/quantum/qexpr.py:QExpr._latex** - Irrelevant as it pertains to `QExpr`.

- **sympy/physics/quantum/innerproduct.py:InnerProduct._latex** - Irrelevant as it pertains to `InnerProduct`.

- **sympy/physics/quantum/cg.py:Wigner9j._latex** - Irrelevant as it pertains to `Wigner9j`.

- **sympy/physics/quantum/anticommutator.py:AntiCommutator._latex** - Irrelevant as it pertains to `AntiCommutator`.

- **sympy/physics/quantum/gate.py:CNotGate._latex** - Irrelevant as it pertains to `CNotGate`.

- **sympy/physics/quantum/hilbert.py:TensorPowerHilbertSpace._latex** - Irrelevant as it pertains to `TensorPowerHilbertSpace`.

- **sympy/physics/quantum/operator.py:OuterProduct._latex** - Irrelevant as it pertains to `OuterProduct`.

- **sympy/physics/quantum/spin.py:WignerD._latex** - Irrelevant as it pertains to `WignerD`.

- **sympy/physics/quantum/commutator.py:Commutator._latex** - Irrelevant as it pertains to `Commutator`.

- **sympy/physics/quantum/constants.py:HBar._latex** - Irrelevant as it pertains to `HBar`.

- **sympy/physics/units/quantities.py:Quantity._latex** - Irrelevant as it pertains to `Quantity`.

- **sympy/core/numbers.py:ImaginaryUnit._latex** - Irrelevant as it pertains to `ImaginaryUnit`.

- **sympy/diffgeom/diffgeom.py:CovarDerivativeOp._latex** - Irrelevant as it pertains to `CovarDerivativeOp`.

- **sympy/vector/scalar.py:BaseScalar._latex** - Irrelevant as it pertains to `BaseScalar`.

- **sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py:adjoint._latex** - Irrelevant as it pertains to `adjoint`.

- **sympy/printing/tableform.py:TableForm._latex** - Irrelevant as it pertains to `TableForm`.

- **sympy/sets/setexpr.py:SetExpr._latex** - Irrelevant as it pertains to `SetExpr`.

Since none of the results specifically mention the `Subs` class or its related methods for LaTeX handling, they are all irrelevant. Therefore, I cannot select any of the results as they neither address nor are connected to the LaTeX rendering issue with the `Subs` class. 

Consequently, there is no applicable selection for this case. Further investigation or different queries will be necessary to address the issue.

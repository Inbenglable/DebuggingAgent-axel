To resolve the issue with `URLValidator` in Django related to changes introduced by Python's bpo-43882, we need to consider how URLs are validated. Specifically, we should check if the `URLValidator` method is directly handling the stripping or validation of control characters such as LF, CR, and tabs.

First, we need to examine the `URLValidator` code to understand its current behavior and then discern where exactly we should apply the fix. Therefore, we need to retrieve the source code for `URLValidator`.

I'll begin by searching for the `URLValidator` in the Django codebase to inspect how it's being implemented.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("URLValidator")
```

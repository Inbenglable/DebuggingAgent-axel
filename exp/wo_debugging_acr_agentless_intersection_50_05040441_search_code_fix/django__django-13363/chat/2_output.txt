To address the issue, I need to retrieve the `as_sql` method implementation from both the `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` classes. This is where the timezone handling logic likely occurs, and we need to modify this to properly pass the `tzinfo` parameter.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncDate.as_sql")
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncTime.as_sql")
```

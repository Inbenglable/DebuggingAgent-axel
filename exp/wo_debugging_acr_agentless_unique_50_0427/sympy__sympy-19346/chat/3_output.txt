I need to retrieve the implementation of the `ReprPrinter` class methods related to handling `dict` and `set` objects. This will allow me to identify how to properly extend or modify them to fix the issue.

Since the ReprPrinter class contains several `_print_*` methods for different types, I'll search for any specific methods that handle `dict` and `set`. If they don't exist, I'll evaluate the existing methods and see where to add the new functionality.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/repr.py", "_print_dict")
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/repr.py", "_print_set")
search_class_in_file("sympy/printing/repr.py", "ReprPrinter")
```

Based on the runtime information and observations, the hist method seen is not related to the core functionality of the `plt.hist` command and does not address the histogram calculation, which is crucial for identifying why `range` doesn't apply correctly when `density=True`.

To address the bug, we need to inspect the logic within `Axes.hist()` that computes the bins, especially under the conditions that involve the `density` parameter.

Let's continue tracing by selecting the method where the histogram and bin interactions occur.

Observed method: `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py:Axes.hist`

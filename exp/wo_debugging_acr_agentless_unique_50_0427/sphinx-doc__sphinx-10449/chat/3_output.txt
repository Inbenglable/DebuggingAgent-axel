Before generating a patch, I need to retrieve the source code for the method `format_signature` within the `ClassDocumenter` class in the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file. This method is likely responsible for formatting the class signature and including the class "return type" when it shouldn't.

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py", "ClassDocumenter.format_signature")
```

To resolve the issue with the `trim_docstring` function, I need to gather the source code of that method to understand its implementation and make the required modifications. I will start by searching for the `trim_docstring` method in the codebase since the file path is not provided.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("trim_docstring")
```

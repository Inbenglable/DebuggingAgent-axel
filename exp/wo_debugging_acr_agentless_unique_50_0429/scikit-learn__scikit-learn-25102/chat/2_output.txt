To generate the patch, we need to modify the `_SetOutputMixin` and `_wrap_in_pandas_container` methods to allow preservation of dtypes as described in the proposed solution. We need to see the full implementation of both `_SetOutputMixin` and `_wrap_in_pandas_container` to work with them directly.

We have already retrieved these methods from the file. Therefore, I have enough information to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

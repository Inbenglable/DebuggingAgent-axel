Based on the information provided, the issue arises from the fact that the `json_script` template tag is not recognized because it is not registered as a template tag in the Django template system. This registration is typically required for custom tags to be recognized and used within Django templates.

### Observed Behavior:
- The test specifically is looking for the `json_script` tag to be registered, but it encounters a `TemplateSyntaxError` due to its absence from the registered libraries.
- This results in a key error and consequently a `TemplateSyntaxError`, indicating that the tag specified for loading doesn't exist in the registered libraries.

### Analysis:
1. **Registration of Template Tags:** The `Library` class is responsible for registering both tags and filters. The `tag_function` method adds functions to the `tags` dictionary, enabling them to be used as template tags.
2. **Missing Registration:** It seems that `json_script` needs to be correctly defined and registered, presumably in a Django appâ€™s `templatetags` package. However, based on the trace, it does not appear in any registered library, which suggests it might be missing entirely or erroneously registered as a filter.

### Conclusion:
The root of the issue is likely in the lack of registration of the `json_script` tag within the tag system, hence causing the attempt to load it to fail. The `json_script` should be explicitly registered by defining it inside a `templatetags` module and using an instance of the `Library` class to register the tag.

### Next Steps:
To verify and locate the missing or incorrect registration of `json_script`, we should check the typical locations within the Django `templatetags` files where such additions are usually made. This will involve examining where `json_script` is potentially defined and should be added into the tag registry.

**Action:**
I will now further observe the relevant scope where `tag_function` or similar functions are usually employed to understand the registration process and why `json_script` is not recognized.

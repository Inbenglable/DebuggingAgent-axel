To make `Dagger` work seamlessly with `IdentityOperator`, I need to understand how the multiplication logic is implemented for `Dagger` objects, as its behavior wasn't explicitly demonstrated in the `Dagger` class definition retrieved earlier. I suspect that the multiplication might be defined elsewhere, potentially as an operator overload method.

I should search for methods related to multiplication in the `Dagger` class to understand how it interacts with the `IdentityOperator`. Specifically, I'll look for such method definitions or logic in the `sympy/physics/quantum/dagger.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/physics/quantum/dagger.py", "__mul__")
```

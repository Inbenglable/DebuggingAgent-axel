I need to retrieve the source code for the `Paginator` class to implement the `__iter__` method within it. Given the issue description, it seems that the `Paginator` class already has the `page_range` method, which I'll be using in the `__iter__` method implementation. Therefore, I'll begin by searching for the `Paginator` class in the Django codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Paginator")
```

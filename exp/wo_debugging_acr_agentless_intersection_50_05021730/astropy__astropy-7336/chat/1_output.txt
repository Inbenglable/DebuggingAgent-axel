To address the issue, I will need to examine the implementation of the `quantity_input` decorator to understand how it processes type hints, especially for methods with a `None` return annotation. This will allow me to identify where the checks should be added to handle the `None` return type appropriately. Here are the steps:

1. Locate the `quantity_input` implementation to see how it handles return types.
2. Find any relevant utility functions or decorators used within `quantity_input` that might be responsible for processing type hints and returns.

I'll start by searching for the `quantity_input` method in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("quantity_input")
```

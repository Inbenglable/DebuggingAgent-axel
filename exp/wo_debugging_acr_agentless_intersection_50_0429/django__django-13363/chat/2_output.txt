To address the issue, I need to retrieve the source code for the `as_sql` methods within the `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` classes to understand how they handle timezone information. Currently, the `as_sql` method uses `get_current_timezone_name()` unconditionally, and I need to confirm whether this method requires modifications to accept `tzinfo`.

Let's retrieve the `as_sql` method definitions for both classes.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncDate.as_sql")
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncTime.as_sql")
```

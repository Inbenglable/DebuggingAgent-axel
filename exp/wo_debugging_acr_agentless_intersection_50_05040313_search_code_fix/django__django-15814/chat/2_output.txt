Based on the information gathered, the solution involves modifying how Django retrieves metadata for models by accessing the concrete model's metadata. I need to update the `Query` class method where the `opts = cur_model._meta` line is located, around line 748 in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`.

Now, to generate the patch, I need the source code of the `Query` class in the `django/db/models/sql/query.py` file to apply the necessary changes.

I'll proceed to retrieve the source code for this class.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/sql/query.py", "Query")
```

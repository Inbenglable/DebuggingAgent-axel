To address the issue with the `Contains.as_set` method, I need to retrieve its source code. This will allow me to understand its current implementation and make necessary modifications. Since the method most likely belongs to the `Contains` class, I need to search for the `Contains` class and its `as_set` method in the codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Contains")
search_method_in_codebase("Contains.as_set")
```

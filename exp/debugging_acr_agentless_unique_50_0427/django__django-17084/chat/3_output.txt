The error message indicates that the import statement for `Window` is failing because `Window` is not found in the `django.db.models.functions` module. This is evidenced by the error:

```
ImportError: cannot import name 'Window' from 'django.db.models.functions'
```

Upon further inspection, `Window` is actually part of the `django.db.models` module, not `django.db.models.functions`. The import statement should be corrected accordingly.

The buggy import statement is thus located in the main script that's attempting to reproduce the issue. This can be inferred from the following script line:

```python
from django.db.models.functions import Coalesce, Window
```

This line is incorrect because `Window` should be imported from `django.db.models`, not `django.db.models.functions`.

Buggy method: `reproduce.py:<module>`

Now You need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Query.resolve_lookup_value coerces value of type list to tuple
Description
	
Changes introduced in #30687 cause an input value list to be coerced to tuple breaking exact value queries. This affects ORM field types that are dependent on matching input types such as PickledField.
The expected iterable return type should match input iterable type.

</ISSUE>


You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue, I need to investigate the `Query.resolve_lookup_value` method to understand how it handles input types. This will help me modify it to ensure that the expected return type matches the input iterable type without coercing lists into tuples. 

First, I need to locate and retrieve the source code for the `Query.resolve_lookup_value` method within the Django project. Since I don't have its file path, I will search for the method in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("Query.resolve_lookup_value")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("Query.resolve_lookup_value")
RESULT:
#### django/db/models/sql/query.py:Query.resolve_lookup_value
```python
    def resolve_lookup_value(self, value, can_reuse, allow_joins, simple_col):
        if hasattr(value, 'resolve_expression'):
            kwargs = {'reuse': can_reuse, 'allow_joins': allow_joins}
            if isinstance(value, F):
                kwargs['simple_col'] = simple_col
            value = value.resolve_expression(self, **kwargs)
        elif isinstance(value, (list, tuple)):
            # The items of the iterable may be expressions and therefore need
            # to be resolved independently.
            resolved_values = []
            for sub_value in value:
                if hasattr(sub_value, 'resolve_expression'):
                    if isinstance(sub_value, F):
                        resolved_values.append(sub_value.resolve_expression(
                            self, reuse=can_reuse, allow_joins=allow_joins,
                            simple_col=simple_col,
                        ))
                    else:
                        resolved_values.append(sub_value.resolve_expression(
                            self, reuse=can_reuse, allow_joins=allow_joins,
                        ))
                else:
                    resolved_values.append(sub_value)
            value = tuple(resolved_values)
        return value

```


==================================================

Your Output:
The provided source code for the `resolve_lookup_value` method demonstrates that the method currently coerces both lists and tuples into tuples. To fix the issue where lists should not be coerced into tuples and instead keep their original type, I need to modify the code to maintain the original input type (list or tuple).

I have enough information to generate the patch since the issue is isolated within the `resolve_lookup_value` method, and the required functionality is clear.

Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

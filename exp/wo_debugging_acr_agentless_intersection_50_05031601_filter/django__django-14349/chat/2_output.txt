To address the issue, I need to inspect the `__call__` method of the `URLValidator` class to determine how the URL validation is being executed. Currently, I've only seen the class declaration but not the method itself. This inspection will allow me to identify where validation should be adjusted concerning newline (`\n`), carriage return (`\r`), and tab (`\t`) characters.

Let's retrieve the source code for the `__call__` method in the `URLValidator` class, located in `django/core/validators.py`.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/validators.py", "URLValidator.__call__")
```

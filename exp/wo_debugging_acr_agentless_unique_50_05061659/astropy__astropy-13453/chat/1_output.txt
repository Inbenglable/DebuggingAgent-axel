To address the issue, I need to inspect the source code for the `write` method in the context of HTML output handling within the **astropy** project. This will allow me to understand how the method is implemented and why the `formats` argument is not applied for the HTML output format.

Before I can generate the patch, I need to search for the `write` method in the codebase. Since the `write` method likely belongs to the ASCII submodule of **astropy**, I will specify that in the search.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("ascii.write")
```

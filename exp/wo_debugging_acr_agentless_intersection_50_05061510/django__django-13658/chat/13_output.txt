The patch modifies the instantiation of `CommandParser` in the `ManagementUtility` class to use `self.prog_name` instead of relying on `sys.argv[0]`. The intention is to avoid the error when `sys.argv[0]` is `None`.

Before the patch, the error output shows that a `TypeError` occurs because `sys.argv[0]` is `None`, leading to a failure in `os.path.basename`, which expects a string or path-like object.

Reviewing the patched output, it remains identical to the original output, indicating that the `TypeError` still occurs when `sys.argv[0]` is `None`. The error persists, and the test raises the same `AssertionError`, indicating that `prog_name` is not correctly set in `CommandParser`.

The persistent error suggests that the patch did not resolve the original issue, as the `TypeError` still occurs at the same point.

Therefore, the issue is not fixed.

Issue resolved: `False`

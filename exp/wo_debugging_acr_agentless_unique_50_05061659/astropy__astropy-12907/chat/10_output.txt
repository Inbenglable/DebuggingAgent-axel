Let's review the patch and the test outputs:

### Patch Review
The patch modifies the function `_separable` in the file `astropy/modeling/separable.py`. Specifically, it changes how the `&` operator is handled when combining separability matrices. The proposed change uses `np.block` to create block diagonal matrices, which means that when models are nested or combined using `&`, the separability matrices are correctly updated to reflect their independent nature.

### Original vs Patched Output
- **Original Output**: 
  The test failed with an AssertionError indicating that the actual separability matrix did not match the expected matrix.

- **Patched Output**: 
  After applying the patch, the test runs successfully, confirming via the message "The issue is fixed. Exiting with code 0." This indicates that the actual separability matrix matches the expected matrix, thus resolving the issue described.

Based on the patch review and the successful test output after applying the patch, the issue appears to be resolved.

Issue resolved: `True`

To address the issue with the handling of dimensionless expressions in the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method, I've already obtained the necessary source code for this method. It is evident that the method's current logic needs an improvement to properly handle dimensionless results for special functions like `exp` when the input is dimensionless.

Given that the required code segment has been sourced and I have enough information to proceed with generating the patch, I will now proceed with the patch generation.

Ready generation: `True`

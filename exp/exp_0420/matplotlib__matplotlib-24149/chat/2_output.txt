The issue occurs when the `ax.bar` method is called with inputs containing only `NaN` values. The error message suggests that the `StopIteration` exception is raised within the method `_convert_dx` of the `Axes` class in `matplotlib/axes/_axes.py`.

Hereâ€™s the last line from the traceback:

```python
File ~/miniconda/envs/py310/lib/python3.10/site-packages/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py:1749, in _safe_first_finite
```

The likely method to observe next is `_safe_first_finite` because this is where the `StopIteration` is occurring.

Observed method: `lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py:_safe_first_finite`

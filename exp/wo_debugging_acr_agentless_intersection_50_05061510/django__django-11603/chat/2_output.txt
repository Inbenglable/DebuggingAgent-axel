To address the issue of adding DISTINCT support for the Avg, Sum, Min, and Max aggregates, I need to examine the source code of these classes to understand how they currently function and potentially make modifications to allow DISTINCT functionality. As I already know the file where these classes are located, I will retrieve the entire class code for each of these aggregates to prepare for making the necessary changes.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Avg")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Sum")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Min")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Max")
```

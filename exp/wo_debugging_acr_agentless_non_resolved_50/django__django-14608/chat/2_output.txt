To resolve the issue of adding a `nonform` CSS class for non-form errors in FormSets, we need to modify the `non_form_errors` method in the `BaseFormSet` class located in `django/forms/formsets.py`. I will proceed to retrieve the source code for the `non_form_errors` method to implement the necessary changes.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/forms/formsets.py", "BaseFormSet.non_form_errors")
```

Based on the observed scope in the `requests/sessions.py:Session.request`, the code snippet is responsible for preparing the request using `self.prepare_request(req)` and subsequently sending it using `self.send(prep, **send_kwargs)`. Given that the `UnicodeDecodeError` typically occurs during the composition of the HTTP message, it suggests something may be going wrong right after the request is prepared and before it is sent.

The call to `self.prepare_request(req)` prepares the HTTP request, which is where encoding issues might first become problematic. Since the issue at hand involves the request method being a Unicode string, the encoding problem might manifest during the preparation of the request with the given `method`.

To dive deeper into this problem, we need to observe the `prepare_request` method within the `requests.sessions` module as this method likely handles the creation of the request object, where incorrect handling of Unicode could occur.

Letâ€™s proceed by tracing the `prepare_request` method within the `Session` class.

Observed method: `requests/sessions.py:Session.prepare_request`

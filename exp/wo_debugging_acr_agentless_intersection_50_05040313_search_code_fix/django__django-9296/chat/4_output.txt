To generate the patch for adding the `__iter__` method to the `Paginator` class, it's necessary to review the full implementation of the `Paginator` class to make sure that the new method can be integrated without affecting the existing functionality. I need to search specifically for the full implementation of the `Paginator` class, as part of it was already retrieved. Let's proceed to retrieve the full source code of the `Paginator` class from `django/core/paginator.py`.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/core/paginator.py", "Paginator")
```

Based on the information retrieved, the `__hash__` method of the `Field` class is indeed causing the `hash` value to change upon assignment to a model class because it's incorporating the `model._meta.app_label` and `model._meta.model_name` into the hash computation, which changes when the model is assigned.

Given the description in the issue, we aim to revert the `__hash__` method to what it was before the changes introduced in #31750. This means returning a hash value that relies only on the creation counter, as it should be immutable regardless of the assignment state of the field.

Since we've retrieved the current implementation of the `Field` class and its `__hash__` method, we are ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

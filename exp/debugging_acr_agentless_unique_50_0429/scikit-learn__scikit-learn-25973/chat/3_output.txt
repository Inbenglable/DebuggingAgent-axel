To address the cross-validation generator issue, we should investigate how the `cv` parameter is used within `SequentialFeatureSelector`, specifically the `fit` method, which has been observed. The error implicates the `_get_best_new_feature_score` method, which seems to be where the `cross_val_score` is called, and it's likely that `cross_validate` is being invoked.

The initial analysis suggests the generator might be exhausted or improperly handled before the cross-validation. Therefore, we'll need to observe the method where `cross_val_score` is called to ensure it's handled correctly.

Observed method: `sklearn/feature_selection/_sequential.py:SequentialFeatureSelector._get_best_new_feature_score`

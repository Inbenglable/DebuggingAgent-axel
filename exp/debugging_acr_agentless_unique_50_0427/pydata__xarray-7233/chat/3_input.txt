You need to trace the abnormal program to resolve project issues and submit pull requests.
Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **xarray** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
ds.Coarsen.construct demotes non-dimensional coordinates to variables
### What happened?

`ds.Coarsen.construct` demotes non-dimensional coordinates to variables

### What did you expect to happen?

All variables that were coordinates before the coarsen.construct stay as coordinates afterwards.

### Minimal Complete Verifiable Example

```Python
In [3]: da = xr.DataArray(np.arange(24), dims=["time"])
   ...: da = da.assign_coords(day=365 * da)
   ...: ds = da.to_dataset(name="T")

In [4]: ds
Out[4]: 
<xarray.Dataset>
Dimensions:  (time: 24)
Coordinates:
    day      (time) int64 0 365 730 1095 1460 1825 ... 6935 7300 7665 8030 8395
Dimensions without coordinates: time
Data variables:
    T        (time) int64 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ... 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23

In [5]: ds.coarsen(time=12).construct(time=("year", "month"))
Out[5]: 
<xarray.Dataset>
Dimensions:  (year: 2, month: 12)
Coordinates:
    day      (year, month) int64 0 365 730 1095 1460 ... 7300 7665 8030 8395
Dimensions without coordinates: year, month
Data variables:
    T        (year, month) int64 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ... 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23
```

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        da = xr.DataArray(np.arange(24), dims=["time"])
        da = da.assign_coords(day=365 * da)
        ds = da.to_dataset(name="T")

        result = ds.coarsen(time=12).construct(time=("year", "month"))

        # Check if 'day' is still a coordinate
        if 'day' not in result.coords:
            raise AssertionError("The 'day' coordinate was demoted to a variable instead of remaining a coordinate.")

        print("The issue is fixed.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("An unexpected error occurred.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()


This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
Based on the output, we can see the following observations:

1. The original `DataArray` named `da` has a coordinate called `'day'`, which is set by the `assign_coords` method.
2. The problem arises after executing `ds.coarsen(time=12).construct(time=("year", "month"))`. The `'day'` coordinate is converted (or "demoted") into a variable, hence it does not appear in `result.coords` which is expected in the AssertionError.
3. The execution trace indicates that the issue might stem from the processing in the `rolling.py` file, specifically within the `Coarsen.construct` method. While iterating over the `obj.variables` items, it should ensure that originally designated coordinates are also treated as coordinates in the resulting Dataset, but it places the `day` as a variable instead.

Based on the observations, the next step is to identify why the coordinate is not preserved. The method `Coarsen.construct` seems relevant as it deals with constructing the coarsened dataset.

Observed method: `xarray/core/rolling.py:Coarsen.construct`
==================================================
Based on the code for the `Coarsen.construct` method, let's analyze the important sections to identify where the issue could arise:

1. **Setting Coordinates**: The issue is about non-dimensional coordinates being demoted to variables. In the `construct` method, coordinates are being set in line 977:
   ```python
   should_be_coords = set(window_dim) & set(self.obj.coords)
   result = reshaped.set_coords(should_be_coords)
   ```

   This code selects only those coordinates that are also part of the `window_dim`. However, the `day` coordinate is not a dimension, and thus likely gets excluded from the `should_be_coords` set. As a result, it is not being maintained as a coordinate in the `result`.

2. **Reshaping Process**: The loop through `obj.variables.items()` from lines 964 to 974 reshapes each variable. However, it doesn't seem to make any special checks for non-dimensional coordinates initially set in `ds` before coarsening.

The key area to focus on is the process where coordinates are set after reshaping the dataset because the preservation of the `day` coordinate is not handled, leading to the demotion of `day` from a coordinate to a variable.

To pinpoint the root cause, let's observe deeper into the method:

Observed scope: `xarray/core/rolling.py:964-977`

This will help further elucidate whether the issue lies in how variables and coordinates are handled during reshaping, and why non-dimensional coordinates are demoted.
==================================================


Now you choose Coarsen.construct's code snippet 
   964	        for key, var in obj.variables.items():
   965	            reshaped_dims = tuple(
   966	                itertools.chain(*[window_dim.get(dim, [dim]) for dim in list(var.dims)])
   967	            )
   968	            if reshaped_dims != var.dims:
   969	                windows = {w: self.windows[w] for w in window_dim if w in var.dims}
   970	                reshaped_var, _ = var.coarsen_reshape(windows, self.boundary, self.side)
   971	                attrs = var.attrs if keep_attrs else {}
   972	                reshaped[key] = (reshaped_dims, reshaped_var, attrs)
   973	            else:
   974	                reshaped[key] = var
   975	
   976	        should_be_coords = set(window_dim) & set(self.obj.coords)
   977	        result = reshaped.set_coords(should_be_coords)

You need to trace the abnormal program behavior step by step to identify the root cause of the bug and locate the buggy method that contains the code to be fixed.
Now, please first analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior. 

Then, if you can already locate the buggy method and buggy code, reply with:  
Buggy method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Otherwise, continue tracing by selecting the next method to observe. Reply with: 
Observed method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Note that {FILE_PATH} refers to the path relative to the repository. And if you want to observe a method inside a class, please specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME.

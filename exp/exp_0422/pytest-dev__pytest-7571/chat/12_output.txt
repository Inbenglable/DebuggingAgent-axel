Based on the retrieved information, we have the full context of how the `LogCaptureFixture` class is structured, especially focusing on the `_finalize` method which is responsible for restoring log levels. The existing `_finalize` method iterates over `_initial_logger_levels` to reset logger levels, which seems appropriate for restoring settings. I suspect the issue might actually lie not in this method but in the setup phase, where `self._initial_logger_levels` might not be properly populated due to changed implementations in Pytest 6.0.

To generate a patch, we need to ensure that the `_finalize` function is correctly triggered at each test teardown phase, restoring the initial log level, which could involve tweaks in how initial levels are recorded or ensuring the lifecycle of the fixture appropriately manages log levels.

Given the information at hand, I'm ready to generate the patch that would address the issue where `_initial_logger_levels` might be missing initialization or effective population for logger levels during tests, ensuring the restoration logic is thoroughly tested within the pytest lifecycle.

Ready generation: `True`

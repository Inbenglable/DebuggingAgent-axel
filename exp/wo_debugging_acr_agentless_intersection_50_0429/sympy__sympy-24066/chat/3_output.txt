The source code for the `UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension()` method has been retrieved. The issue arises when the code processes exponentials where the exponent is dimensionless, but this is not properly handled, resulting in incorrect dimension calculations.

After reviewing the existing code, an adjustment needs to be made in the `Function` handling part of the method. We need to ensure that when functions like `exp()` are processed, the argument passed to them is checked explicitly for dimensionlessness and recalculated accordingly to have a dimension of 1.

Here is the plan to resolve the issue:
- Modify the part of the implementation dealing with `expr` being of type `Function`.
- Check each argument of the function to ensure if its dimension is dimensionless and enforce dimension 1 where applicable.

I am ready to make these adjustments, so no further source code retrieval is necessary.

Ready generation: `True`

The test output before and after applying the patch is identical. Both demonstrate that the order of gamma matrices is incorrectly flipped, as evidenced by the second test case output:

```
4*GammaMatrix(sigma)*GammaMatrix(rho)
```

This indicates that the patch did not resolve the issue, since the expected outcome should have matched the order specified in the assertion:

```
4*GammaMatrix(rho)*GammaMatrix(sigma)
```

The changes proposed in the patch, which attempt to modify how `prepend_indices` accumulates the order of leading gamma matrices, do not achieve the intended fix of maintaining the proper order.

Given this analysis, the issue remains unresolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

To generate the patch, it would be beneficial to understand how the `_constraint_names` method operates, as it is essential in generating the list of constraints for the given fields. I need to review the source code for this method to understand any possible changes or how it interacts with the constraints in case of `index_together` and `unique_together`.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "_constraint_names")
```

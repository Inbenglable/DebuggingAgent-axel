To resolve the described issue, we'll simplify the `execute_sql_flush` method's signature by removing the `using` parameter and inferring it via `self.connection.alias`. Below is the search/replace edit to implement this change:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/backends/base/operations.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    def execute_sql_flush(self, using, sql_list):\n        \"\"\"Execute a list of SQL statements to flush the database.\"\"\"\n        with transaction.atomic(using=using, savepoint=self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl):\n            with self.connection.cursor() as cursor:\n                for sql in sql_list:\n                    cursor.execute(sql)\n=======\n    def execute_sql_flush(self, sql_list):\n        \"\"\"Execute a list of SQL statements to flush the database.\"\"\"\n        using = self.connection.alias\n        with transaction.atomic(using=using, savepoint=self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl):\n            with self.connection.cursor() as cursor:\n                for sql in sql_list:\n                    cursor.execute(sql)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This modification removes the `using` parameter from the function signature, and instead assigns `using` to `self.connection.alias` within the method, maintaining the functionality as required by the issue description.

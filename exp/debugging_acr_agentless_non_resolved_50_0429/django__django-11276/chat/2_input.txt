You need to trace the abnormal program to resolve project issues and submit pull requests.
Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Use Python stdlib html.escape() to in django.utils.html.escape()
Description
	
The function django.utils.html.escape() partially duplicates the Python stdlib function html.escape(). We can replace this duplication with wider community developed version.
html.escape() has been available since Python 3.2:
​https://docs.python.org/3/library/html.html#html.escape
This function is also faster than Django's. As Python bug ​https://bugs.python.org/issue18020 concludes, using .replace() can be faster than .translate(). This function gets called numerous times when rendering templates. After making the change locally, I saw the following improvement:
master:
$ python -m timeit -s 'from django.utils.html import escape' 'escape(copyright)'
50000 loops, best of 5: 4.03 usec per loop
branch:
$ python -m timeit -s 'from django.utils.html import escape' 'escape(copyright)'
100000 loops, best of 5: 2.45 usec per loop
One small concern, html.escape() converts ' to &#x27 rather than &#39. These values are functionally equivalent HTML, but I'll mention it as a backwards incompatible change as the literal text has changed

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
import sys
import traceback
from django.utils.html import escape as django_escape
from html import escape as stdlib_escape

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    test_string = "It's a test string with 'single quotes'."
    django_escaped = django_escape(test_string)
    stdlib_escaped = stdlib_escape(test_string, quote=True)

    try:
        assert django_escaped == stdlib_escaped, (
            f"django.utils.html.escape() output does not match html.escape() output. "
            f"django: {django_escaped}, stdlib: {stdlib_escaped}"
        )
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

    print("The issue is fixed.")
    sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()


This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
To determine the root cause of the discrepancy observed in the behavior of `django.utils.html.escape`, let's first understand the issue at hand. The testing script compares outputs from `django.utils.html.escape` and `html.escape` when applied to a test string with single quotes. The assertion failure indicates that the outputs differ only in the way single quotes are escaped. Specifically, `django.utils.html.escape` uses `&#39;` while `html.escape` uses `&#x27;`.

From the traceback, we can infer:
- The assertion fails in the `main` function because `django_escaped` and `stdlib_escaped` are not equal. 
- The `django_escape` function, imported from `django.utils.html`, uses `&#39;` for `'` instead of `&#x27;` used by `html.escape`.

Given this, the observed discrepancy is due to the internal implementation of `django.utils.html.escape`. Since our goal is to update `django.utils.html.escape` to utilize `html.escape`, the issue is likely in the `escape` method within `django.utils.html`.

To pinpoint the exact location of the buggy code, I will observe the `escape` function definition in `django.utils.html`.

Observed method: `django/utils/html.py:escape`
==================================================


Now you choose downstream method escape to further observe, tracing the abnormal program behavior.
This is the method code:
    37	def escape(text):
    38	    """
    39	    Return the given text with ampersands, quotes and angle brackets encoded
    40	    for use in HTML.
    41	
    42	    Always escape input, even if it's already escaped and marked as such.
    43	    This may result in double-escaping. If this is a concern, use
    44	    conditional_escape() instead.
    45	    """
    46	    return mark_safe(str(text).translate(_html_escapes))


This is the runtime information of escape:

You need to trace the abnormal program behavior step by step to identify the root cause of the bug and locate the buggy method that contains the code to be fixed.
Now, please first analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior. 

Then, if you can already locate the buggy method and buggy code, reply with:  
Buggy method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Otherwise, continue tracing by telling me the code line scope that you want to deeper observe, we will show you the deeper downstream run-time information of the scope you select. Please reply with:
Observed scope: `{FILE_PATH}:{START_LOC}-{END_LOC}`
Note that {FILE_PATH} refers to the path relative to the repository.

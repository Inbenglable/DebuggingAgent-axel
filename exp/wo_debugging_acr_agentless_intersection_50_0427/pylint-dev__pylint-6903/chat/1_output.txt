To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code in the `pylint/lint/run.py` file related to the `_query_cpu` function which contributes to the problem. This will allow me to understand the logic used for CPU calculation and ensure we do not return 0 as the number of jobs.

I will utilize the search API to retrieve the relevant source code snippets.

```python
search_method_in_file("pylint/lint/run.py", "_query_cpu")
search_code_in_file("pylint/lint/run.py", "cpu_count()")
```

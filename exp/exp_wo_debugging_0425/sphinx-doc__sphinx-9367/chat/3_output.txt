I'm ready to generate the patch based on the information gathered. 

From the information retrieved, there's an `unparse` function in `sphinx/pycode/ast.py` that appears to handle converting an AST node back into a string. This is likely where the logic for rendering tuples, including the retention of trailing commas in single-element tuples, should be addressed.

Ready generation: `True`

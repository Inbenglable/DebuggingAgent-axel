After analyzing the API returned content, we need to determine which `__eq__` methods are relevant to the issue described. The issue is about comparing `S(0.0)` and `S.false`, which means we're dealing with objects related to floating point numbers and Boolean values in SymPy. Here is the analysis of each returned item:

1. **sympy/core/numbers.py:Number.__eq__**  
   - This is a base class for numbers and does not provide an implementation but raises `NotImplementedError`. It is not directly relevant.

2. **sympy/core/numbers.py:Float.__eq__**  
   - This is relevant because `S(0.0)` would relate to the `Float` class.

3. **sympy/core/numbers.py:Rational.__eq__**  
   - This could be indirectly relevant since it provides equality checks with rational numbers which might be involved in comparisons indirectly, but since we are dealing with floats `S(0.0)` and no explicit mention of rational within the provided issue, it might not be directly involved.

4. **sympy/core/numbers.py:Integer.__eq__**  
   - This might be indirectly relevant but `S(0.0)` and `S.false` directly do not involve integers.

5. **sympy/core/numbers.py:Infinity.__eq__**  
   - Not relevant to this issue since we're dealing with finite numbers.

6. **sympy/core/numbers.py:NegativeInfinity.__eq__**  
   - Similarly, not relevant due to dealing with finite numbers.

7. **sympy/core/numbers.py:NaN.__eq__**  
   - NaN values are not involved in the issue provided.

8. **sympy/core/numbers.py:NumberSymbol.__eq__**  
   - Potentially relevant as it includes logic for numbers and has conditions for different types of numbers, but "**NumberSymbol != non-(Number|self)**" suggests it doesn't directly pertain to this issue without additional context on boolean handling.

From these analyses, the most directly relevant result is the `Float.__eq__` method due to the involvement of floating point numbers in the issue context. We should focus on understanding how `Float` instances compare against boolean values such as `S.false`.

Therefore, the chosen needed content is:

```
sympy/core/numbers.py:Float.__eq__
```

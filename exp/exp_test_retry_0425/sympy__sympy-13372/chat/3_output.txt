Based on the debugging information, the issue is in the `evalf` method within the `sympy/core/evalf.py` file. To generate a patch, I need to retrieve the source code of this method to understand the logic and make necessary changes to resolve the issue. Therefore, I will search for the `evalf` method in the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/core/evalf.py", "evalf")
```

To resolve the issue, I need to assess the existing implementation of the `Paginator` class. Specifically, I need to locate the `Paginator` class in the codebase to access its current functionality. This will allow me to add the `__iter__` method as described in the issue. Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code for the `Paginator` class.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Paginator")
```

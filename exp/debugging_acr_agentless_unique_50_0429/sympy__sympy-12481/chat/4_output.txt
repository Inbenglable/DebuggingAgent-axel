To resolve the issue, I'll need to review the complete source code of the `__new__` method within the `Permutation` class in the `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` file. This will allow me to fully understand the current implementation, especially how cycles are being processed and where the modifications should be made to handle non-disjoint cycles correctly.

I'll use the following search API to retrieve the method:

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py", "Permutation.__new__")
```

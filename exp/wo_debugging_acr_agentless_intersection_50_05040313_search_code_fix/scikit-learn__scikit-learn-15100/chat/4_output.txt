The issue at hand is related to the `strip_accents_unicode` function in the `scikit-learn` library, where it fails to strip accents from strings that are already in NFKD form. The patch provided is intended to resolve this issue by always removing combining characters, even if the string is originally in normalized form.

**Patch Review:**
- The patch removes the conditional `if normalized == s: return s` which, when present, causes the function to return the original string if it's already in NFKD form.
- However, the patch seems incomplete. It misses the actual replacement code that would strip out combining characters, which should have been the focus here.

**Analysis of Execution:**
- **Original Output:** Demonstrates the failure when `strip_accents_unicode(s2)` returns `s2` unchanged.
- **Patched Output:** Reveals a syntax error due to an indentation mistake in the code. This suggests that if the patch were incorporated into the codebase, it was done incorrectly, leading to an `IndentationError`.

To determine if the issue is resolved, the patched output must demonstrate the successful removal of the accent from `s2`. The test after applying the patch resulted in a syntax error, which indicates the patch could not be tested for functionality due to this code error.

**Conclusion:**
- The patch was intended to fix the issue but was not syntactically correct, leading to an `IndentationError`.
- As such, the actual functionality required to strip accents was not tested, thus leaving the issue unresolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

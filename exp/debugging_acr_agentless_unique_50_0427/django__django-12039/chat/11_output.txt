The test output before and after applying the patch is the same:

```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-12039/reproduce.py", line 9, in <module>
    from django.db.migrations.operations.indexes import AddIndex
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'django.db.migrations.operations.indexes'
```

The error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'django.db.migrations.operations.indexes'` indicates that the test script cannot find the `AddIndex` class in the specified module path. This error prevents the code from running further and testing whether the patch resolves the whitespace issue in the `CREATE INDEX` statements.

The patch provided seems to be addressing the logic in the `Columns.__str__` method to ensure proper spacing when appending `col_suffixes`. However, without successful execution of the test script due to the import error, it's impossible to determine if the issue related to the SQL syntax was fixed.

To resolve this, the import path or the presence of the `AddIndex` class needs to be correctly set up in the test script, allowing it to run the assertions that check for the correct SQL syntax.

Since the test script could not run the assertions due to an import error, the actual bug resolution cannot yet be verified.

Issue resolved: `False`

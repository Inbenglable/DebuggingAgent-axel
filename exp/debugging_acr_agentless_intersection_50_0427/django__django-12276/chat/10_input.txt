<ISSUE>
FileInput shouldn't display required attribute when initial data exists.
Description
	 
		(last modified by thenewguy)
	 
I think that ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute() (â€‹https://github.com/django/django/blob/e703b93a656b78b9b444bb3a9980e305ed002a70/django/forms/widgets.py#L454) should be moved to FileInput.use_required_attribute() so that required is not output on the html input element that represents FileInput when a file is already set (e.g. already saved on a model instance that is being edited).
Maybe I am overlooking a use case where this is not desirable? I can not think of one.

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
To resolve the issue regarding the incorrect display of the 'required' attribute when initial data exists for a file field, we need to examine the behavior of the `use_required_attribute()` method in the Django codebase. The user suggests changing its location from `ClearableFileInput` to `FileInput`.

We need to analyze the implementation of `use_required_attribute()` in the `ClearableFileInput` class within the file `django/forms/widgets.py`. This method is likely responsible for determining if the 'required' attribute should be added to a file input element even when initial data is provided.

Let's observe the method:

Observed method: `django/forms/widgets.py:ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute`
==================================================
The current issue involves ensuring that the 'required' attribute is not added to file input fields when there is initial data. The method in question, `ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute`, is responsible for deciding whether or not to apply the 'required' attribute. This method currently checks if there is initial data and won't apply 'required' if there is any.

The error message you encountered indicates a problem with how the test environment is being set up. This isn't directly related to the initial issue but rather a setup issue. 

We'll want to focus on the logic of `use_required_attribute()` to ensure it behaves as desired when used within `FileInput`. The faulty behavior is likely because this logic does not get invoked when using `FileInput` directly, as the method is part of `ClearableFileInput`.

Given the suggestion in the issue, it seems appropriate to trace how `use_required_attribute()` is defined and used outside the `ClearableFileInput` to develop a comprehensive solution. We need to ensure that this logic is common to all file inputs, whether or not they are cleanable.

Let's proceed by observing the `FileInput.use_required_attribute` method if it exists or analyzing `FileInput` to see how we could integrate `use_required_attribute`.

Observing or finding if it exists leads us to:

Observed scope: `django/forms/widgets.py:FileInput` (to understand its current behavior and capabilities)

If `use_required_attribute()` is not part of `FileInput`, I will check how to appropriately introduce it or modify existing behavior so FileInput can use it as expected when initial data exists.
==================================================
Based on the observed code and runtime information, the `FileInput` class itself, as seen from lines 374 to 387, does not currently have a `use_required_attribute()` method. This is consistent with the issue raised, where `ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute()` should potentially be moved or adapted for `FileInput`.

Given that the immediate task is to ensure `FileInput` behaves correctly when initial data is present, we would need to establish a way for it to determine if the 'required' attribute is necessary, much like how `ClearableFileInput` already does.

The runtime error regarding the test execution indicates that there is an issue with the setup of the test environment being called multiple times, which needs addressing but isn't directly impacting the behavior of the `FileInput` class regarding the 'required' attribute.

Now, to proceed with identifying where the logic needs to be modified or introduced, I'll need to look further into the `ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute()` method to understand how it determines the necessity of the 'required' attribute and how we might introduce similar logic into `FileInput`.

Observed scope: `django/forms/widgets.py:454-470`
==================================================
Based on the analysis, the problem lies in the `use_required_attribute` method within the `ClearableFileInput` class. This method currently ensures that the 'required' attribute is not applied if initial data exists:

```python
def use_required_attribute(self, initial):
    return super().use_required_attribute(initial) and not initial
```

The issue arises because `FileInput` does not by default incorporate this logic, leading to the 'required' attribute being improperly added when initial data exists. Since the `FileInput` class does not inherently utilize this logic, it results in incorrect behavior.

The error related to the "setup_test_environment" being called multiple times is unrelated to the issue at hand regarding the 'required' attribute but indicates a test setup issue.

Thus, the `ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute` method correctly addresses the problem when dealing with `ClearableFileInput`, but this logic is missing in the `FileInput` class.

Next, we need to check how `FileInput` can incorporate `use_required_attribute` logic.

Observed method: `django/forms/widgets.py:FileInput.__init__` (to understand initialization and potential integration for use_required_attribute logic)
==================================================
The root of the issue appears to be in the behavior of the `use_required_attribute()` method within the `FileInput` and `ClearableFileInput`. The essential task is to ensure `FileInput` can check the presence of initial data and decide if the 'required' attribute should be used or not, similar to `ClearableFileInput`.

Currently, the error message "setup_test_environment() was already called and can't be called again without first calling teardown_test_environment()" is unrelated to the form widget logic. This error is occurring due to the way the test environment setup is being managed in the test script, which isn't directly connected to the underlying form widget behavior that relates to the 'required' attribute.

The main area of focus needs to be on enabling `FileInput` to utilize or implement the similar check for initial data when determining the 'required' attribute as implemented in `ClearableFileInput`.

Given the scope already analyzed, it's clear that the issue relies on extending or adapting the `FileInput` class behavior. To address the `setup_test_environment()` issue separately would involve changes to the script structure to prevent redundant calls without ensuring proper teardown; however, this doesn't relate to the form widget issue directly tied to the bug report.

For resolving the primary form widget issue, the focus should remain on aligning `FileInput` behavior regarding `use_required_attribute()`.

I will proceed to further observe the method defining `use_required_attribute()` to finalize on implementing similar functionality in the `FileInput`.

Observed scope: `django/forms/widgets.py:454-470`
==================================================
The observed code snippet is from the `ClearableFileInput` class, which defines the `use_required_attribute()` method responsible for ensuring the 'required' attribute is not added if initial data exists. This logic is correct for `ClearableFileInput`. However, the issue is that `FileInput`, another form widget class in Django, does not have this functionality, leading to the incorrect application of 'required' when there is initial data.

The following runtime information and stack trace hint at a setup issue within the testing script, specifically related to redundant calls to `setup_test_environment()`. This issue is unrelated to the widget logic defect described in the bug report.

The core issue regarding the 'required' attribute arises from the absence of a similar method to handle initial data presence within the `FileInput` widget. Thus, the buggy method is identified as a missing or inadequately implemented piece in `FileInput`.

To resolve the main issue, equivalent functionality as seen in `ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute()` needs to be adapted into `FileInput`. The task is to ensure `FileInput` recognizes initial data and behaves accordingly, potentially by extending or modifying the `use_required_attribute()` logic to `FileInput`.

The test environment error warrants separate attention in the test script setup which causes redundant initialization, as detailed in the test execution traceback.

Therefore, focusing on the main widget logic issue, the buggy behavior area involves `FileInput` logic where `use_required_attribute()` should influence attribute application.

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

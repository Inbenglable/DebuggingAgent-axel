Based on the provided code for the `floatformat` function, the issue arises when dealing with the precision of Decimal values when the input is `'0.00'`. It seems the calculation of `prec` results in a value that is not supported by the `Decimal` context. We need to ensure `prec` does not go below a safe minimum (such as 1) to avoid `ValueError`.

I'll provide a patch to fix this issue by adjusting the calculation of `prec`.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/template/defaultfilters.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    prec = abs(p) + units + 1\n=======\n    prec = max(1, abs(p) + units + 1)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch adds a `max(1, ...)` function around the `prec` calculation to ensure that `prec` never becomes less than 1, preventing a `ValueError` in the `quantize()` call.

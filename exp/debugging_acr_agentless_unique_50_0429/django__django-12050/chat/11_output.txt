To address the issue with the `resolve_lookup_value` method, we will modify it to retain the input type of iterable values while resolving their elements. Here's the necessary patch in a *SEARCH/REPLACE* format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/sql/query.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            value = tuple(resolved_values)\n=======\n            value = type(value)(resolved_values)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This change ensures that the `resolve_lookup_value` method keeps the original input type, whether it's a list or a tuple, when resolving iterable values.

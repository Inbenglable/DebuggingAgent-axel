To address the issue, I need to review the `_check_vocabulary` method within the `CountVectorizer` class, which is invoked in the `get_feature_names` method. This method likely plays a role in determining whether the `NotFittedError` is raised. Knowing how it functions will inform the necessary changes. Let's locate its implementation.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py", "_check_vocabulary")
```

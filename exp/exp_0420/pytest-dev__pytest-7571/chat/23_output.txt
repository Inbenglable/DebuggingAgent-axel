Based on the observed behavior and the provided information, it appears the root of the issue is related to the `caplog` fixture not properly restoring the log level after a test.

The expected behavior as per the documentation is for the log levels set during a test to be automatically restored at the end of the test. However, it seems this is not happening in the provided version of `pytest`.

We should look into the implementation of the `caplog` fixture to understand how it manages the log levels and identify why it isn't restoring them correctly.

To do this, we need to trace the following method:

Observed method: `src/_pytest/logging.py:getlog_fixture`

Let's inspect this method to see how `caplog` is implemented and why it might fail to restore the log level after the test executes.

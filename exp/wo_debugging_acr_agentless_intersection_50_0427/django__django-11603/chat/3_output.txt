To add DISTINCT support for the `Avg` and `Sum` aggregate classes, I need to identify where the DISTINCT keyword is meant to be utilized or checked within their implementation. Given the structure of these classes, I need to look for any place in the base `Aggregate` class or any attributes that determine whether DISTINCT is allowed or utilized in aggregates.

Since I haven't checked the full details of the `Aggregate` class or any existing attributes handling DISTINCT support, I'll need to retrieve the source code of the `Aggregate` class as well, since it's likely where the DISTINCT support logic will be most relevantly applied.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Aggregate")
```

To solve the issue of adding `DISTINCT` support for `Avg` and `Sum` aggregates in Django, I will modify the classes to allow the `distinct` parameter. Here are the edits needed:

1. Update the `Aggregate` base class to allow `DISTINCT` for specific subclasses (`Avg` and `Sum`).
2. Enable the `allow_distinct` attribute for these subclasses.

Let's proceed with the necessary changes in the search/replace format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):\n=======\nclass Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):\n=======\nclass Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch enables the `DISTINCT` support for the `Avg` and `Sum` aggregates by setting the `allow_distinct` flag to `True` in their class definitions.

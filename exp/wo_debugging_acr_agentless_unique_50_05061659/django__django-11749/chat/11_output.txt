The patch involves updating the `call_command` function to handle mutually exclusive groups. The idea is to ensure that arguments in mutually exclusive groups, even if not individually required, are considered collectively required and processed correctly.

### Reviewing the Test Results:

#### Original Output:
- The test failed because the command `'command'` was unknown, leading to a `CommandError`.

#### Patched Output:
- The test gave the same error message, indicating that the issue persists. Again, the command `'command'` is unknown, resulting in a `CommandError`.

### Determining Whether the Issue is Fixed:

The problem described in the issue relates to the handling of mutually exclusive group arguments when using `call_command`. However, both before and after applying the patch, the output is a command error because the custom command class (`Command`) defined in the test is not being recognized by the management utility as a valid command, which is unrelated to the mutually exclusive group argument issue.

The root cause of this is that the test does not properly register or use the custom command (`Command`) for testing purposes, resulting in an `Unknown command` error.

### Conclusion:

Since the patched output does not resolve the core issue described in the bug report and the test still fails with the same `Unknown command` error, the issue is not resolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

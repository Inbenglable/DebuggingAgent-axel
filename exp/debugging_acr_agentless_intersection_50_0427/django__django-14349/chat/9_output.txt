To determine if the issue is resolved, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Issue Description:**  
   The issue lies in the `URLValidator` where tests are failing due to the behavior introduced by the Python patch for bpo-43882. The initial validation did not raise a `ValidationError` for URLs containing newline (`\n`), carriage return (`\r`), or tab (`\t`) characters because these characters were being stripped before reaching the validator.

2. **Original Test Output:**  
   The tests failed as `ValidationError` was not raised for URLs that contained newline characters.

3. **Patch:**  
   The patch introduces a modification in the `__call__` method of `URLValidator`. It adds a check to raise a `ValidationError` if the URL contains any of the disallowed characters (`'\n'`, `'\r'`, `'\t'`). This means the validator now explicitly checks for these characters and raises an error if they are present.

4. **Patched Test Output:**  
   After applying the patch, the test ran without any failures, indicating that the validator is now correctly handling URLs with forbidden characters by raising a `ValidationError`.

Given this analysis, the patch successfully introduces a check for newline, carriage return, and tab characters in the URL, ensuring that a `ValidationError` is raised if any such characters are found. The change in test output from failures to success confirms that the solution is effective.

**Conclusion:**  
Issue resolved: `True`

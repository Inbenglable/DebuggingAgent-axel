I need to retrieve the source code of the `quantity_input` method to examine how it currently handles return type annotations. This will allow me to appropriately modify the code to handle a `None` return annotation properly. 

Let's retrieve the source code for the `quantity_input` method in the `astropy/units/decorators.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/units/decorators.py", "quantity_input")
```

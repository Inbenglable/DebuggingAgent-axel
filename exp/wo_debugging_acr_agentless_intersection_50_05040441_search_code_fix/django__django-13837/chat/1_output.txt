To address the issue of enhancing the `django.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments` to accurately detect when Python is launched with the `-m` flag for packages other than Django, I need to first examine the current implementation of the `get_child_arguments` function in the Django codebase.

I don't have the file path, so I'll start by searching for the method in the whole project codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("get_child_arguments")
```

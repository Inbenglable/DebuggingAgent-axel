To address the issue, I am going to examine the `_safe_first_finite` method within the `cbook` module of the matplotlib project. First, let's retrieve the complete source code of this specific method for a proper analysis and patch generation.

```python
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py", "_safe_first_finite")
```

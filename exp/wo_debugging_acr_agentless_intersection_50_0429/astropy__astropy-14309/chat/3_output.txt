Based on the source code retrieved, the `IndexError` is occurring because the `is_fits` function in `astropy/io/fits/connect.py` attempts to access `args[0]` without checking if `args` actually contains any elements. To resolve this issue, we should include a check to ensure `args` is not empty before attempting to access its first element.

Here is the patch to fix the issue:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### astropy/io/fits/connect.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    return isinstance(args[0], (HDUList, TableHDU, BinTableHDU, GroupsHDU))\n=======\n    return len(args) > 0 and isinstance(args[0], (HDUList, TableHDU, BinTableHDU, GroupsHDU))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch adds a check to ensure that `args` has at least one element before accessing `args[0]`, preventing the `IndexError`.

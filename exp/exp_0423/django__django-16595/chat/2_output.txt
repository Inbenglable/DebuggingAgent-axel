The observed issue is with the migration optimizer in the Django project, where multiple `AlterField` operations are not being reduced to a single operation when optimized. The `optimize` method of `MigrationOptimizer` is being called with a list of `AlterField` operations, but the output does not combine these into a single operation.

The problem seems to be related to how the optimizer handles consecutive `AlterField` operations. The optimizer is expected to reduce these operations similarly to how it would reduce them if they were following an `AddField` operation.

To understand the issue better, it's necessary to look deeper into the internal workings of the optimizer, specifically how it processes and decides whether to combine multiple `AlterField` operations. This will likely involve examining how the optimizer compares fields and decides operation reductions.

Next, I will need to trace into the `MigrationOptimizer.optimize_inner` method because the main `optimize` method calls `optimize_inner`, which carries out the core logic of the optimization process.

Observed method: `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py:MigrationOptimizer.optimize_inner`

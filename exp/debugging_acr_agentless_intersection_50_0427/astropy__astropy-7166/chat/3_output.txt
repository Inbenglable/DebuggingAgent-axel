To resolve the issue with the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass not handling property objects correctly, I need to retrieve the source code for `InheritDocstrings.__init__` from the `astropy/utils/misc.py` file. This will allow me to understand the current implementation and to adjust the logic to handle properties, as well as functions, for docstring inheritance.

Let's retrieve the source code for this method.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/utils/misc.py", "InheritDocstrings.__init__")
```

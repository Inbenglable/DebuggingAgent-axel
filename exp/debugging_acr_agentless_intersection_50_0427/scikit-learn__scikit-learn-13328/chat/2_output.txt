To analyze the abnormal program behavior and identify the root cause of the bug, we start by looking at the stack trace. The error message, "TypeError: The numpy boolean negative, the `-` operator, is not supported, use the `~` operator or the logical_not function instead," highlights an issue with using the negation operator (`-`) on a boolean array.

The error occurs in the `_huber_loss_and_gradient` function in the `huber.py` file, specifically at line 93. From the stack trace, the problematic line is `X_non_outliers = -axis0_safe_slice(X, ~outliers_mask, n_non_outliers)`. This line suggests that a negation operator is being applied to a boolean array resulting in a `TypeError`.

To proceed, observe the `_huber_loss_and_gradient` method to analyze its implementation and understand how to fix the error.

Observed method: `sklearn/linear_model/huber.py:_huber_loss_and_gradient`

To generate the patch, I need to review the source code of the `_sparse_fit` method from the `BaseLibSVM` class located in `sklearn/svm/base.py`. This will allow me to identify where exactly to implement a fix for handling the zero division error when there are no support vectors.

I will proceed to search for the `_sparse_fit` method in the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/svm/base.py", "BaseLibSVM._sparse_fit")
```

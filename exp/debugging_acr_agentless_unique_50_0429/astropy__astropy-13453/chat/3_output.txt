The `write` method in the **BaseReader** class is responsible for writing the table data into a list of strings corresponding to different output formats, including HTML. It processes the table and filters the columns before finalizing the output as defined by the subclass-specific methods for writing headers and data.

The abnormal behavior stems from the `formats` argument not being appropriately respected during the HTML writing process. It suggests that somewhere in the process—likely within the `data.write(lines)` or header handling—the custom formatting for HTML output isn't being applied as it is for other formats.

Since the method `write_header` and `data.write` are called on lines 1515 and 1516, respectively, and these seem crucial for generating the output, we need to explore further how these methods handle formatting, particularly in the HTML context.

Thus, I would choose to observe a specific section concerning the data writing process to HTML to understand where and how the formats might be ignored.

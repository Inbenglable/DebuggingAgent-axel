Based on the issue description and the observed code, the problem is that the `contains.py` file has the method `Contains.as_set()` which raises a `NotImplementedError`. This means that the method is currently not implemented, which leads to the incorrect behavior described in the issue when `Contains(x, Reals).as_set()` is called.

Since the method `Contains.as_set()` is not implemented, we need to locate a place in the code where this method should be properly defined so that it can return a set. The method needs to be designed to convert the `Contains` object into a set representation, which the rest of the code can work with correctly.

Given the current information, the buggy method can be identified as:

Buggy method: `sympy/sets/contains.py:Contains.as_set`

The fix would involve implementing the logic within this method to return the appropriate set based on the `Contains` condition.

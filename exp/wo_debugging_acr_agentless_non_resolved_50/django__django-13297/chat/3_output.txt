Based on the issue and the retrieved code, the problem seems to arise because `kwargs` passed to `get_context_data` includes `SimpleLazyObject`s in Django 3.1, which need to be explicitly converted to strings before use. The `get_context_data` method currently just returns `kwargs` after some modifications.

Since I have the necessary information about the `get_context_data` method from `ContextMixin`, I am ready to generate the patch that deals with `SimpleLazyObject` by converting such objects to a string when accessing `kwargs`.

Ready generation: `True`

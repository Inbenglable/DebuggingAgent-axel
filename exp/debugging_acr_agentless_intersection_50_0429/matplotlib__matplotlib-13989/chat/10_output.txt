Upon reviewing the provided information, here's the analysis:

### Patch Review
- The original problem was that the `plt.hist()` function did not respect the specified `range` parameter when `density=True`.
- The patch correctly modifies how `hist_kwargs` are set by ensuring that existing key-value pairs, such as `range`, are preserved when adding or modifying the `density` key.
- The modification from `hist_kwargs = dict(density=density)` to `hist_kwargs['density'] = density` prevents the `range` parameter from being overwritten or ignored.

### Test Output Analysis
- **Original Output**: The bin range does not start at 0 or end at 1, which is inconsistent with the specified `range=(0, 1)`.
- **Patched Output**: The bins now start at 0 and end at 1, which matches the expected outcome stated in the issue description.

### Conclusion
Both the patch review and the test output analysis indicate that the issue has been resolved. The `plt.hist()` function now respects the specified `range` parameter when `density=True`, as demonstrated by the patched output.

Issue resolved: `True`

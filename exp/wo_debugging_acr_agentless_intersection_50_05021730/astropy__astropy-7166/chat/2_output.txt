To fix the issue with the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass not working for properties, I need to inspect the full implementation of the `InheritDocstrings` class to understand where `inspect.isfunction` is used and how to modify it to accommodate properties effectively.

Therefore, I need to retrieve the complete source code for the `InheritDocstrings` class from the `astropy/utils/misc.py` file.

```python
search_class_in_file("astropy/utils/misc.py", "InheritDocstrings")
```

To resolve the issue, we need to update the `InheritDocstrings.__init__` method to support properties by correctly identifying them and inheriting their docstrings. This requires modifying the current implementation where `inspect.isfunction` is used, and adding support for detecting properties, likely using `inspect.isdatadescriptor`. Here's the patch:

```pythony
### astropy/utils/misc.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            if (inspect.isfunction(val) and
=======
            if ((inspect.isfunction(val) or inspect.isdatadescriptor(val)) and
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change will allow the metaclass to check for both functions and properties, thus inheriting docstrings for properties as well.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### astropy/utils/misc.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            if (inspect.isfunction(val) and\n=======\n            if ((inspect.isfunction(val) or inspect.isdatadescriptor(val)) and\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

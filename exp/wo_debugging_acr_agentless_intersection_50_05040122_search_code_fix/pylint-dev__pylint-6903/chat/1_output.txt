To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code of the `_query_cpu` function in the `pylint/lint/run.py` file to understand how the CPU count is being calculated and where it needs to be fixed to ensure it does not return 0.

```python
search_method_in_file("pylint/lint/run.py", "_query_cpu")
```

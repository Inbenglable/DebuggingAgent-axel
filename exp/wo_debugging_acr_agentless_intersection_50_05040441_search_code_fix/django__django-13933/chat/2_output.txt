To resolve the issue, I need to modify the `default_error_messages` in the `ModelChoiceField` class to include the value of the invalid choice in the `invalid_choice` error message. This will require modifying the part of the code that raises a `ValidationError` using this message.

I need to review the `validate` method within the `ModelChoiceField` class, as this is likely where the `ValidationError` is raised and where the error message can be updated to include the invalid choice.

Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code for the `validate` method in the `ModelChoiceField` class.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/forms/models.py", "ModelChoiceField.validate")
```

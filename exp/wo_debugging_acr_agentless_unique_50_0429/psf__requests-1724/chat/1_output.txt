The issue is with the `requests` library where using a Unicode string for the HTTP method name causes a `UnicodeDecodeError` in Python 2.7.2. To resolve this, I need to examine the relevant code in the `sessions.py` file where the `req.method = method.upper()` line is indicated. This will help us ensure the HTTP method is correctly handled when a Unicode string is provided.

I need to retrieve the surrounding source code of this line in the `sessions.py` file to understand how the method is handled and where to apply the fix to handle Unicode method names properly.

```python
search_code_in_codebase("req.method = method.upper()")
```

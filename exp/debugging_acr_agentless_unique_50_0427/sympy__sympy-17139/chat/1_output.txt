The error trace indicates that there is an invalid comparison involving complex numbers, specifically the complex unit \( I \). The root of the problem arises when attempting to compare complex numbers, which is not a valid operation in Python.

By following the traceback, we see that the error originates from the line containing the code `if (rv.exp < 0) == True` in the `sympy/simplify/fu.py` file at line 504, within the `_f` function. This comparison likely involves a complex exponent, leading to the error.

The observed abnormal behavior starts from the invocation of `simplify(cos(x)**I)`, that internally uses the `trigsimp` function, which further utilizes multiple utility functions, eventually calling the `_f` function where the issue manifests due to comparison with the complex unit \( I \).

Let's continue by observing the method where the comparison operation occurs to gain further insights.

Observed method: `sympy/simplify/fu.py:_f`

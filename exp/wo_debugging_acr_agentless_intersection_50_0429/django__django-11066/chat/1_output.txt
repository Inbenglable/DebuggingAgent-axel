To address the issue at hand, I need to review the source code of the `_rename` method within the `RenameContentType` class located in the specified file. Therefore, I will retrieve the method source code using an appropriate API.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/contenttypes/management/__init__.py", "RenameContentType._rename")
```

To resolve the issue, I need to first retrieve the source code for the `fowlkes_mallows_score` method that is likely located in the `sklearn/metrics/cluster/supervised.py` file. This will allow me to see the current implementation and understand how the calculation of `tk / np.sqrt(pk * qk)` is performed, and then implement the proposed fix.

Here's the API call to retrieve the source code for the `fowlkes_mallows_score` method:

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/metrics/cluster/supervised.py", "fowlkes_mallows_score")
```

To address the issue with `GaussianMixture`, I need to examine the relevant code in the `scikit-learn` project related to the `fit_predict` and `predict` methods of the `GaussianMixture` class. This will help identify why the results differ when `n_init > 1`.

I will search for the `GaussianMixture` class and look for the implementations of the `fit_predict` and `predict` methods in the codebase. 

```python
search_class_in_codebase("GaussianMixture")
search_method_in_codebase("GaussianMixture.fit_predict")
search_method_in_codebase("GaussianMixture.predict")
```

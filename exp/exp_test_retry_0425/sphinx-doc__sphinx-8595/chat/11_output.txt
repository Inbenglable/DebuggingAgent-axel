To resolve the issue regarding the handling of an empty `__all__` attribute in the `get_object_members` method of the `ModuleDocumenter` class, I will modify the logic so that when `__all__` is empty, no members are documented. The fix involves changing the conditional block responsible for processing when `__all__` is empty.

Here is the patch to apply the necessary changes:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                return True, list(members.values())\n=======\n                return False, []\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This change ensures that when `__all__` is empty, the method returns no members instead of all members, addressing the reported bug.

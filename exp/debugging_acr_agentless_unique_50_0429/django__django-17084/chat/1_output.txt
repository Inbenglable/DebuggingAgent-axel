To analyze the issue, we first need to consider the error reported in the test execution:

1. **Python Error during Test Execution**: 
   - The error message `NameError: name 'sys' is not defined` indicates a missing import of the `sys` module in the script used during the test execution (`run_debugging_test.py`). This prevents the test from running as it relies on using `sys.path`.

2. **Django ORM Error**:
   - The issue mentioned describes a problem with using aggregates over window functions after upgrading to Django 4.2. This results in the `psycopg2.errors.GroupingError: aggregate function calls cannot contain window function calls`.

3. **Reproducing the Error**:
   - The test case `TestAggregateOverWindow.test_aggregate_over_window` is designed to reproduce the error by creating sample data and attempting the problematic aggregation.

Given these details, the first step to resolve the immediate technical issue (not related to the ORM but to running the test itself) is to address the missing `sys` module import.

Therefore, before we can resolve the ORM-related issue, the test framework itself needs to function correctly. Since the current test output indicates that the error occurred in `run_debugging_test.py`, we should locate and fix the missing import in this file.

Based on the information provided, I've already retrieved the relevant portions of the `FileSystemStorage` class, including the `_save` method and `__init__` method.

We can observe that the `_save` method handles file saving and contains logic for applying file permissions with `os.chmod`. We can set the `file_permissions_mode` to a default of `0o644` when none is provided.

Given the information collected, I'm ready to generate the patch to address the issue.

Ready generation: `True`

To proceed with generating a patch for the issue, I need to retrieve the source code of the `_cull` method in the `DatabaseCache` class from the file `django/core/cache/backends/db.py`. This will enable me to inspect the current implementation and determine how to introduce the necessary error handling. 

Let's retrieve the source code of the `_cull` method.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/cache/backends/db.py", "DatabaseCache._cull")
```

## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Use subprocess.run and PGPASSWORD for client in postgres backend
Description
	
â€‹subprocess.run was added in python 3.5 (which is the minimum version since Django 2.1). This function allows you to pass a custom environment for the subprocess.
Using this in django.db.backends.postgres.client to set PGPASSWORD simplifies the code and makes it more reliable.

In the previous round, you called search APIs to retrieve relevant source code that would help identify the root cause of the issue and generate a patch. However, the code you retrieved appears in multiple locations (maybe some are irrelevant but have same key). So now your task is to determine which of the retrieved contents are indeed you need, and filter out the irrelevant ones.
This is your API invocation round output:
To implement the `subprocess.run` with `PGPASSWORD` in Django's PostgreSQL backend, it is crucial to locate and modify the appropriate method. Currently, I haven't identified the relevant method or class within the Django PostgreSQL backend, specifically `django.db.backends.postgresql`.

Based on the provided results, it looks like there might be a connection with the `DatabaseClient` class since there is a reference to `DatabaseClient.runshell_db(dbinfo)` in the retrieved test code.

To proceed:

1. I need to search the class `DatabaseClient` within the PostgreSQL backend to understand how it runs the PostgreSQL shell or client command.
2. I need to explore the method that is responsible for executing the shell command, potentially involving environment variables.

I'll perform searches targeting these specific components to acquire necessary details for the patch.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("DatabaseClient")
search_method_in_codebase("runshell_db")
```

And this is the corresponding API returned result (each content is started with #### FILE_PATH:NAME):
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_class_in_codebase("DatabaseClient")
RESULT:
#### django/db/backends/oracle/client.py:DatabaseClient
```python
class DatabaseClient(BaseDatabaseClient):
    executable_name = 'sqlplus'
    wrapper_name = 'rlwrap'

    def runshell(self):
        ...
```

#### django/db/backends/sqlite3/client.py:DatabaseClient
```python
class DatabaseClient(BaseDatabaseClient):
    executable_name = 'sqlite3'

    def runshell(self):
        ...
```

#### django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py:DatabaseClient
```python
class DatabaseClient(BaseDatabaseClient):
    executable_name = 'psql'

    @classmethod
    def runshell_db(cls, conn_params):
        ...

    def runshell(self):
        ...
```

#### django/db/backends/dummy/base.py:DatabaseClient
```python
class DatabaseClient(BaseDatabaseClient):
    runshell = complain
```

#### django/db/backends/mysql/client.py:DatabaseClient
```python
class DatabaseClient(BaseDatabaseClient):
    executable_name = 'mysql'

    @classmethod
    def settings_to_cmd_args(cls, settings_dict):
        ...

    def runshell(self):
        ...
```



Among the API returned contents, there may be some irrelevant ones or not. So now you need to analyze each returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.
Now, please first analyze the API returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.

Then you need to choose you needed ones with the following format:
```
FILE_PATH_1:NAME_1
FILE_PATH_2:NAME_2
...
```

Note:
1. The value of FILE_PATH:NAME, must consistent with the API returned content (but remove the prefix ####).
2. You may select one or more contents, or even all of them if they are indeed you need.

To resolve the issue, we need to modify the behavior of the `HuberRegressor` class so that it can handle a boolean array as input by converting it to a float array similar to how `LinearRegression` does. To do this, I need the implementation details of the `fit` method in the `HuberRegressor` class to identify where the conversion should be applied.

Let's retrieve the source code for the `HuberRegressor` class and its `fit` method.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("HuberRegressor")
search_method_in_codebase("HuberRegressor.fit")
```

To address the issue, I need to examine the source code of the `use_required_attribute` method in `ClearableFileInput` since it was suggested that the method should move to `FileInput`. I will retrieve the implementation of `ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute` to understand its current functionality.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute")
```

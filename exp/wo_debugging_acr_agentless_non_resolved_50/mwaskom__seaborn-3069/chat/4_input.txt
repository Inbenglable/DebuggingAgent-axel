## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Nominal scale should be drawn the same way as categorical scales
Three distinctive things happen on the categorical axis in seaborn's categorical plots:

1. The scale is drawn to +/- 0.5 from the first and last tick, rather than using the normal margin logic
2. A grid is not shown, even when it otherwise would be with the active style
3. If on the y axis, the axis is inverted

It probably makes sense to have `so.Nominal` scales (including inferred ones) do this too. Some comments on implementation:

1. This is actually trickier than you'd think; I may have posted an issue over in matplotlib about this at one point, or just discussed on their gitter. I believe the suggested approach is to add an invisible artist with sticky edges and set the margin to 0. Feels like a hack! I might have looked into setting the sticky edges _on the spine artist_ at one point?

2. Probably straightforward to do in `Plotter._finalize_figure`. Always a good idea? How do we defer to the theme if the user wants to force a grid? Should the grid be something that is set in the scale object itself

3. Probably straightforward to implement but I am not exactly sure where would be best.

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To address the described issue, we need to examine how `seaborn` currently handles categorical and nominal scales, particularly focusing on how the `Plotter._finalize_figure` method and any relevant scale-specific logic are implemented. The task suggests modifying the behavior for `Nominal` scales to align with the treatment of categorical scales, which includes axis margin settings, grid visibility, and axis inversion.

To proceed effectively, I need to:
1. Look at the implementation of the `Plotter._finalize_figure` method to understand how it finalizes plots, especially for categorical axes.
2. Explore any relevant classes or methods related to axis scale management that could influence how nominal scales are drawn.

I will start by searching for the `Plotter._finalize_figure` method within the `seaborn` codebase. Since there's also mention of adjustments regarding scale, it might be useful to look into `Nominal` or related scale classes, if they exist.

==================================================

Your Output:
To resolve the issue, we need to ensure that the `Nominal` scales behave similarly to categorical scales in terms of axis margin settings, grid visibility, and axis inversion, when used with `seaborn` plots. 

The methods we need to explore further are:
1. `Plotter._finalize_figure`: We already have its source code.
2. `Nominal._setup`: It's likely within the `Nominal` class and could be relevant because it might influence how the nominal scales are configured.
3. The categorization and selection logic within the `Nominal` class for handling `Nominal` scales and how it interacts with the plot settings.

Given that I have seen `Nominal.setup` hinted for modification, I will retrieve the source code for `Nominal._setup` if not fully visible already, to ensure we can make the necessary adjustments for aligning the nominal scale behavior with categorical scale traits.

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

To address this issue, I need to analyze how parallelism is implemented in the `KMeans` fit method and why this might lead to different results. This involves retrieving the source code for the `KMeans.fit` method and potentially the `k_means` function it depends on, as this is where the parallelization seems to occur.

I'll start by retrieving the source code for the `fit` method in the `KMeans` class.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/cluster/k_means_.py", "KMeans.fit")
search_method_in_file("sklearn/cluster/k_means_.py", "k_means")
```

To address the issue with `test_huge_range_log`, we should focus on the `LogNorm.__call__()` method in `lib/matplotlib/colors.py`. This is where the error is triggered due to invalid `vmin` or `vmax`. Given that `NoNorm.__call__()` simply returns the input value without any processing or normalization, it is unlikely to be directly involved in the root cause of the issue.

The error arises when `LogNorm` encounters extreme values that cannot be processed correctly. The problematic line is where the logarithm transformation of `vmin` and `vmax` occurs, and this is where non-finite results can emerge if the input values include impossible-to-transform numbers (negative or zero).

Thus, I should trace deeper into the `LogNorm.__call__()` method to identify exactly where and why the logarithm transformation is failing. 

Observed scope: `lib/matplotlib/colors.py:1468-1480`

This will focus on capturing the specific lines of code involved in applying the transformation and checking the finiteness of `t_vmin` and `t_vmax`.

Based on the current analysis, the problem arises from the conversion of `\r` to `\n` within the `readouterr()` method of `_capture`. The return value from this method is directly affecting the final output observed in the test, showing as `'Greetings from DOS\n'` instead of `'Greetings from DOS\r'`. 

This suggests that some form of processing or handling is converting carriage returns to newlines at this point. To pinpoint the exact cause, a deeper examination of the `_capture.readouterr()` method is needed since it is inside this method where the transformation seems to occur.

Thus, I will continue tracing by examining the `_capture.readouterr()` call, focusing specifically on the section of code where the read operation occurs and any related transformations might be happening.

Observed scope: `src/_pytest/capture.py:795-795`

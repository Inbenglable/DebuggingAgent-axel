The runtime information indicates that there is an `ImproperlyConfigured` error occurring because the Django settings have not been properly set up. This prevents the test script from running correctly, and as such the KeyError cannot be observed directly.

The error message shows that the settings for `INSTALLED_APPS` are not configured, which is required for the Django application and its models to be properly recognized and instantiated. This setting needs to be resolved for the environment to work correctly, allowing us to address the actual `KeyError` issue with the `MigrationAutodetector`.

Given that the `ImproperlyConfigured` error is related to misconfiguration of Django settings, and is unrelated to the original `KeyError` issue in the migration autodetector, we need to resolve this test configuration issue first before proceeding.

To locate the buggy method causing the `KeyError`, we should investigate the `MigrationAutodetector`. More specifically, the `generate_renamed_models()` method within this class was identified to be the part where the access to the 'to' key in the deconstruction process occurs. 

Let's observe the next relevant method to identify the direct cause of the `KeyError`. Since previous analysis pointed out the `generate_renamed_models` method as an area where this issue might arise, continuing with its observation is logical.

Observed method: `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py:MigrationAutodetector.generate_renamed_models`

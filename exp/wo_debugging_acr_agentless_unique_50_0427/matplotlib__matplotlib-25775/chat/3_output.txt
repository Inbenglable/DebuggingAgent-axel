To address the issue and implement `get/set_antialiased` for the `Text` objects, I need to analyze existing implementations of `set_antialiased` methods in other classes, especially those related to artist objects or rendering. These examples provide insights into how antialiasing settings are managed and applied, potentially involving both core functionality and graphical context interaction.

Here is the analysis of the API returned content:

1. **lib/matplotlib/patches.py:Patch.set_antialiased**: This method manages antialiasing for patch objects, using `mpl.rcParams` for default values when none are specified. Relevant for understanding per-object antialiasing management.

2. **lib/matplotlib/lines.py:Line2D.set_antialiased**: This method sets antialiasing for line objects and involves managing an internal state and marking the object as stale. Similar internal state management could be applied to `Text` objects.

3. **lib/matplotlib/backend_bases.py:GraphicsContextBase.set_antialiased**: This method sets antialiasing at a more fundamental level, using integer values to ensure compatibility with extension code. Provides a perspective on backend interaction, which is relevant for applying settings during rendering.

4. **lib/matplotlib/collections.py:Collection.set_antialiased**: This method shows how to manage antialiasing for multiple elements (a collection), using lists and numpy for internal representation. Useful for understanding more complex or varied antialiasing setting scenarios.

5. **lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_cairo.py:GraphicsContextCairo.set_antialiased**: This method demonstrates interaction with a specific backend (Cairo), highlighting how backend-specific code handles antialiasing. Relevant for understanding how `Text` might need to interact with different backends.

Given these analyses, I need examples that show the implementation of `set_antialiased` in typical artist objects and backends:

```
lib/matplotlib/patches.py:Patch.set_antialiased
lib/matplotlib/lines.py:Line2D.set_antialiased
lib/matplotlib/backend_bases.py:GraphicsContextBase.set_antialiased
lib/matplotlib/collections.py:Collection.set_antialiased
lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_cairo.py:GraphicsContextCairo.set_antialiased
```

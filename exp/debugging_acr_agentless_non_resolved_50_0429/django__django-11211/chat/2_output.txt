The error message indicates that the Django settings are not configured correctly before attempting to access the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting. Specifically, it shows an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception. This is a common issue when accessing Django components that require initialization of settings.

The root of the issue in the `reproduce.py` test script can be identified early on. The error occurs when trying to import `GenericForeignKey` from `django.contrib.contenttypes.fields`, as any Django model-related import immediately requires access to Django settings, and they are not yet configured at that point in the script.

Letâ€™s focus on the initial part of the script where configuration happens to ensure the settings are properly set up before any Django imports are attempted.

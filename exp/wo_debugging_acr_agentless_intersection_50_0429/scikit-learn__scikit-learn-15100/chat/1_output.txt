To resolve the issue with the `strip_accents_unicode` function, I need to retrieve its source code first. This will allow me to examine how it handles the string normalization and identify the part where it's failing to strip accents from strings in NFKD form.

As I don't have the file path for this method, I'll search the method in the whole project codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("strip_accents_unicode")
```

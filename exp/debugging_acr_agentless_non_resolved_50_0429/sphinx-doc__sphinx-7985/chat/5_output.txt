To proceed with generating a patch for the identified issue, I first need to examine the source code for the `CheckExternalLinksBuilder.check_thread` method, specifically focusing on how it handles local links. This will allow me to understand what changes are necessary to implement checks for local (internal) links effectively.

Therefore, I will retrieve the source code for the `check_thread` method within the `CheckExternalLinksBuilder` class located in the `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py", "CheckExternalLinksBuilder.check_thread")
```

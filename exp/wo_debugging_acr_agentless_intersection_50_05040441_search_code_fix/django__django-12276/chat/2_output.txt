Based on the information retrieved, we have the code for the `ClearableFileInput` class and its `use_required_attribute` method. We also have the `FileInput` class code but not yet its implementation for the `use_required_attribute` method, which seemingly does not contain this method explicitly. The plan is to adjust the behavior of `FileInput` by implementing `use_required_attribute` in it, using the logic from `ClearableFileInput` if suitable.

I'll proceed to generating the patch by implementing the `use_required_attribute` method directly in the `FileInput` class.

Ready generation: `True`

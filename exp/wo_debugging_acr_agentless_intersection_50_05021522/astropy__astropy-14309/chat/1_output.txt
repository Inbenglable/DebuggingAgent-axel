To resolve the issue related to the `identify_format` method in the Astropy project, I need to examine the source code of the `identify_format` method and the associated function where the error is occurring. 

I'll begin by looking for the `identify_format` method in the codebase to understand how it operates and where the error might be introduced. Additionally, I'll search for the relevant section in `astropy/io/fits/connect.py` to find the `is_fits` function, which seems to be the direct source of the error. Here's the initial search for the source code:

```python
search_method_in_codebase("identify_format")
search_method_in_file("astropy/io/fits/connect.py", "is_fits")
```

To resolve the issue, I need to analyze both returned contents and determine if they are relevant to addressing the bug.

#### Analysis of Returned Contents:

1. **sympy/physics/units/quantities.py:Quantity._collect_factor_and_dimension**
   - This method issues a deprecation warning indicating that it has been moved to the `UnitSystem` class.
   - It calls `UnitSystem.get_unit_system(unit_system)._collect_factor_and_dimension(expr)`, essentially forwarding the functionality to the `UnitSystem` class.
   - This indicates that it is not implementing the functionality itself but deferring it to another method in the `UnitSystem` class.
   - **Conclusion:** This content is not directly needed. It serves as a deprecated method that forwards the call.

2. **sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py:UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension**
   - This is the actual implementation of the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method.
   - It contains logic to process different types of expressions such as `Mul`, `Pow`, `Add`, `Derivative`, and `Function`.
   - The handling of `Pow`, especially the dimension checking and adjustment, is directly relevant because the issue is related to exponent dimensions in expressions.
   - **Conclusion:** This content is needed because it contains the core logic handling expressions and dimensions, which is central to resolving the bug.

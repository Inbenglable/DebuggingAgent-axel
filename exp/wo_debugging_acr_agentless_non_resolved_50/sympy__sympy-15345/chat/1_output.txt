To resolve the issue, I need to locate the method that handles the conversion to Mathematica code for the `Max` function in the sympy library. This likely involves the `mathematica_code` function. To proceed, I'll search for its source code within the sympy codebase.

I'll use the following search methods:

```python
search_method_in_codebase("mathematica_code")
```

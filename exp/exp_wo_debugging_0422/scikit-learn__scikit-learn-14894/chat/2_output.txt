I have obtained the source code of the `_sparse_fit` method in the `BaseLibSVM` class within the `sklearn/svm/base.py` file. Based on the provided traceback and code, the `ZeroDivisionError` occurs due to the `dual_coef_indices.size / n_class` calculation when `n_class` or `support_vectors_` is zero.

To fix this issue, I need to add a check to handle the case where the `support_vectors_` attribute is empty.

Given the details already available from the `BaseLibSVM` class and the `_sparse_fit` method, I can proceed to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

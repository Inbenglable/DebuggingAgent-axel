To resolve this issue, I need to find the specific method in the `django.db.backends.postgres.client` that handles subprocess execution for PostgreSQL connections. The search result for "client" wasn't useful, as it led to a different part of the codebase.

To locate the correct method, I should conduct a further search specifically within the PostgreSQL backend's client code. Given the common structure of Django database backends, the relevant code is likely situated in the directory `django/db/backends/postgresql/`. I need to search the codebase to locate methods related to subprocess handling within this module.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("subprocess")
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py", "runshell")
```

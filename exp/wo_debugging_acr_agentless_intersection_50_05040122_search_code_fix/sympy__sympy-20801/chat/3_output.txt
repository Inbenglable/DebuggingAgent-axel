Based on the information retrieved, I need to inspect the `__eq__` methods of both the `Expr` and `Boolean` classes to understand their equality behaviors. Although we've seen their definitions and some details, having the exact implementation of these methods will help ensure a precise modification to resolve the issue.

Let's retrieve the source code of the `Boolean.__eq__` method in the `sympy/logic/boolalg.py` file, since this file is probable where the `Boolean` class is defined, and explore the `Expr.__eq__` method further in `sympy/core/expr.py`.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/logic/boolalg.py", "Boolean.__eq__")
search_method_in_file("sympy/core/expr.py", "Expr.__eq__")
```

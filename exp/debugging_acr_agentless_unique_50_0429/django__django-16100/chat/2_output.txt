The error output indicates that the Django settings are not configured properly, which is preventing the script from running. The test script attempts to import Django models and use Django's ORM functionalities, which require access to the project's settings, including `INSTALLED_APPS`.

Currently, the error occurs because the environment variable `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is not set before importing Django modules that rely on settings. The script attempts to access Django's model layer through imports, which trigger this error when the Django environment isn't fully initialized with settings.

To proceed, there are two main tasks observed:
1. Ensure the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is properly set before any Django component that depends on the settings is accessed.
2. Wrap the critical section that modifies the database in a transaction to ensure database integrity, as identified in the issue description.

The test fails because of the `django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured` error during the import of `User` from `django.contrib.auth.models`. This implies we're currently in the setup phase where Django's environment needs configuration.

As the error happens at this configuration step, the next logical step is to ensure proper settings configuration when the environment is initialized before running the test code.

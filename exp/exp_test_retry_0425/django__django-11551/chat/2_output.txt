The issue with Django's `admin.E108` error is related to how fields in `list_display` are validated. Specifically, it pertains to fields that are accessible only via instances, like those defined using `PositionField` from the `django-positions` library. Under Django version 2.2.1, the logic for checking `list_display` incorrectly raises an `admin.E108` error due to changes in the `_check_list_display_item` method.

**Analysis of `_check_list_display_item` Method:**

The `_check_list_display_item` method runs a series of checks that lead to the error:
- It verifies if `item` is callable.
- It checks if `item` is an attribute of `obj`.
- It checks if `item` is an attribute of `obj.model`.
- Attempts to get the field using `obj.model._meta.get_field(item)`.

This current logic fails when a descriptor returns `None`, as is the case with `PositionField` when accessed from the model class rather than an instance. The erroneous part is that when `hasattr` returns `False`, it should attempt to get the field via `get_field`, regardless of `hasattr`.

The issue is in:
- **Line 723**: The logic checks `hasattr(obj.model, item)` directly to validate `list_display` items.
- **Line 739-749**: The method raises an `admin.E108` error prematurely if attribute checks fail, without adequately considering fields accessible only through instances.

This leads to incorrect validation output, thus preventing proper startup when using fields with descriptors linked to instances.

**Action:**

Given the analysis, the issue indeed lies within the code of the `_check_list_display_item` method. We identified that the method from the `django/contrib/admin/checks.py` needs modification to ensure it doesn't inadvertently raise `admin.E108` due to its current check logic.

**Buggy Method Location:**
```plaintext
Buggy method: django/contrib/admin/checks.py:_check_list_display_item
```

The fix should adjust the logic by ensuring that a `FieldDoesNotExist` exception triggers, allowing for validation based on `get_field` rather than relying solely on `hasattr`, and checks the existence and nature of a field after both attempts.

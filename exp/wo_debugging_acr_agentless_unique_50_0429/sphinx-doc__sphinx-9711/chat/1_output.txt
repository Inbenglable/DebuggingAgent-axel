To resolve this issue, we need to update the logic for comparing extension versions in the `needs_extensions` check. This will likely involve modifying a method responsible for performing version checks. Before we can generate a patch, we need to locate and review the code that handles version comparison.

I'll start by searching for a method that might be responsible for checking or validating extension versions. Given the nature of the issue, this method might be in a file related to Sphinx extensions or configuration validation.

Let's search for methods related to version checking in the codebase first.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("check_extension_version")
search_method_in_codebase("validate_extension_version")
search_method_in_codebase("validate_version")
search_method_in_codebase("check_version")
```

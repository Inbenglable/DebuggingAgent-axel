## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
flush() on self.stdout/stderr management commands doesn't work.
Description
	
flush() is notably called during migrate command; it doesn't work, and a long migration effectively prints to stderr no relevant information up until the end:
Operations to perform:
 Apply all migrations: myapp
Running migrations:
Then nothing more, but the migration is being done.
Then at the end of the real migration, the rest is flushed:
 Applying myapp.0002_auto_20200817_1030... OK
Expected behavior:
Operations to perform:
 Apply all migrations: myapp
Running migrations:
 Applying myapp.0002_auto_20200817_1030...
then work
then OK

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
The issue seen with the provided script is related to the usage of the `captured_output` function from Django's testing utilities. The error message: `TypeError: captured_output() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given` indicates that more arguments are being passed to `captured_output` than it expects.

Hereâ€™s the problem breakdown:

- The `captured_output` function is intended to capture output within a context manager, but the way it's currently being called with two positional arguments `'stdout'` and `'stderr'` does not match its expected parameters.

Based on this, the bug certainly lies with the incorrect usage of the `captured_output` context manager. It should be called without specifying output types like `'stdout'` and `'stderr'` directly as arguments. Normally, it captures both `stdout` and `stderr` just by being used within a context.

This points to the faulty section directly, without needing to trace into further methods or files, as the problem is isolated in the script's incorrect use of the Django testing utility.

Buggy method: `reproduce.py:Command.handle`
==================================================

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To address the issue effectively, I need to review the `handle` method in the `Command` class found in the `reproduce.py` file, as indicated in the debugging history. I'll retrieve the source code for this method to fully understand the context and usage of the `captured_output` function. 

```python
search_method_in_file("reproduce.py", "Command.handle")
```

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

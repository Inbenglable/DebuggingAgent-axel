To fix the issue, I need to replace the manual copying of method metadata (like name and docstring) with `functools.wraps`. The source code of the `create_method` function, which is where the wrapping occurs, has already been retrieved. Therefore, I can proceed to generate the patch without additional code retrieval.

Ready generation: `True`

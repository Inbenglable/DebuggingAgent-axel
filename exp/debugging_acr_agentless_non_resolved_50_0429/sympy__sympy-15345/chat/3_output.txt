To resolve this issue, we need to understand why the `mathematica_code` function is outputting `'Max(2, x)'` instead of the expected `'Max[x, 2]'`. The key aspects of this issue are:

1. **Initialization and Evaluation**: The `Max` object is being initialized with two arguments (symbol `x` and integer `2`), but the order is not preserved. This suggests a possible issue with the order handling or representation of arguments within the `Max` function's internal logic.

2. **Printing Logic**: The conversion of symbolic expressions to strings in a format suitable for Mathematica might be incorrect or incomplete in handling the specific structure of `Max`.

The abnormal behavior is occurring during:
- **Input**: `Max(x, 2)` is created successfully.
- **Output**: Wrong string format from `mathematica_code`.

Given the current trace, the problem likely lies in the `mathematica_code` function or its related printing mechanisms.

To trace the source of the issue effectively, the immediate next step is to observe the method responsible for converting the `Max` function to Mathematica code, which is likely within `MCodePrinter.doprint()` or its related methods since `mathematica_code` calls `MCodePrinter(settings).doprint(expr)`. 

Let's focus on the method that handles this expression's conversion to a string.

Observed method: `sympy/printing/mathematica.py:MCodePrinter.doprint`

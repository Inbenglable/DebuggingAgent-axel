Based on the issue description, the problem is occurring in the `fowlkes_mallows_score` function found in the `sklearn/metrics/cluster/supervised.py` file. To ensure the fix is applied correctly, I need to review the implementation of this function.

Let's proceed to retrieve the source code of the `fowlkes_mallows_score` method.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/metrics/cluster/supervised.py", "fowlkes_mallows_score")
```

To resolve the issue, I need to check the implementation details of where the validation error for `invalid_choice` is raised in the `ModelChoiceField`. The `validate` method currently calls the superclass's (`Field`) `validate` method, and does not handle the invalid choice scenario directly. It is likely that either the `to_python` or another method is responsible for raising the `ValidationError`, potentially the `prepare_value` method. Thus, retrieving more information from these methods would be beneficial.

I will use the search API to retrieve the source code for these methods, starting with `to_python`, as it is commonly known to convert submitted values and handle validation.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/forms/models.py", "ModelChoiceField.to_python")
search_method_in_file("django/forms/models.py", "ModelChoiceField.prepare_value")
```

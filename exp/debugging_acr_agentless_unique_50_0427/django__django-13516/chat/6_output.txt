In order to resolve the issue, I will correct the usage of the `captured_output` context manager in the `handle` method. Specifically, I will remove the arguments passed to `captured_output` as it doesn't require them. I'll make the necessary changes in the code.

Here is the patch:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### reproduce.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        # Capture the output of the migrate command\n        with captured_output('stdout', 'stderr') as (out, err):\n=======\n        # Capture the output of the migrate command\n        with captured_output() as (out, err):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This edit will ensure that `captured_output` is used correctly without any arguments, which aligns with how the function is supposed to be used to capture both `stdout` and `stderr` implicitly.

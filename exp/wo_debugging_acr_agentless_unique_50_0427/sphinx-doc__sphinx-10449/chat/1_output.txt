To address this issue, I'll need to inspect the source code responsible for handling the `autodoc_typehints = "description"` configuration in Sphinx, specifically within the `autodoc` extension. I suspect the method dealing with rendering class and method types for documentation will be key. I'll start by examining the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` extension to locate where the return types might be processed and included.

Let's search for relevant code in the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` module:

```python
search_code_in_codebase("autodoc_typehints")
search_method_in_codebase("add_documenter")
search_method_in_codebase("ClassDocumenter")
```

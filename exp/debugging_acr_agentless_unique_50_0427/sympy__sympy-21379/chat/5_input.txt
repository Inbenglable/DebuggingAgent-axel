Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions
I am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.

See the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.

Sympy version: 1.8.dev

```python
from sympy import *
from sympy.core.cache import clear_cache

x, y, z = symbols('x y z')

clear_cache()
expr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))
# This works fine
expr.subs({1: 1.0})

clear_cache()
x, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)
expr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))
# This fails with "PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense"
expr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error
# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error
expr.subs({1: 1.0})
```

I am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-

- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds
- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`
- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)
- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)

Not too sure how to debug this one.

This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
To start diagnosing the issue, we should first inspect the execution path leading to the `PolynomialError`. Based on the code involved in the error, it most likely relates to the execution path when substitutions occur alongside specific function compositions like `exp`, `sinh`, and `Piecewise`.

Let's begin by examining the method that triggers the `PolynomialError` during the substitution process when the expression involves `Piecewise`. The method responsible for handling substitutions in expressions is typically linked to `Expr.subs` or methods dealing with symbolic manipulations involving polynomials.

Next, it is essential to analyze how the polynomial tools interact with `Piecewise` expressions because the error message "Piecewise generators do not make sense" suggests an issue with polynomial generation from a `Piecewise` expression. Thus, the focus should be on methods invoked within `subs` that attempt polynomial manipulations.

Observed method: `sympy/core/basic.py:Basic.subs`
==================================================
Based on the information provided, the issue occurs when using the `subs()` method on an expression involving hyperbolic functions and `Piecewise()`, with the presence of polynomial-related operations triggering the error. Specifically, the error is a `PolynomialError` citing "Piecewise generators do not make sense", which suggests a problematic interaction between `Piecewise` expressions and polynomial manipulation processes.

Let's review the insights so far:
- The `subs()` method in `sympy/core/basic.py` is involved when the error arises.
- The error occurs particularly with expressions embodying certain function compositions and only when `x` and `y` are real.
- The `subs()` method involves processing sequences of substitution pairs and deciding whether a simultaneous substitution is necessary.
- The run-time observation indicates the need to trace how substitutions involving `Piecewise` are managed, possibly examining interactions with methods that handle polynomial operations or modifications within `subs()`.

To diagnose the issue, we need a deeper understanding of the operations within the scope that likely triggers interactions with polynomials and `Piecewise` objects. More specifically, let's investigate how polynomial manipulation or expression conversion takes place within the `_subs()` method calls when `Piecewise` expressions are present. This could reveal why a `PolynomialError` is thrown in certain conditions (real symbols and complex function compositions).

Therefore, I would like to continue observing the execution path by focusing on the deeper details within a specific code block from `Basic.subs` that seems to be the decision-making centerpiece for substitutions and interacts intensively with lower-level substitution functions:

Observed scope: `sympy/core/basic.py:947-949`
==================================================
Analyzing the current situation, we encounter an error message when attempting to run tests, specifically an `AssertionError` within the `pysnooper` tracing setup. This is unrelated to the core program being debugged and instead indicates a fault in the debugging or test framework setup, particularly in locating the file path for tracing.

In terms of the main program logic relevant to our issue, we're zeroing in on lines within the `Basic.subs` method in `sympy/core/basic.py`:

```python
947   rv = self
948   for old, new in sequence:
949       rv = rv._subs(old, new, **kwargs)
```

Here, the key operation is the loop iterating over substitution pairs, applying each old-new substitution pair using the private method `_subs()`, which is where symbolic calculations and handling of special forms like `Piecewise` would delve deeper.

The `PolynomialError` being raised suggests that within this process, somehow a polynomial-related operation is being incorrectly applied to a `Piecewise` expression, potentially due to some assumption mismatches or erroneous expression simplification/handling logic deeper inside `_subs()` or any subsequent logic interacting with it.

Thus, the next logical step involves inspecting the `_subs()` method itself, as it's directly responsible for executing changes during substitution and is likely where the error in managing `Piecewise` expressions originates.

Observed method: `sympy/core/basic.py:Basic._subs`
==================================================


Now you choose downstream method Basic._subs to further observe, tracing the abnormal program behavior.
This is the method code:
   955	    def _subs(self, old, new, **hints):
   956	        """Substitutes an expression old -> new.
   957	
   958	        If self is not equal to old then _eval_subs is called.
   959	        If _eval_subs doesn't want to make any special replacement
   960	        then a None is received which indicates that the fallback
   961	        should be applied wherein a search for replacements is made
   962	        amongst the arguments of self.
   963	
   964	        >>> from sympy import Add
   965	        >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z
   966	
   967	        Examples
   968	        ========
   969	
   970	        Add's _eval_subs knows how to target x + y in the following
   971	        so it makes the change:
   972	
   973	        >>> (x + y + z).subs(x + y, 1)
   974	        z + 1
   975	
   976	        Add's _eval_subs doesn't need to know how to find x + y in
   977	        the following:
   978	
   979	        >>> Add._eval_subs(z*(x + y) + 3, x + y, 1) is None
   980	        True
   981	
   982	        The returned None will cause the fallback routine to traverse the args and
   983	        pass the z*(x + y) arg to Mul where the change will take place and the
   984	        substitution will succeed:
   985	
   986	        >>> (z*(x + y) + 3).subs(x + y, 1)
   987	        z + 3
   988	
   989	        ** Developers Notes **
   990	
   991	        An _eval_subs routine for a class should be written if:
   992	
   993	            1) any arguments are not instances of Basic (e.g. bool, tuple);
   994	
   995	            2) some arguments should not be targeted (as in integration
   996	               variables);
   997	
   998	            3) if there is something other than a literal replacement
   999	               that should be attempted (as in Piecewise where the condition
  1000	               may be updated without doing a replacement).
  1001	
  1002	        If it is overridden, here are some special cases that might arise:
  1003	
  1004	            1) If it turns out that no special change was made and all
  1005	               the original sub-arguments should be checked for
  1006	               replacements then None should be returned.
  1007	
  1008	            2) If it is necessary to do substitutions on a portion of
  1009	               the expression then _subs should be called. _subs will
  1010	               handle the case of any sub-expression being equal to old
  1011	               (which usually would not be the case) while its fallback
  1012	               will handle the recursion into the sub-arguments. For
  1013	               example, after Add's _eval_subs removes some matching terms
  1014	               it must process the remaining terms so it calls _subs
  1015	               on each of the un-matched terms and then adds them
  1016	               onto the terms previously obtained.
  1017	
  1018	           3) If the initial expression should remain unchanged then
  1019	              the original expression should be returned. (Whenever an
  1020	              expression is returned, modified or not, no further
  1021	              substitution of old -> new is attempted.) Sum's _eval_subs
  1022	              routine uses this strategy when a substitution is attempted
  1023	              on any of its summation variables.

The issue described is that when outputting an ASCII table to HTML format, the `formats` argument is ignored, which results in numbers not being formatted as specified in the arguments. The reproducer script demonstrates this issue, and the trace obtained shows the steps where the table creation, copying, and the attempts to utilize the HTML format occurs.

From the trace, we identify that the `tc.write` method eventually calls `self.registry.write`, found in `astropy/table/connect.py`, but the specific handling for handling the `formats` argument seems to be overlooked or bypassed in this chain of function calls. 

To proceed, we need to determine where in the code path the `formats` argument should have influenced the HTML output but did not. The next step would involve observing the method where `formats` is utilized, most likely within the registry's HTML writing implementation.

Observed method: `astropy/io/registry/interface.py:UnifiedReadWriteMethod.__get__`

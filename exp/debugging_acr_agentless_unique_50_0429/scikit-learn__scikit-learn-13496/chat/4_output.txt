To resolve the issue of exposing `warm_start` in `IsolationForest`, I need to review the source code of the `IsolationForest.__init__` method to determine where the changes should be made and ensure that `warm_start` is properly integrated into the parameters.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py", "IsolationForest.__init__")
```

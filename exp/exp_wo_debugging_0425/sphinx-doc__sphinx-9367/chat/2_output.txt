To correctly address the issue and generate the patch, I need to review the code responsible for converting or un-parsing the AST into a string, especially focusing on tuple handling. The `test_unparse` method in `tests/test_pycode_ast.py` suggests that the module utilizes the `ast.parse` functionality for parsing but does not explicitly show where the string rendering occurs.

The likely candidate for tuple parsing or rendering methods might be found in files related to Python AST handling or the Python domain implementation in Sphinx. However, I haven't retrieved any specific methods related to tuple parsing yet. Additionally, the `PythonDomain` class involves directives and methods that could be relevant.

To proceed, I will search for methods within the likely files that manage AST or tuple rendering. Let's start by looking for any methods within the `sphinx/util/pycode.py` that might handle parsing logic regarding tuple.

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/util/pycode.py", "unparse")
search_method_in_codebase("unparse")
search_method_in_codebase("pycode")
```

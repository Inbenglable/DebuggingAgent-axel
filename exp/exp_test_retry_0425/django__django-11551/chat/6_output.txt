### Patch Review

The patch modifies the `_check_list_display_item` method in the `django/contrib/admin/checks.py` file, as described in the issue. The change essentially:

- Removes the `hasattr(obj.model, item)` check which was incorrectly preventing further checks.
- Adds logic to attempt getting the field using `get_field`, and raises admin.E108 only if both `get_field` and `getattr` fail.
- Adds additional handling to check if the field is a `ManyToManyField` and raise an admin.E109 error if necessary.

### Output Analysis

**Original Output:**
The original output shows a `RuntimeError` stating that `Thing` doesn't declare an explicit app label and isn't in an application in `INSTALLED_APPS`. This indicates that the configuration setup for the test environment is missing an explicit app label for the `Thing` model. It does not necessarily point to the presence of bug admin.E108; instead, it indicates that the test environment wasn't set up correctly.

**Patched Output:**
After applying the patch, the same `RuntimeError` persists. This suggests that the patch did not address the environmental setup of Django applications in the test script, leading to the same failure as in the original test.

### Conclusion

The patch appears to correctly address the logic error in `_check_list_display_item` based on the issue's detailed explanation and expected checks. However, both the original and patched test outputs show a `RuntimeError` related to Django application setup, which prevents assessing whether admin.E108 error is resolved. The actual bug resolution cannot be verified due to issues in the test setup itself, rather than the patch.

Given the unchanged output relating to environment setup, and not the bug itself, and assuming the patch has been applied correctly, we can't definitively say the issue within the admin checks function has been resolved in terms of detected error.

Issue resolved: `False`

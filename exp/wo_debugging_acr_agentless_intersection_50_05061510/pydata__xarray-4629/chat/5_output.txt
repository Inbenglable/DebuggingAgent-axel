The issue at hand is that when merging datasets using `xarray.merge()` with `combine_attrs='override'`, the merged dataset's attributes should be independent of the source datasets. Specifically, changes made to the attributes of the merged dataset should not affect the original datasets' attributes.

### Analysis:

1. **Original Issue**: The test demonstrates that changing the attribute 'a' in the merged dataset (`xds3`) also changes it in the first dataset (`xds1`), indicating that `xds3` is incorrectly referencing `xds1`'s attributes instead of working with a copy.

2. **Patch**: The patch modifies the `merge_core` function in `xarray/core/merge.py` to create a new dictionary for each set of attributes during the merge process. Specifically, it uses `dict(var.attrs)` to ensure a new dictionary object is created, thereby preventing any unintended aliasing between the merged object and the original datasets.

3. **Test Output Before the Patch**: The test failed because the attribute 'a' in `xds1` was unexpectedly changed when `xds3.attrs['a']` was modified.

4. **Test Output After the Patch**: The test passes with no assertion errors, indicating that modifying `xds3.attrs['a']` no longer affects `xds1`.

The patch effectively resolves the issue by ensuring the attributes are not referenced from the first source, allowing the merged dataset's attributes to be modified independently.

### Conclusion:

Issue resolved: `True`

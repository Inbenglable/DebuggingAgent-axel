To resolve the issue, I need to investigate the source code responsible for generating migration files in Django, specifically focusing on `django.db.migrations.writer`. This is likely where the import handling is missing or not implemented correctly. 

I will first search for the class `MigrationWriter` in the Django codebase as this appears to be where migration file writing logic would reside. 

```python
search_class_in_codebase("MigrationWriter")
```

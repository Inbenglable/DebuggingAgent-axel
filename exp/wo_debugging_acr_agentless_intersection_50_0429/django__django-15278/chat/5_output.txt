To proceed with generating the patch, I need to understand how `add_field` is handled in the `SQLiteSchemaEditor`. This involves inspecting the `SQLiteSchemaEditor.add_field` method to see if there's a special case for unique constraints, particularly since it's known that adding a UNIQUE column directly is not allowed in SQLite.

Given the error and the process handled in `AddField.database_forwards`, gaining insight into the `SQLiteSchemaEditor` implementation is necessary.

I'll retrieve the `add_field` method in the `SQLiteSchemaEditor` class to evaluate how fields, particularly unique columns, are added under SQLite specifically.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("SQLiteSchemaEditor.add_field")
```

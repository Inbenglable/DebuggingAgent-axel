## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Formsets' add_fields() method fails in some circumstances if the argument index is None.
Description
	
Formsets' add_fields() method fails in some circumstances if the argument index is None.
When a FormSet has the attributes self.can_delete == True and self.can_delete_extra == False, calling the add_fields() method on that FormSet fails if the argument index is None. This occurs for example when calling FormSet.empty_form(). The result is that the method raises the exception TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'NoneType' and 'int'. 
Code example:
MyFormSet = forms.formset_factory(
	form=MyForm,
	can_delete=True,
	can_delete_extra=False,
)
my_formset = MyFormSet(
	initial=None,
)
print(my_formset.empty_form)
The reason this happens is that in in line 493 of [django.forms.formsets](â€‹https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/django/forms/formsets.py) index is compared to initial_form_count:
if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or index < initial_form_count):
Checking for index not None should fix the issue:
if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or (index is not None and index < initial_form_count)):
How to Reproduce
A self-contained example to reproduce this bug is as follows:
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os
import django
from django import forms
class MyForm(forms.Form):
	my_field = forms.CharField()
if __name__ == "__main__":
	settings_file = os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(__file__))[0]
	django.conf.settings.configure(
		DEBUG=True,
		MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES=[],
		ROOT_URLCONF=settings_file,
	)
	django.setup()
	MyFormSet = forms.formset_factory(
		form=MyForm,
		can_delete=True,
		can_delete_extra=False,
	)
	my_formset = MyFormSet(
		initial=None,
	)
	print(my_formset.empty_form)

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
I need to retrieve the source code for the `add_fields` method in the `django/forms/formsets.py` file to understand its functionality and generate the patch. This method seems to belong to a class, but the class name wasn't specified in the issue. To proceed, I'll first search for this method in its specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/forms/formsets.py", "add_fields")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_file("django/forms/formsets.py", "add_fields")
RESULT:
#### django/forms/formsets.py:BaseFormSet.add_fields
```python
    def add_fields(self, form, index):
        """A hook for adding extra fields on to each form instance."""
        initial_form_count = self.initial_form_count()
        if self.can_order:
            # Only pre-fill the ordering field for initial forms.
            if index is not None and index < initial_form_count:
                form.fields[ORDERING_FIELD_NAME] = IntegerField(
                    label=_("Order"),
                    initial=index + 1,
                    required=False,
                    widget=self.get_ordering_widget(),
                )
            else:
                form.fields[ORDERING_FIELD_NAME] = IntegerField(
                    label=_("Order"),
                    required=False,
                    widget=self.get_ordering_widget(),
                )
        if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or index < initial_form_count):
            form.fields[DELETION_FIELD_NAME] = BooleanField(
                label=_("Delete"),
                required=False,
                widget=self.get_deletion_widget(),
            )

```


==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

To resolve the issue, I need to examine the code of `Boolean.__eq__` and `Float.__eq__` methods to ensure that they handle comparisons correctly by addressing the mismatch when comparing S.false and S(0.0).

The source code for `Float.__eq__` has already been retrieved, but I need to examine `Boolean.__eq__`.

I'll search for the specific implementation of `Boolean.__eq__` in `sympy/logic/boolalg.py`.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/logic/boolalg.py", "Boolean.__eq__")
```

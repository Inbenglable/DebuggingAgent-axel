To resolve the issue of using `subprocess.run` and setting `PGPASSWORD` for the PostgreSQL backend client in Django, I need to retrieve the relevant source code for the `django.db.backends.postgres.client` method that handles subprocess creation. This will allow for understanding the current implementation and then refactoring it to use `subprocess.run`.

I'll use the appropriate search APIs to find and inspect the code. Since the specific file path isn't given, the search will begin from identifying the correct method in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("client")
search_code_in_codebase("django.db.backends.postgresql")
```

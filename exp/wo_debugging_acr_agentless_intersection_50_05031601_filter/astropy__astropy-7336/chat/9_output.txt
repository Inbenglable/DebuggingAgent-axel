I currently don't have the complete implementation of the `quantity_input` decorator. Since we aim to fix the handling of return type hints, especially for methods like `__init__` that naturally return `None`, we need to gather the full implementation of the `quantity_input` method to understand if and how it manages the return type annotations.

Let's proceed with retrieving the complete code for the `quantity_input` decorator to make sure we correctly address the issue.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("quantity_input")
```

Based on the information provided, I have obtained the source code for the `_rename` method of the `RenameContentType` class. 

The issue identified is that the `content_type.save()` method should be saving to a specific database, indicated by the `schema_editor.connection.alias`, but it currently is not explicitly doing so. The proposed fix is to modify the `content_type.save()` line to include the `using=db` argument, ensuring it saves to the correct database.

I have enough information to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

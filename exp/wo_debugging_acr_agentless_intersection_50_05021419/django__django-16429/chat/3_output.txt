To resolve the issue with the `timesince` function in Django, we need to ensure that the `pivot` datetime takes into account timezone information from the input datetime `d`. This involves adjusting the way the `pivot` datetime is created to ensure it matches the tzinfo of `d`.

Below is the patch in the SEARCH/REPLACE format:

```pythony
### django/utils/timesince.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        )
=======
            0,
            d.tzinfo,
        )
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Here's the edit represented in JSON format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/utils/timesince.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        )\n=======\n            0,\n            d.tzinfo,\n        )\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch ensures the `pivot` datetime is aware of the timezone, matching the timezone info from the original datetime `d`. This should resolve the TypeError when dealing with timezone-aware datetime objects in the `timesince()` function.

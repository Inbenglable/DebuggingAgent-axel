The issue lies in the `posify` function within the SymPy library, where the `finite` assumption (and potentially other assumptions) is not being preserved when a symbol is wrapped in a `Dummy` variable for positivity.

In the provided trace:
1. A symbol `x` with the `finite=True` assumption is created.
2. The `posify` function is called with this symbol, and it returns a new symbol `xp` without the `finite` assumption. This is evident as the assertion in line 23 fails because `xp._assumptions` does not contain the `finite` attribute.

The critical step to investigate further is the transformation within the `posify` method that results in assumptions being dropped or altered.

Observed method: `sympy/simplify/simplify.py:posify`

To address the gap identified in the issue, I need to explore how `_constraint_names` function identifies constraints, as it could be responsible for the miscount leading to the ValueError.

Let's retrieve the definition of `_constraint_names` to determine its process for identifying constraint names.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("_constraint_names")
```

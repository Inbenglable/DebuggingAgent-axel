To resolve the issue, we need to modify the implementation of the PostgreSQL client in Django's database backend, which likely involves the `client` method or similar function that handles executing PostgreSQL commands.

Since the initial search for the `client` method did not return the relevant code, I need to explicitly search for the `client` method within the Django PostgreSQL backend module.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("client")
```

Based on the information I've analyzed, the issue arises from using a float value for `min_samples` in the `OPTICS` class, which then results in an attempt to create a `NearestNeighbors` instance with a float value, leading to a `TypeError`.

The problem is within the `compute_optics_graph` function in the `sklearn/cluster/optics_.py` file. Specifically, the assignment of `min_samples` on lines 439 and 440:

```python
if min_samples <= 1:
    min_samples = max(2, min_samples * n_samples)
```

After this assignment, `min_samples` could be a float, which is problematic when passed to the `NearestNeighbors` class (line 448).

The proposed fix is to convert `min_samples` into an integer using rounding:

```python
if min_samples <= 1:
    min_samples = int(round(max(2, min_samples * n_samples)))
```

This fix ensures `min_samples` is always an integer when used as an argument in subsequent calls.

Buggy method: `sklearn/cluster/optics_.py:compute_optics_graph`

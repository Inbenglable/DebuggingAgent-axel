To fix this issue, I need to understand how headers are manipulated within the `Session` class, specifically focusing on how default headers are set and whether there's a mechanism to handle `None` values correctly. The methods of interest are likely `_update_header` and `prepare_request` as these may handle requests and headers. 

I need to retrieve the source code for both methods to learn more about their implementations.

```python
search_method_in_file("requests/sessions.py", "Session._update_header")
search_method_in_file("requests/sessions.py", "Session.prepare_request")
```

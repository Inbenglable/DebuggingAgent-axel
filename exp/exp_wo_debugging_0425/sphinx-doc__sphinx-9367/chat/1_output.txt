To address the issue, I need to understand how tuples are processed in the Sphinx project. This requires locating and analyzing the relevant code responsible for rendering tuples. Given the information provided in the issue, the file `tests/test_pycode_ast.py` appears to be the starting point for test cases related to this functionality. 

I'll search for the file and inspect how rendering is influenced by other parts of the codebase. Specifically, I need to ensure that I understand the environment in which the test case mentioned in the issue operates. Furthermore, there might be methods that directly handle tuple formatting. To do so, I need to find any related methods that could be linked to tuple presentation in Python code ASTs. Hence, I will use the search API to identify them.

```python
search_code_in_file("tests/test_pycode_ast.py", "(1,)")
search_method_in_file("sphinx/util/pycode.py", "parse_tuple")
search_method_in_codebase("parse_tuple")
search_class_in_codebase("ASTPythonPrinter")
search_class_in_codebase("PythonDomain")
```

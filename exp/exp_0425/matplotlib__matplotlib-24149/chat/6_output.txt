The issue in the matplotlib project is that the `ax.bar` function raises an exception when given input data consisting entirely of `NaN` values. The intended behavior is for the function to return a `BarCollection` with corresponding `NaN` values for the bar coordinates, as it did in version 3.6.0.

### Patch Review

The patch modifies the `_safe_first_finite` function to handle cases where all elements are non-finite by raising a `ValueError` with a descriptive message instead of causing an unhandled `StopIteration` exception:
```python
for val in obj:
    if safe_isfinite(val):
        return val
raise ValueError('No finite values found in the input.')
```

### Analysis of Test Output

**Original Test Output:**
- The function raises a `StopIteration` because it cannot find any finite values.

**Patched Test Output:**
- After applying the patch, the function now raises a `ValueError` with the message "No finite values found in the input."

### Conclusion

Although the patch improves error handling by raising a clear `ValueError`, it does not resolve the fundamental issue described in the bug report, which is that `ax.bar` should create a `BarCollection` despite receiving all-NaN data inputs. The desired functionality has not been restored; instead, a different error is now raised.

Therefore, the problem remains unresolved, and the output is not in line with the expected behavior mentioned in the issue description.

**Issue resolved:** `False`

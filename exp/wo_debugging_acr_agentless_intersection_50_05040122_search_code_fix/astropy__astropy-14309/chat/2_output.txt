Let's analyze the API returned content for `is_fits`:

1. **astropy/visualization/wcsaxes/wcsapi.py:107-113**
   - This snippet refers to a compatibility check involving `is_fits_wcs`, which seems to be a local variable related to FITS-WCS compatibility checks, rather than the `is_fits` function causing the issue. Not needed.

2. **astropy/nddata/ccddata.py:813-816**
   - This snippet shows the registration of the `is_fits` function as an identifier for the CCDData format with the registry. This is useful to understand how `is_fits` is wired into the registry. Required.

3. **astropy/nddata/tests/test_ccddata.py:606-612**
   - This snippet doesn't seem to refer to the `is_fits` function or related logic directly. Not needed.

4. **astropy/io/fits/connect.py:451-454**
   - This snippet demonstrates the registration of `is_fits` for the FITS format, which is directly relevant to the issue. Required.

5. **astropy/io/fits/tests/test_connect.py:1013-1016**
   - This snippet contains a regression test for `connect.is_fits` which might be helpful in identifying edge cases contributing to the bug. Required.

 The content that is relevant and needed for further analysis and to propose a fix are:

```
astropy/nddata/ccddata.py:813-816
astropy/io/fits/connect.py:451-454
astropy/io/fits/tests/test_connect.py:1013-1016
```

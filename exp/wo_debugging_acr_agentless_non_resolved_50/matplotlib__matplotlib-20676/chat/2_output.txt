To resolve the issue, I need to check the implementation of relevant methods within the `SpanSelector` class, specifically focusing on those that might influence the axis limits when `interactive=True`. This will help me understand where the axis limits might be getting extended to include 0.

Given that methods such as `_onmove`, `_release`, `_draw_shape`, and `extents` could potentially interact with the axis limits, I will retrieve their source code from `lib/matplotlib/widgets.py`.

```python
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/widgets.py", "SpanSelector._onmove")
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/widgets.py", "SpanSelector._release")
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/widgets.py", "SpanSelector._draw_shape")
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/widgets.py", "SpanSelector.extents")
```

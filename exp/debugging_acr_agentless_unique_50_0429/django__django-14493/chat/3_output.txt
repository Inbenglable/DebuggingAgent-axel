The error reported is an `UnboundLocalError` which occurs due to trying to use a variable `substitutions` that hasn't been initialized. The observed traceback provides enough context around where this error happens:

1. We see the traceback mentioning `django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py` line 251, where it attempts to evaluate `if substitutions:` without initializing `substitutions`.

2. The key location in the `ManifestFilesMixin.post_process` method shows a loop at line 256 iterating over `self._post_process`. If the loop isn't entered (which can happen with `max_post_process_passes = 0`), `substitutions` is never set, which leads to the error.

3. The issue arises because the context should include initializing `substitutions` to a default value (most likely an empty list or None) before the loop to prevent the error.

Given the nature of the error and the method we've been examining in `ManifestFilesMixin`, I can pinpoint the problematic area. It seems the `post_process` method in the `ManifestFilesMixin` class lacks initialization for `substitutions` prior to its usage outside the loop.

Therefore, we will identify the `ManifestFilesMixin.post_process` method in `storage.py` as the central point of this issue.

Buggy method: `django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py:ManifestFilesMixin.post_process`

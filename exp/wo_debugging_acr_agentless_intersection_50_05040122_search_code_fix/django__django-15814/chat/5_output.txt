Given that I need context around the `opts = cur_model._meta` snippet located in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, I must identify the method containing this snippet. Since repeated attempts to locate surrounding context have not yielded the name of the method, it's relevant to retrieve the larger code block or surrounding method explicitly to ensure the patch is applied correctly.

Let's initiate a search to capture the full method surrounding the identified problematic line.

```python
search_code_in_file("django/db/models/sql/query.py", "opts = cur_model._meta")
```

To resolve the issue of adding DISTINCT support for Avg and Sum aggregates in Django, we need to understand the current implementation of these aggregate classes to modify them for DISTINCT handling.

We have obtained class definitions for:

- `Avg`: `django/db/models/aggregates.py`
- `Sum`: `django/db/models/aggregates.py`
- `Min`: `django/db/models/aggregates.py`
- `Max`: `django/db/models/aggregates.py`

To make these modifications, we should examine the complete implementation of each of these classes within the file `django/db/models/aggregates.py`. Let's first retrieve these class definitions fully.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Avg")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Sum")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Min")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Max")
```

In order to resolve the issue, I need to understand how the `urlize()` function is currently implemented in the Django project. Therefore, I'll need to retrieve its source code.

Since the issue pertains specifically to the `urlize` function, and I don't have information about the file where this function is defined, I will need to search for the method in the project codebase.

I'll proceed with the necessary API call to locate the `urlize` function within the Django codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("urlize")
```

You are a PR reviewer that needs to review the patch generated by a bug repair agent and determine whether the issue is fixed or not.
This is the bug issue, which is in the **astropy** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
InheritDocstrings metaclass doesn't work for properties
Inside the InheritDocstrings metaclass it uses `inspect.isfunction` which returns `False` for properties.

</ISSUE>


Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
## REPRODUCE TEST
```
import inspect
import traceback
import sys
from astropy.utils.misc import InheritDocstrings

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

class Base(metaclass=InheritDocstrings):
    def method(self):
        """This is the method docstring."""
        pass

    @property
    def prop(self):
        """This is the property docstring."""
        return 42

class Derived(Base):
    def method(self):
        pass

    @property
    def prop(self):
        pass

def main():
    # Check if the method docstring is inherited
    assert Derived.method.__doc__ == "This is the method docstring.", "Method docstring not inherited."

    # Check if the property docstring is inherited
    try:
        assert Derived.prop.__doc__ == "This is the property docstring.", "Property docstring not inherited."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

And this is the original output when running the test (before applying the patch):
## ORIGINAL OUTPUT

The repair agent has tried to generate a patch to fix the issue:
## PATCH CONTEXT
<PATCH_CONTEXT>
To address the issue where the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass in the Astropy project does not inherit docstrings for properties, we need to adjust the logic in its `__init__` method. Specifically, we need to extend the existing functionality, which currently handles only functions, to also accommodate properties.

Here's the change that should be made to the `__init__` method in `astropy/utils/misc.py`:

```pythony
### astropy/utils/misc.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            if (inspect.isfunction(val) and
                is_public_member(key) and
                val.__doc__ is None):
                for base in cls.__mro__[1:]:
                    super_method = getattr(base, key, None)
                    if super_method is not None:
                        val.__doc__ = super_method.__doc__
                        break
=======
            if is_public_member(key) and val.__doc__ is None:
                if inspect.isfunction(val) or isinstance(val, property):
                    for base in cls.__mro__[1:]:
                        super_method = getattr(base, key, None)
                        if super_method is not None:
                            if isinstance(val, property) and isinstance(super_method, property):
                                val = val.setter(super_method.fset)
                                val = val.deleter(super_method.fdel)
                            val.__doc__ = super_method.__doc__
                            break
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This patch introduces several modifications:
- It checks if the attribute is either a function or a property.
- It includes logic to handle docstring inheritance for property objects by creating property setters and deleters accordingly.

Let's output the modification as a JSON result:

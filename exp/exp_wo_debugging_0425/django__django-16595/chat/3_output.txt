To address the issue, I need to modify the `reduce` method of the `AlterField` class to handle the optimization of consecutive `AlterField` operations. I have already located the `reduce` method, and it is now necessary to make modifications to it to account for situations where an operation is another `AlterField`.

To proceed, I'll need to gather the full implementation of the `reduce` method from `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` to ensure that any adjustments integrate seamlessly with current logic. I've already retrieved the `reduce` method, but I should also look at the context of how `reduce` works with its `super` methods. For this purpose, I'll retrieve the `FieldOperation.reduce` method from its respective class to better understand inherited behavior.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/operations/base.py", "FieldOperation.reduce")
```

Based on the provided code snippets for the `as_sql` methods in both `TruncDate` and `TruncTime`, the current implementation issues revolve around the use of `get_current_timezone_name()` unconditionally instead of utilizing the provided `tzinfo` parameter. 

To resolve the issue, we need to modify these methods to accept and use the `tzinfo` parameter. However, before proceeding to make the modifications, I want to ensure that I understand how the `tzinfo` parameter is intended to be received and stored within the `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` classes, if at all. This will guide how any refactoring should be applied, ensuring consistency with the overall design.

I'll check if `tzinfo` is referenced elsewhere within these classes or their parent classes `TruncBase`. Given that `TruncBase` includes the TimeZone mixin, it's also worth examining how `tzinfo` handling is implemented there. Here's a search to gather more context:

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncBase")
```

Once the relevant context is retrieved, I'll confirm whether we're ready to generate a patch and make the necessary updates to these functions.

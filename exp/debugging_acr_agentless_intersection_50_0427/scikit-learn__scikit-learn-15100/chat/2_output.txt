To address the issue with the `strip_accents_unicode` method, I need to review the existing implementation of the method within the file to identify the exact logic that requires adjustment. Thus, I will search for the method in the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py", "strip_accents_unicode")
```

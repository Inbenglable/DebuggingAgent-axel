To evaluate whether the issue is resolved, let's examine both the patch provided and the test output before and after applying the patch.

### Patch Analysis:
The patch modifies the `__str__` method in the `Columns` class within the file `django/db/backends/ddl_references.py`. The change ensures that there's a proper whitespace handling when adding column suffixes. Specifically, the substitution in the existing code is:

**Original Code:**
```python
return self.quote_name(column) + self.col_suffixes[idx]
```

**Patched Code:**
```python
return self.quote_name(column) + (' ' + self.col_suffixes[idx] if self.col_suffixes[idx] else '')
```

This patch correctly handles empty suffix strings by ensuring that a space is added only when a suffix is non-empty, which should address the whitespace issue.

### Test Output Analysis:
- **Before and After Patch:** Both outputs show the error `ModuleNotFoundError`. This error indicates a problem with the attempted import of `AddIndex` from `django.db.migrations.operations.indexes`. 

The error is unrelated to the patch itself. It suggests that maybe the structure of the reproduction test is incorrect or outdated, particularly regarding the import path for `AddIndex`. Since this error prevents the test from running, we cannot conclude if the patch fixed the whitespace issue because the test did not execute.

### Conclusion:
Since the test fails to run due to a module import error unrelated to the patch, we cannot determine whether the whitespace issue is resolved based on the provided information. The issue with module import needs resolving before the patch can be validated through the test.

Issue resolved: `False`

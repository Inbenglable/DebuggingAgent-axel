To determine whether the issue is resolved, we need to consider both the content of the patch and the test output before and after applying the patch:

### Patch Review:
The proposed patch modifies the `SQLCompiler.get_group_by` method in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` to ensure that fields from `Meta.ordering` are not erroneously included in the `GROUP BY` clause alongside other order_by expressions. 

The patch introduces the following logic:
- Identifies `Meta.ordering` fields and skips adding these fields to the `GROUP BY` clause.
  
The intention of the patch is correct as it creates a filter for `Meta.ordering`, which aligns with the objective of the issue reported.

### Analysis of Test Outputs:
- **Original Output and Test Setup Issues**: 
  The tests failed not due to the issue itself but because of incorrect test environment setup. The error message shows a `RuntimeError` that indicates `setup_test_environment()` was called repetitively without calling `teardown_test_environment()`. This error is related to the test setup rather than the logic of aggregation or query handling in Django ORM.

- **Patched Output**:
  The output after the patch remains unchanged from the original output. The test still fails due to the same `setup_test_environment()` error. This suggests the changes in logic to handle the `GROUP BY` were not executed or assessed due to this persistent initialization error.

### Conclusion:
The test did not reach the logic that would have triggered a query exception due to flawed test setup; thus, we cannot conclusively verify the patch correctness regarding the initial issue about `GROUP BY` aggregation. As the test was unable to run to completion due to environment setup issues, the effectiveness of patch changes cannot be verified with the current data.

**Issue resolved**: `False`

Neither before nor after applying the patch led to a meaningful conclusion due to test setup issues. Further corrections in the test setup are necessary to properly evaluate whether the patch addresses the core issue.

To resolve the issue, I need to inspect the current implementation of the `__eq__` method within the `Float` class in the specified file `sympy/core/numbers.py`. This will help determine what adjustments are necessary to fix the asymmetric behavior during comparison.

Let's retrieve the source code for the `Float.__eq__` method.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/core/numbers.py", "Float.__eq__")
```

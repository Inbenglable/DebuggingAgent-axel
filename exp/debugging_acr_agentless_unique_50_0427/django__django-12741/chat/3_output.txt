From the provided analysis and runtime information, we've identified that the issue lies within the `execute_sql_flush` method in `django/db/backends/base/operations.py`, specifically within lines 403 to 408.

The abnormal program behavior indicates a `TypeError` due to the mismatch between the expected and provided method signature. The test attempts to call `connection.ops.execute_sql_flush(sql_list)`, which implies the method should take only one parameter (the SQL list), not two (`using` and `sql_list`).

Analyzing this context, the `using` argument is redundant because `self.connection.alias` can be used to determine the database alias instead. 

This signals that the `execute_sql_flush` method has a code segment that needs modification to remove `using` and utilize `self.connection.alias` instead. Let's focus on the lines that use `using` and change them accordingly.

Thus, the likely buggy method is the one we're observing due to its direct involvement with this issue description, and we can proceed to fix this without deeper observation:

Buggy method: `django/db/backends/base/operations.py:BaseDatabaseOperations.execute_sql_flush`

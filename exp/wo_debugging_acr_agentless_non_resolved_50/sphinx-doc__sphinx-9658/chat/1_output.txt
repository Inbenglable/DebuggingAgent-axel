To address the issue of incorrect documentation in the Sphinx project, I need to investigate how Sphinx generates the "Bases" section for classes. Specifically, I need to check where in the Sphinx source code the class hierarchies are resolved and how they're formatted for documentation. This requires looking into the autodoc module of Sphinx, as it is responsible for extracting documentation from Python modules.

I will search for the relevant code in the Sphinx project, particularly how the base classes of a documented class are resolved and formatted. This will involve locating the code handling class documentation in Sphinx, especially regarding handling mocked modules or classes.

Let's start by searching for methods in the Sphinx codebase that handle class documentation generation.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("get_class_bases")
search_method_in_codebase("format_class_signature")
search_method_in_codebase("add_line")
search_method_in_codebase("documenters.ClassDocumenter")
```

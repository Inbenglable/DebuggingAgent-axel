To resolve the issue, we need to make modifications in the `display_for_field` function in `django/contrib/admin/utils.py` to properly handle `JSONField` when readonly. We've already retrieved the source code for `display_for_field`. Now we need the implementation of `prepare_value` method from the JSONField to ensure we're using the correct approach.

I will now retrieve the source code for the `prepare_value` method in the `django/db/models/fields/json.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/fields/json.py", "prepare_value")
```

The issue identified is that the `resolve_lookup_value` method coerces lists into tuples. To address this, we need to modify the method so it retains the input type of iterable values. I already have the source code for the `resolve_lookup_value` method from `django/db/models/sql/query.py`. With this information, I am ready to generate a patch.

Ready generation: `True`

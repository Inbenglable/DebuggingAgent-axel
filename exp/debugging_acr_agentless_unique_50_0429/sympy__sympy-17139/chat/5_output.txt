Let's analyze the current observed code and abnormal program behavior.

We're observing the code around line 504 in the `sympy/simplify/fu.py` file:

```python
501: if not (rv.is_Pow and rv.base.func == f):
502:     return rv

504: if (rv.exp < 0) == True:
505:     return rv
506: if (rv.exp > max) == True:
```

The error arises from the line attempting to compare `rv.exp`, which may be a complex number, with integers using `<` and `>`. Complex numbers in Python cannot be ordered, so trying comparisons like these yields a `TypeError`.

Both lines 504 and 506 have conditionals that involve `rv.exp`, which risks involving a complex number (`I` in the example provided: `cos(x)**I`).

The first error observed, `NameError: name 'I' is not defined` during testing, is separate and merely indicates that `I` wasn't imported from `sympy` in the test script, which is a test setup issue. The real issue within the Sympy library, now understood from the `TypeError`, is a logic problem where illegal comparisons on potentially complex expressions are made.

#### Plan

To correctly address this issue:
1. Avoid illegal comparison operations on complex numbers in the problematic method.

Next, I will observe the method `TR6` since it directly calls `_TR56`, where these faulty checks occur.

```python
Observed method: sympy/simplify/fu.py:TR6
```

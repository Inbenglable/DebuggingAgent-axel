To resolve the issue with `KMeans` giving different results depending on the `n_jobs` parameter, it's necessary to understand the implementation of the `KMeans` class, as well as the fit method, because this method executes the core logic of KMeans, including how it handles parallel processing. This can help identify the source of the discrepancy.

Therefore, I will search for the implementation of the `KMeans` class and its `fit` method in the scikit-learn codebase to better understand the cause of the issue.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("KMeans")
search_method_in_codebase("KMeans.fit")
```

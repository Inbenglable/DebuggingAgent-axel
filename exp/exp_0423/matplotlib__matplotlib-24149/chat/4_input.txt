#### ISSUE
[Bug]: ax.bar raises for all-nan data on matplotlib 3.6.1 
### Bug summary

`ax.bar` raises an exception in 3.6.1 when passed only nan data. This irrevocably breaks seaborn's histogram function (which draws and then removes a "phantom" bar to trip the color cycle).

### Code for reproduction

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
f, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.bar([np.nan], [np.nan])
```


### Actual outcome

```python-traceback
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
StopIteration                             Traceback (most recent call last)

   2180     # wrap numpy arrays.

   2183     except (TypeError, IndexError, KeyError):
   2184         pass

   1747                        "support generators as input")
   1748 else:
-> 1749     return next(val for val in obj if safe_isfinite(val))

StopIteration: 
```

### Expected outcome

On 3.6.0 this returns a `BarCollection` with one Rectangle, having `nan` for `x` and `height`.

### Additional information

I assume it's related to this bullet in the release notes:

- Fix barplot being empty when first element is NaN

But I don't know the context for it to investigate further (could these link to PRs?)

Further debugging:

```python
ax.bar([np.nan], [0])  # Raises
ax.bar([0], [np.nan])  # Works
```

So it's about the x position specifically.

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
Based on the traceback and the description of the bug, it looks like the issue is occurring within the `Axes.bar` method when it encounters data that contains only NaN values. The traceback indicates that the problem arises from the `_safe_first_finite` function, which is called from within the `_convert_dx` method of the `Axes` class.

The key part of the traceback is:

```
File ~/miniconda/envs/py310/lib/python3.10/site-packages/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py:2182, in Axes._convert_dx
    2182 x0 = cbook._safe_first_finite(x0)
```

Since this function is attempting to find the first finite value from the input data, and because the input in this case is entirely NaN, a `StopIteration` exception is raised. This indicates that the method `_safe_first_finite` does not handle the case of inputs that are entirely NaN.

Given this information, the next step is to trace into the `_safe_first_finite` function to understand why it does not handle completely NaN arrays, which ultimately leads to the `StopIteration` error.

Observed method: `lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py:_safe_first_finite`
==================================================
The issue at hand arises from the `_safe_first_finite` function in `matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py`. This function is tasked with returning the first finite (or non-None if configured) value in an iterable object. In the case presented, the iterable contains only NaN values. As a result, the function raises a `StopIteration` exception because it does not find any finite values to return.

The traceback indicates that this exception is not caught elsewhere, leading to a failure when using `ax.bar` with NaN data.

### Analysis of Observed Code:

- **Functionality:** 
  - The `_safe_first_finite` function attempts to iterate through `obj` and return the first finite element determined by `np.isfinite`.

- **Current Observation:**
  - When `obj` contains only NaN values, the iteration in the `next(val for val in obj if safe_isfinite(val))` line fails to yield any finite value.
  - This results in a `StopIteration` exception, which isn't handled, causing the overall function/process to fail.

Given your goal to resolve this issue, it seems appropriate to modify the `_safe_first_finite` function to handle cases where no finite element is found, perhaps returning a default value or implementing a check/warning.

### Bug Location:

Considering the observations so far, the root of the issue is in the `_safe_first_finite` function failing to handle all-NaN data appropriately.

Buggy method: `lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py:_safe_first_finite`

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

### IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

### IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

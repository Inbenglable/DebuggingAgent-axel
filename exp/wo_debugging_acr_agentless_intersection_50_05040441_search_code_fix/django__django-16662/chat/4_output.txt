To address the issue of migration import ordering, I need to identify the exact method or class in Django's codebase responsible for generating these migration files. I will start by searching for methods related to migration generation, especially focusing on anything that constructs or outputs the migration file. The previous search provided information on the `Migration` class, but I need more specifics about how the import statements are handled or generated within the migration files.

Thus, I will proceed to search for relevant methods that might directly handle migration file generation or importing.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("write_migration")
search_method_in_codebase("write")
search_method_in_codebase("write_imports")
search_method_in_codebase("writer")
```

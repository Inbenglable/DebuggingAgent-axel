First, I need to investigate the source code of the `subs` method to understand how the substitution is handled in the context of expressions involving `Piecewise` and trigonometric/hyperbolic functions like `sinh`. Since the issue mentions an error with `PolynomialError`, I should also investigate how `Piecewise` and polynomial checking is handled.

Let's start by finding the files involved with substitution, `sinh` (or similar functions), and `Piecewise`, and examine their code.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("subs")
search_class_in_codebase("Piecewise")
search_method_in_codebase("sinh")
search_method_in_codebase("PolynomialError")
```

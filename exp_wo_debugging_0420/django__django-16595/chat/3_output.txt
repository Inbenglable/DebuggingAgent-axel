To resolve the issue, we need to modify the `AlterField.reduce` method to optimize multiple `AlterField` operations consecutively.

To generate this patch, we'll need to retrieve the source code for the `reduce` method from the `AlterField` class, which is located in the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py", "AlterField.reduce")
```

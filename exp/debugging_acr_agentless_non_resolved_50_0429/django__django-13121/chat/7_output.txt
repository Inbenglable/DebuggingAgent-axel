To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve additional code related to the `convert_durationfield_value` method, particularly focusing on how durations are managed and converted between MySQL and SQLite databases. Let's check out the relevant definitions in `SQLiteDatabaseOperations` and `MySQLDatabaseOperations`.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/mysql/base.py", "MySQLDatabaseOperations.convert_durationfield_value")
search_code_in_file("django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py", "SQLiteDatabaseOperations")
search_code_in_file("django/db/backends/mysql/base.py", "MySQLDatabaseOperations")
```

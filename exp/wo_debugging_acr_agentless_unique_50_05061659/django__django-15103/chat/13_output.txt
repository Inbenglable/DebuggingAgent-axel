To review whether the issue is fixed or not, let's analyze the provided test outputs and the patch:

### Patch Analysis
The patch modifies the `json_script` function in `django/utils/html.py` to make the `element_id` argument optional. It uses default arguments (`element_id=None`) and adjusts the script tag based on the presence of `element_id`.

### Test Outputs Analysis

#### Original Output
The test fails with a `TemplateSyntaxError` stating that `'django.core.templatetags.json_script' is not a registered tag library`. This indicates a problem unrelated to the functionality of making `element_id` optionalâ€”it's about the registration of the tag library.

#### Patched Output
After applying the patch, the exact same `TemplateSyntaxError` occurs. This suggests that the patch did not address the main issue causing the failure, which is the registration of the tag library, not the optionality of `element_id`.

### Conclusion
The main issue highlighted by the test output is the unregistered tag library `'django.core.templatetags.json_script'`. Since this error persists despite the patch, it suggests that the patch does not resolve the underlying problem that prevents the test from running successfully.

Therefore:

Issue resolved: `False`

The `UnifiedReadWriteMethod.__get__` method seems to be a straightforward method designed to access the `fget` attribute. Given that this method does not directly manipulate formats or handle HTML outputs, it is unlikely to directly cause the issue described.

The error message indicates that the `formats` parameter is ignored when writing tables to HTML format. Therefore, it would make sense to observe the part of the code responsible for handling the 'write' operation, particularly in the context of HTML.

There is no direct indication that the `__get__` method would impact the application of formats in HTML outputs, so let's explore where the actual writing process happens in the Astropy library, specifically looking for where formats are applied in the context of writing tables in HTML format.

To locate the root cause, we need to check the specific code responsible for writing tables in HTML format within the Astropy project.

Observed scope: `astropy/io/ascii/html.py:{METHOD_START}-{METHOD_END}`

(Here `{METHOD_START}` and `{METHOD_END}` would be replaced with the actual line numbers of the method implementing HTML table writing). Let's see the deeper downstream run-time information for this scope.

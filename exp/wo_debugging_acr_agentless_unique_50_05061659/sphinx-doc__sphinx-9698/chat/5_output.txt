To address the issue, I need to modify how properties are handled in the index entries. Specifically, since I have the `handle_signature` method implementations, the next step is to identify where parens are added to index entries for the `py:method` directive when the `:property:` option is used.

I need to further investigate where the function or logic responsible for generating index entries for `py:method` with `:property:` is located, and how it currently handles the addition of parens.

I'll now search in the "sphinx/domains/python.py" file to gain further insight into how the `py:method` directive handles properties, especially focusing on indexing logic.

```python
search_code_in_file("sphinx/domains/python.py", "indexnode['entries'].append")
search_code_in_file("sphinx/domains/python.py", "entries.append")
```

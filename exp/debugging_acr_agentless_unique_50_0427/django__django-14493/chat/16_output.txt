To resolve the issue of `substitutions` being referenced before assignment, we should ensure that the `substitutions` variable is initialized before it is potentially referenced in the `post_process` method. Here's how the patch can be designed in `SEARCH/REPLACE` format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            yield from super().post_process(*args, **kwargs)\n=======\n        substitutions = []\n        yield from super().post_process(*args, **kwargs)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch ensures that `substitutions` is initialized as an empty list before any logic that might involve manipulating or checking it, thus preventing the `UnboundLocalError`.

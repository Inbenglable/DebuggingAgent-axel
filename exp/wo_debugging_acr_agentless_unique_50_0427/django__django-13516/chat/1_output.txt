Based on the issue described, the primary concern is that `flush()` doesn't work properly when standard output or error is handled in management commands, specifically during migrations. This would likely involve inspecting the source code for the migrate command and how it handles output flushing.

I will need to retrieve the source code related to the migrate management command and inspect how flushing is handled. This typically involves looking at the code where the stdout and stderr are managed in the `migrate` command, which could be found in Django's management commands directory.

I will search for the `migrate` command method to analyze how it performs operations and manages stdout/stderr flushing.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("migrate")
```

To determine if the issue is resolved, let's first consider the patch and its intended effect. The patch simply initializes the `substitutions` variable to an empty list before it is used. This change is meant to prevent the `UnboundLocalError` from occurring when `max_post_process_passes` is set to 0 and the loop (where `substitutions` would otherwise be defined) is not entered.

### Patch Analysis:
- **Patch Details**: The patch adds `substitutions = []` before the `yield from super().post_process(*args, **kwargs)`. This ensures that `substitutions` is defined, avoiding an `UnboundLocalError`.
  
### Test Output Analysis:

1. **Original Output:** 
   - The error indicates an `UnboundLocalError` due to `substitutions` being referenced before assignment. This is consistent with the original issue description.

2. **Patched Output:** 
   - The output reveals the same error regarding `AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet.` as in the original output.

### Conclusion:
The `UnboundLocalError` appears not to have manifested in the patched output because the test is failing due to a different issue (`AppRegistryNotReady`) before it even reaches the point where `substitutions` would be used. The `AppRegistryNotReady` error needs to be resolved in the test setup before we can verify whether the patch fixes the `UnboundLocalError`.

Therefore, based solely on the provided output, we cannot yet determine if the specific `UnboundLocalError` issue with `substitutions` is fixed, as the test fails at an earlier stage.

Issue resolved: `False`

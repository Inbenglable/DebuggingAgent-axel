The `Expr.__eq__` method from the `sympy/core/expr.py` file provides a detailed mechanism for comparing symbolic expressions, including handling numbers and special cases through `_sympify`. However, to address the issue, I also need to investigate the specific implementation for symbolic booleans that might affect the way `S.false` objects are compared against numbers and other expressions. 

To proceed, I need to locate the implementation of `S.false` within the sympy codebase concerning symbolic boolean logic to ensure the comparison logic is correctly applied. Let's search for `S.false` in the codebase and identify where its logical operations are defined.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("S")
search_class_in_codebase("Boolean")
search_method_in_codebase("Boolean.__eq__")
```

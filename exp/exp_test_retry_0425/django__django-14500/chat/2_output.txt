Based on the information provided, the main issue encountered during the test execution is that the script fails to create the appropriate squashed migration and then subsequently fails to unapply the squashed migration. The error message "Cannot find a migration matching '0002' from app 'test_app'" suggests that the migration process may not have executed as expected, particularly during the squashing of migrations.

The error appears to occur when attempting the `call_command('squashmigrations', 'test_app', '0001', '0002')` step, since the error indicates that migration '0002' could not be found. This suggests that the migration '0002' might not have been created successfully or is not recognized in the test environment.

Given that we have been following the steps sequentially and the issue seems to relate to migration handling, particularly the squashing and recognition of migration files, the next logical step is to inspect how migrations are being squashed and applied. To proceed, let's observe the method responsible for squashing migrations, as this seems to be where the process is failing.

Observed method: `django/core/management/commands/squashmigrations.py:Command.handle`

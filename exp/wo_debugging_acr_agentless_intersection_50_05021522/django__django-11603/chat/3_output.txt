To add DISTINCT support for the Avg, Sum, Min, and Max aggregates, I need to inspect the `Aggregate` class implementation to understand how DISTINCT is handled and see if there's an existing mechanism for this. The classes Avg, Sum, Min, and Max extend `Aggregate`, so the capability to allow DISTINCT might be defined at a higher level. 

Let me retrieve the code for the `Aggregate` class to determine the changes needed to enable DISTINCT support for these aggregates.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Aggregate")
```

Here is the patch to address the issue by modifying the `_print_Add` method to correctly identify and print subtractions in matrix expressions:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/printing/str.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            if t.startswith('-'):\n                sign = \"-\"\n                t = t[1:]\n            else:\n                sign = \"+\"\n=======\n            if term.is_Mul and term.args[0] == -1:\n                sign = \"-\"\n                t = self._print(term.args[1])\n            else:\n                sign = \"+\"\n                if t.startswith('-'):\n                    t = t[1:]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

The patch adjusts the `_print_Add` method to specifically handle terms that are parts of multiplication expressions where the first argument is `-1`, treating these as explicit subtraction terms and printing them with a `-` sign, thus reflecting natural subtraction syntax in the output. This patch ensures expressions involving matrix subtractions are printed as intended without altering their internal mathematical representation.

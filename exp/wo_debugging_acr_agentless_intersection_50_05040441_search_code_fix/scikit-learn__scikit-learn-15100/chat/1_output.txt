To resolve the issue with the `strip_accents_unicode` function, I need to retrieve the source code of this function to understand its current implementation and identify where the changes can be applied to handle strings already in NFKD form. Since the issue directly mentions the `strip_accents_unicode` method, I will search for its code in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("strip_accents_unicode")
```

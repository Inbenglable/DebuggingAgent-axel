To address the issue, I need to modify the method in `django.db.backends.postgres.client` where subprocesses are run. I will need to check the Postgres client implementation to locate the correct method and understand how it's currently handling subprocess execution. Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code associated with the relevant method.

Given that I don't know the exact file path of the client class within the Postgres backend, I will search for the relevant method in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("client")
```

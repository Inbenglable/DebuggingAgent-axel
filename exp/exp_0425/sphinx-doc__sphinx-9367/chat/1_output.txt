To resolve the issue, we need to trace the program behavior step-by-step and observe where the expected behavior diverges from the actual behavior.

### Analysis of Observed Behavior

1. **Expected Behavior**:
   - The input tuple `(1,)` should be unparsed to `(1,)`, with the trailing comma preserved.

2. **Current Observed Behavior**:
   - The input tuple `(1,)` is unparsed to `(1)`, losing the trailing comma.

3. **Debugging Steps So Far**:
   - The code uses `ast.unparse(module.body[0].value, source)` to unparse the AST node back to source code.
   - The `unparse` function in `sphinx/pycode/ast.py` is returning the output without the comma: `(1)`.

### Current Abnormal Behavior Trace
- The abnormal behavior appears when `ast.unparse(module.body[0].value, source)` is invoked, indicating that the issue lies within how the AST node is unparsed back to the source code, likely in handling tuples.

### Next Step
Since the issue lies in the unparse process not adding the trailing comma for a single-element tuple, we should proceed to trace the `unparse` method call to find how tuples are processed.

Observed method: `sphinx/pycode/ast.py:unparse`

To address the issue with `kahane_simplify` function where it incorrectly reverses the order of leading uncontracted gamma matrices, we need to adjust the insertion process of leading matrices.

The fix involves correcting the order in which the uncontracted gamma matrices are reinserted into the expression.

Let's create a patch to resolve this:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/physics/hep/gamma_matrices.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    for i in range(0, first_dum_pos):\n        [ri.insert(0, free_pos[i]) for ri in resulting_indices]\n=======\n    for i in range(first_dum_pos - 1, -1, -1):\n        [ri.insert(0, free_pos[i]) for ri in resulting_indices]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch ensures that the leading non-contracted gamma matrices are inserted back at the start of the product in the correct order. The iteration direction is reversed to properly maintain the original order.

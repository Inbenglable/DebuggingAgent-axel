To address the issue, I need to adjust the handling of the 'to' field in the `only_relation_agnostic_fields` method within the `MigrationAutodetector` class. I need to retrieve the source code of this method in order to implement the recommended change, which is to replace `del deconstruction[2]['to']` with `deconstruction[2].pop('to', None)`.

Let's search for this method in the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/autodetector.py", "MigrationAutodetector.only_relation_agnostic_fields")
```

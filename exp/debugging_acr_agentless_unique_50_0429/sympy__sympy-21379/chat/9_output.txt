Based on the provided information and analysis, the error arises from the handling of expressions inside the `_parallel_poly_from_expr` method in `sympy/polys/polytools.py`. The root cause of the problem seems to be the attempt to treat or interpret a `Piecewise` construct as a polynomial, which is conceptually inappropriate. This specific problem emerges because of the presence of `Piecewise` terms in the generators that lead to this particular `PolynomialError`.

The method `_parallel_poly_from_expr` is responsible for constructing polynomials from expressions. In this context, it raises a `PolynomialError` when it encounters `Piecewise` generators, evident from:

```python
if isinstance(k, Piecewise):
    raise PolynomialError("Piecewise generators do not make sense")
```

This suggests that the issue arises when the method `sympify` results in an expression where `Piecewise` constructs end up being treated as polynomial generators.

Given the detailed step-by-step execution trace and understanding of the `_parallel_poly_from_expr` function, we now have enough information to conclude that the handling of `Piecewise` should be evaluated or bypassed in a manner that doesn't lead to polynomial interpretation.

Thus, the buggy method and problematic line have been identified:

Buggy method: `sympy/polys/polytools.py:_parallel_poly_from_expr`
Buggy code: 
```python
if isinstance(k, Piecewise):
    raise PolynomialError("Piecewise generators do not make sense")
```

The fix would involve ensuring that substitutions do not cause `Piecewise` constructs to be part of the generators passed into polynomial expressions. The rehab might involve changing how `Piecewise` expressions are handled when real assumptions are set or adjusting substitution mechanisms to prevent such scenarios.

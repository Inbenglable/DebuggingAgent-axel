The issue is not fixed according to the patched output, which is identical to the original output. There is an `AssertionError` which states that "Non-form errors do not have the 'nonform' CSS class."

Reviewing the patch context, the patch was intended to add a property `is_nonform` to the `ErrorList` instance for non-form errors. This property should signify that the 'nonform' CSS class is necessary. However, the test output shows that the intended changes within the patch did not achieve the required behavior, as the test still does not find the 'nonform' CSS class in the non-form errors.

Therefore, the issue has not been resolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

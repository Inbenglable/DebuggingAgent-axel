To resolve the issue, I need to adjust the logic in the `combine_by_coords` function to ignore non-monotonic checks on identical coordinates which, according to the documentation, should be ignored.

Here is the patch that handles this:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### xarray/core/combine.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nfor dim in concatenated.dims:\n    if dim in concatenated:\n=======\nfor dim in concatenated.dims:\n    if dim in concatenated and not all(concatenated[dim].equals(ds[dim]) for ds in datasets):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This change introduces a condition to check if all datasets have identical coordinates for the given dimension. If they do, the monotonicity check is bypassed for that dimension.

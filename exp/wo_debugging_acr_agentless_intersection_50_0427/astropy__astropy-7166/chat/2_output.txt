To resolve the issue, I need to understand how the `__init__` method of the `InheritDocstrings` class is implemented, as this is likely where the problem lies regarding the handling of properties. Therefore, I will search for the source code of the `__init__` method in the `InheritDocstrings` class located in `astropy/utils/misc.py`.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/utils/misc.py", "InheritDocstrings.__init__")
```

To address the issue, we need to inspect the `get_child_arguments` method in the Django codebase, as the request is to modify how this method detects if Python was launched with `-m`. Since we don't have the file path for this method, the first step would be to search for `get_child_arguments` in the entire Django codebase to locate its source code.

Let's proceed with retrieving the source code for the `get_child_arguments` method.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("get_child_arguments")
```

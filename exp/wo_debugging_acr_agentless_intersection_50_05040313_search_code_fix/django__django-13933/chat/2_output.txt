To address the issue, I need to retrieve the `to_python` and `validate` methods inside `ModelChoiceField`, as these methods typically handle the conversion and validation of field data, and we need to modify the validation error message to include the invalid choice value. 

Let's proceed with obtaining their source code.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/forms/models.py", "ModelChoiceField.to_python")
search_method_in_file("django/forms/models.py", "ModelChoiceField.validate")
```

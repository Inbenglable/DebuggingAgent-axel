To resolve the issue and generate the patch, I need to ensure that the `URLValidator.__call__` method strips forbidden characters (LF, CR, and tabs) from the URL before processing it further. From the information provided, we have already retrieved the source code of this method. Thus, I am ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

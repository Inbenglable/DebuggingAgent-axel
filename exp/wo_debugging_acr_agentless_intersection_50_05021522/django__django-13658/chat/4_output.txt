To address the issue, I need to examine the `__init__` method within the `ManagementUtility` class and any portion of the code where `CommandParser` is instantiated. This will help me understand how to correctly amend the instantiation of `CommandParser` with the `prog=self.prog_name` parameter.

Since I currently only have the file location and not the method details, I will retrieve the details of the `__init__` method in the `ManagementUtility` class in the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/management/__init__.py", "ManagementUtility.__init__")
```

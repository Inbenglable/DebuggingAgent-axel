To resolve the issue, I need to find the source code for the method responsible for invoking the subprocess within the `django.db.backends.postgres.client` module. Since the previous search did not yield relevant results, I will conduct a search for the method that fits this description within the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("run")  # Trying to find the method involving a subprocess invocation
```

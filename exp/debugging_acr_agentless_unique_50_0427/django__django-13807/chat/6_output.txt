To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code of the `check_constraints` method from the `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py` file. This method is responsible for handling foreign key constraint checks, and modification is required to handle SQL reserved words properly.

I'll proceed to search for the `check_constraints` method within the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py", "check_constraints")
```

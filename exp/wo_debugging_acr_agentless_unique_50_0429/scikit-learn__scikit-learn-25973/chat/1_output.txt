To resolve this issue, we should first locate and review the source code of the `SequentialFeatureSelector` class alongside its method that deals with cross-validation (likely the `fit` method or any method that handles the `cv` attribute). This will allow us to identify potential areas where the iterable of splits is not being handled correctly. Since the method is likely in the `SequentialFeatureSelector` class, I will start by searching for this class's source code within the Scikit-learn codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("SequentialFeatureSelector")
search_method_in_codebase("SequentialFeatureSelector.fit")
```

To resolve the issue, it would be helpful to examine the implementation of the `request` method within the `requests` library and specifically focus on converting the method argument to a string type if it's not already in the correct type to prevent the `UnicodeDecodeError`. Given that `sessions.py:313` is mentioned, the priority will be identifying the `request` method and inspecting the code relevant to the handling of the method argument in this file. 

Hence, I need to retrieve the source code for the `request` method within the `sessions.py` file to fully understand the implementation. 

```python
search_method_in_file("requests/sessions.py", "request")
```

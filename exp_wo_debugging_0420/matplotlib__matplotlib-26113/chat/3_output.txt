To address the issue regarding the inconsistent behavior of the `mincnt` parameter in the `hexbin` function of the **matplotlib** project, it is essential to examine the relevant lines of code and the functions involved. The issue description provides links to the code dealing with `mincnt` when `C` is and isn't `None`. I need to retrieve the source code to understand the current implementation and make the necessary modifications.

The relevant sections to be investigated are located in `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py`. Specifically, code handling `mincnt` when `C` is `None` and `C` is provided are indicated, so I will retrieve the code from those lines.

```python
search_code_in_file("lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py", "mincnt=mincnt is None and 0 or mincnt")
search_code_in_file("lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py", "if len(vals) > mincnt:")
```

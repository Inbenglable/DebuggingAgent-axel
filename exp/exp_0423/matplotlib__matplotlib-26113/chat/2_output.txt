Based on the given problem description and test output, the issue arises with the `mincnt` parameter behavior in the `hexbin` function when the `C` parameter is supplied. The behavior discrepancy occurs due to how the condition `len(vals) > mincnt` is implemented when `C` is not `None`.

To identify the root cause, we need to investigate the specific part of the code that handles the `mincnt` condition when `C` parameter is provided.

The relevant code for this was referenced in the issue description and can be found in the `axes/_axes.py` file. The specific location of interest is around line 4625.

Thus, the next step is to trace and observe the following method:

Observed method: `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py:Axes.hexbin`

Analyzing the issue, the error traceback indicates the problem arises when `ax.bar()` is called with NaN values. The issue seems to be related to how NaN values are processed in the method `Axes._convert_dx`.

From the traceback, the error occurs in the following sequence of method calls:
1. `Axes.bar` calls `Axes._convert_dx`.
2. `Axes._convert_dx` attempts to find the first finite value using `cbook._safe_first_finite`.
3. `cbook._safe_first_finite` raises a `StopIteration` exception because there are no finite values in the iterable.

Given this flow, the next logical step is to trace what goes wrong inside the `_convert_dx` method of the `Axes` class. Specifically, how it interacts with `cbook._safe_first_finite` when dealing with only NaN values.

Thus, the next method to observe is:

Observed method: `matplotlib/axes/_axes.py:Axes._convert_dx`

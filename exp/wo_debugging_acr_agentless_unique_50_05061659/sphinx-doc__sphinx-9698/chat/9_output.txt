To address the issue regarding the index entry with parens for the `py:method` directive with `:property:` option, I'll adjust the `get_index_text` method within the `PyProperty` class. Here's how I'll ensure that index entries don't have parentheses for properties:

1. Update the `get_index_text` method within the `PyProperty` class to handle the `py:method` directive properly when used with the `:property:` option, and remove the parentheses from index entries.

Here's the search and replace operation:

```pythony
### sphinx/domains/python.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        return _('%s (%s property)') % (attrname, clsname)
=======
        return _('%s %s property') % (attrname, clsname)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change should ensure that the index entries are formatted correctly as per the requirement, without altering the existing functionality for other cases.

Now, let's convert this into the JSON format as requested:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sphinx/domains/python.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        return _('%s (%s property)') % (attrname, clsname)\n=======\n        return _('%s %s property') % (attrname, clsname)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

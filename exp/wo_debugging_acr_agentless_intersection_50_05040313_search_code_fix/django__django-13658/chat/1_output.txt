To resolve the issue, we need to examine the `ManagementUtility` class and its initialization method where it sets `self.prog_name`. Additionally, we need to check how `CommandParser` is instantiated within the context of this class. 

First, we need to retrieve the source code of the `ManagementUtility` class and its relevant methods.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ManagementUtility")
search_method_in_codebase("CommandParser")
```

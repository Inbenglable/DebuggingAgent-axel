To address the issue of dropping support for SQLite versions older than 3.9.0, I need to examine the parts of the Django codebase that check for the SQLite version. Generally, this could involve checking the database backend's initialization or compatibility checking mechanism.

I will start by searching the codebase for any functionality related to SQLite version checking.

```python
search_code_in_codebase("SQLite version")
search_code_in_codebase("version check")
search_method_in_codebase("check_sqlite_version")
```

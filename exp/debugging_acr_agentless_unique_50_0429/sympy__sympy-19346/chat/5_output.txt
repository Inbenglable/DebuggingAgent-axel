Based on the analysis of the current observation, the issue arises from improper handling of `set` and `dict` types when using the `srepr` function. The `doprint` method in `ReprPrinter` calls the `_print` method, which traverses the Python class hierarchy (`classes`) of `expr` looking for a suitable print method specifically for the `set` type (i.e., `_print_set`). However, it seems that no such method is implemented for handling a `set` type using SymPy's internal representation. Consequently, the `_print` method defaults to using `self.emptyPrinter(expr)`, which results in the standard Python representation `{y, x}`.

To resolve the issue, a specialized print method for the `set` type, likely named `_print_set`, should be implemented to transform it appropriately into SymPy's `FiniteSet` representation.

Now, based on this analysis, I will locate and analyze the `_print` method, specifically observing if a print method for sets might exist, and inspect the logic where it defaults to using `emptyPrinter`.

Buggy method: `sympy/printing/printer.py:ReprPrinter._print`

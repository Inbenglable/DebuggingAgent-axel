Let's start by examining the code where `hexbin` is called, focusing on the cases involving the `mincnt` and `C` parameters. We'll trace the execution to see how `hexbin` handles these parameters differently.

The observation should begin at the method where `hexbin` is defined. Therefore, let's observe the `hexbin` method in the `Axes` class, which is responsible for creating hexbin plots.

Observed method: `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py:Axes.hexbin`

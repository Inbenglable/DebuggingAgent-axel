To address the issue, I need to investigate how `ax.bar` handles NaN inputs and why it throws an exception. From the traceback, the issue seems related to the `_convert_dx` method in the `Axes` class in the `matplotlib/axes/_axes.py` file and the `_safe_first_finite` method in `cbook/__init__.py`. I need to retrieve and inspect these methods' source code to understand the problem better.

```python
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py", "Axes.bar")
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py", "_safe_first_finite")
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py", "_convert_dx")
```

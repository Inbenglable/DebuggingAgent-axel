To resolve the issue, I need to understand the `kernS` function from the sympy library, which seems to have the error related to the variable `kern` being referenced before it is assigned a value. To proceed, I'll need to retrieve the source code for the `kernS` method. Since I do not have the file path of the method, I will search for the method in the whole project codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("kernS")
```

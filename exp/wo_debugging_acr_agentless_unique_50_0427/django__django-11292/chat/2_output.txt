To implement the `--skip-checks` option effectively, I need to review how command-line arguments are added and processed in the `BaseCommand` class, and particularly examine the methods related to argument creation and execution. The key methods to look into would likely be `add_arguments` and `execute`.

Let's start by retrieving the source code for the `add_arguments` and `execute` methods from the `BaseCommand` class to determine how to incorporate `--skip-checks` into the command options.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/management/base.py", "BaseCommand.add_arguments")
search_method_in_file("django/core/management/base.py", "BaseCommand.execute")
```

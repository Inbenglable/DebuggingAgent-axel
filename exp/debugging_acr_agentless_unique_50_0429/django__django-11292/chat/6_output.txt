Before generating the patch, it's necessary to retrieve the exact implementation of the `CommandParser.__init__` method, as well as the `BaseCommand.create_parser` method. These methods handle argument parsing, and we need to modify them to include the `--skip-checks` option.

Let's proceed by searching for these methods in their respective files:

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/management/base.py", "CommandParser.__init__")
search_method_in_file("django/core/management/base.py", "BaseCommand.create_parser")
```

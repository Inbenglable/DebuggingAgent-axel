I have already retrieved the necessary source code for the functions involved: `TR6`, `_TR56`, and `bottom_up`. The issue arises from an invalid comparison of a complex number, specifically the imaginary unit `I`, in these functions. Based on the traceback, the check `if (rv.exp < 0) == True` is where the error occurs due to trying to compare complex exponents.

To address this, a more suitable approach is to use the method `rv.exp.is_negative` instead of `(rv.exp < 0) == True` to check if the power is negative, which should correctly handle cases where `rv.exp` is a complex number. Similarly, for positive checks, `rv.exp.is_positive` can be used.

With this understanding, I am ready to generate a patch for the issue.

Ready generation: `True`

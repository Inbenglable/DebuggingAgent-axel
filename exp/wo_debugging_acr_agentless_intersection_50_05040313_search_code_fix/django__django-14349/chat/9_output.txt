The patch was intended to strip unwanted characters (line feed `\n`, carriage return `\r`, and tab `\t`) before validating URLs with the `URLValidator`.

Reviewing the provided patch:

```python
def __call__(self, value):
    # Strip unwanted characters
    value = value.replace('\n', '').replace('\r', '').replace('\t', '')
```

The code modifies the `__call__` method of the `URLValidator` class to strip these characters before any further processing.

Now, let's look at the test outputs before and after the patch:

**Original Output:**

- The test fails with `AssertionError: ValidationError not raised` for the URLs containing line feed characters.

**Patched Output:**

- The same test still fails with `AssertionError: ValidationError not raised` for the URLs. There is no change in the behavior; the test output is identical to the original output.

Based on the above analysis:

1. The patch was correctly developed to strip unwanted characters before validation.
2. Despite the applied patch, the tests still fail, indicating that the issue is not resolved.

Thus, the issue remains unresolved:

Issue resolved: `False`

To begin resolving the issue:

### Analysis of the Current Observed Code and Abnormal Program Behavior:

1. **Issue Summary**:
   - The exception arises when YoutubeDL logs to the pytest captured output because it checks for `b` in `out.mode` to decide whether to write `bytes` or `str`.
   - `_pytest.capture.EncodedFile` incorrectly advertises `rb+`, the mode of the underlying stream.
   - This results in a `TypeError` when `write()` is called with `bytes`.

2. **Observational Code**:
   - The test case uses `youtube_dl.YoutubeDL()` and attempts logging via `to_screen()`.
   - The error traceback indicates the issue arises from the `_pytest.capture.EncodedFile` class when handling data that YoutubeDL writes as `bytes`.

3. **Root Cause Hypothesis**:
   - The `EncodedFile` class advertises its mode incorrectly, suggesting binary when it should be text.
   - This misadvertisement leads to an error in the `write()` function.

### Observing the Next Method:

Given the error description, the `_pytest.capture.EncodedFile` is likely involved. To trace further and identify where the mode is set:

**Observed Method**: `src/_pytest/capture.py:EncodedFile.__init__`

We will examine its initialization to understand how and why the mode might be incorrectly set. It's crucial to verify how `_pytest.capture.EncodedFile` interacts with the underlying stream, particularly its mode configuration and how it reports it.

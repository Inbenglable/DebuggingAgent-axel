Based on the information retrieved, the source code for the `visit_Tuple` method in the `_UnparseVisitor` class already provides a good context. This method concatenates the elements of a tuple into a string, but it doesn't handle the case for a single-element tuple correctly. This is where the bug arises, when a trailing comma is not added for tuples with a single item. 

To resolve this, we can add a conditional check to see if the tuple has exactly one element and modify the string to ensure it includes a trailing comma when required.

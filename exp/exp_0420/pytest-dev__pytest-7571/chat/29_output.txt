Thanks for the detailed information. Based on the current analysis, the bug occurs because the log levels set during a test are not being restored correctly. We need to ensure that the `LogCaptureFixture._finalize` method, which is responsible for restoring the log levels, is functioning properly. 

To continue tracing and precisely identify the root cause, the next step is to focus on the `_finalize` method. Here's the specific code snippet already observed, which is critical for restoring log levels:

```python
def _finalize(self) -> None:
    """
    This restores the log levels changed by :meth:`set_level`.
    """
    # restore log levels
    for logger_name, level in self._initial_logger_levels.items():
        logger = logging.getLogger(logger_name)
        logger.setLevel(level)
```

So, the next logically observed step is further inspection of how `_initial_logger_levels` is being updated. We need to ensure that `self._initial_logger_levels` is correctly storing the initial log levels before any changes.

### Next Observed Method
Let's move to the initialization part and settings of log levels to trace the abnormal behavior step-by-step:

- Observed method: `LogCaptureFixture.__init__`

This should give us insight into how the initial log levels are being stored, which may confirm if the levels are being tracked properly or identify the specific point of failure.

Once we have this information, we can conclude the root cause and submit the necessary fix.

Observed method: `src/_pytest/logging.py:LogCaptureFixture.__init__`.

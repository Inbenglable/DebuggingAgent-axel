Based on the provided log, the issue arises because the `warm_start` parameter is not exposed in the `IsolationForest` class, resulting in a `ValueError` when attempting to set it via `set_params`. 

From the traceback, the `ValueError` is triggered in the `set_params` method because `warm_start` is not listed in the valid parameters for the `IsolationForest` estimator.

To locate the source of this problem, I need to investigate the constructor of `IsolationForest` to determine how parameters are defined and which are exposed.

Observed method: `sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py:IsolationForest.__init__`

To resolve the IndexError in the `is_fits` method, we need to ensure that the `args` tuple is not empty before accessing its first element. Here's the proposed patch:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### astropy/io/fits/connect.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    return isinstance(args[0], (HDUList, TableHDU, BinTableHDU, GroupsHDU))\n=======\n    return len(args) > 0 and isinstance(args[0], (HDUList, TableHDU, BinTableHDU, GroupsHDU))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This modification checks if `args` contains any elements (`len(args) > 0`) before attempting to access `args[0]`. This prevents the IndexError from occurring when `args` is empty, thus resolving the reported issue without affecting existing functionality.

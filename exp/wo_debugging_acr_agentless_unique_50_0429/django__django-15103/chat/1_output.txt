To resolve the issue, I need to look at the source code of the `json_script` function to understand its current implementation and how the `element_id` argument is being used. This will help in making the argument optional. Let's start by searching for the `json_script` method in the Django codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("json_script")
```

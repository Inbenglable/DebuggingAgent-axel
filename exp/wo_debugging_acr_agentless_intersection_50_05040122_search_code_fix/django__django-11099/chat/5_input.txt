Now You need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
UsernameValidator allows trailing newline in usernames
Description
	
ASCIIUsernameValidator and UnicodeUsernameValidator use the regex 
r'^[\w.@+-]+$'
The intent is to only allow alphanumeric characters as well as ., @, +, and -. However, a little known quirk of Python regexes is that $ will also match a trailing newline. Therefore, the user name validators will accept usernames which end with a newline. You can avoid this behavior by instead using \A and \Z to terminate regexes. For example, the validator regex could be changed to
r'\A[\w.@+-]+\Z'
in order to reject usernames that end with a newline.
I am not sure how to officially post a patch, but the required change is trivial - using the regex above in the two validators in contrib.auth.validators.

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue with `UsernameValidator`, we need to locate the regex in the implementations of `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator`. These are likely classes within the Django `contrib.auth.validators` module. 

I will search for these classes directly in the codebase to find their implementation and identify the exact location where the regex needs to be updated.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ASCIIUsernameValidator")
search_class_in_codebase("UnicodeUsernameValidator")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_class_in_codebase("ASCIIUsernameValidator")
RESULT:
#### django/contrib/auth/validators.py:ASCIIUsernameValidator
```python
class ASCIIUsernameValidator(validators.RegexValidator):
    regex = r'^[\w.@+-]+$'
    message = _(
        'Enter a valid username. This value may contain only English letters, '
        'numbers, and @/./+/-/_ characters.'
    )
    flags = re.ASCII
```


### API INVOKE: search_class_in_codebase("UnicodeUsernameValidator")
RESULT:
#### django/contrib/auth/validators.py:UnicodeUsernameValidator
```python
class UnicodeUsernameValidator(validators.RegexValidator):
    regex = r'^[\w.@+-]+$'
    message = _(
        'Enter a valid username. This value may contain only letters, '
        'numbers, and @/./+/-/_ characters.'
    )
    flags = 0
```

Your Output:
Ready generation: `True`

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```


ERROR! Your Reponse: {'search_replace_edits': ["### django/contrib/auth/validators.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    regex = r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'\n=======\n    regex = r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n", "### django/contrib/auth/validators.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    regex = r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'\n=======\n    regex = r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"]}.
Your response format is invalid: Search pattern not found in file.
Please try again.

Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
Generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* patches to fix the issue.

Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
1. The file path
2. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
3. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
4. The dividing line: =======
5. The lines to replace into the source code
6. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE

Here is an example of a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit:

```python
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

At the end of your analysis, provide edit result in the following JSON format:
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

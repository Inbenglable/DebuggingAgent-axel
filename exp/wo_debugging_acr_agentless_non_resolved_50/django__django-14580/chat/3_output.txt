To resolve this issue, the next step is to explore the `as_string` method within the `MigrationWriter` class in the file `django/db/migrations/writer.py`. This method is likely responsible for creating the migration file content. Once I have the method's source code, I can determine if modifications are needed to handle the missing import for `models`. 

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/writer.py", "MigrationWriter.as_string")
```

### Patch Review

The patch correctly aims to address the issue by allowing `DISTINCT` support for `Avg` and `Sum` aggregates. It modifies the respective classes in `django/db/models/aggregates.py` to include the `allow_distinct` attribute set to `True`. This appears to be an appropriate modification to potentially resolve the issue described.

### Test Output Analysis

**Original Output:**
- The original output shows an `AppRegistryNotReady` exception, indicating that the Django apps aren't loaded yet. This is unrelated to the issue described (which concerns aggregation behavior), but rather a setup issue with the test script itself failing due to app configuration errors.

**Patched Output:**
- The patched output still shows the same `AppRegistryNotReady` exception. The test configuration issue persists, preventing the actual test code for `Avg` and `Sum` aggregates from being executed successfully.

### Conclusion

While the patch seems logically correct for the aggregation issue, the persistent error in test setup prevents confirmation of its effectiveness. The failure is due to application registry problems, not the aggregation logic. For validation of the patch, the test setup must be corrected so that Django apps are appropriately initialized and tests can correctly evaluate the aggregation functionality.

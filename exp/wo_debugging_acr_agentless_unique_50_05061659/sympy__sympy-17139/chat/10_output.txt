Based on the issue and our plan to resolve it by modifying the `_TR56` method to check whether the exponent is a number before making comparisons, here are the necessary changes formatted in the requested *SEARCH/REPLACE* format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/simplify/fu.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if (rv.exp < 0) == True:\n=======\n        if rv.exp.is_number and (rv.exp < 0) == True:\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### sympy/simplify/fu.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if (rv.exp > max) == True:\n=======\n        if rv.exp.is_number and (rv.exp > max) == True:\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

These changes ensure that comparisons are only made when the exponent is a real number, thereby preventing invalid operations on complex numbers.

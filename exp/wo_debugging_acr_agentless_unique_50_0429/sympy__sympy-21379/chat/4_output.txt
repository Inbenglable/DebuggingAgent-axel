To understand and resolve the issue, I need to delve into the details of the methods and classes involved. While I've already retrieved the general structure of `Piecewise`, `subs`, and `sinh`, I'll specifically need to look into the substitution mechanism `_eval_subs` within `Piecewise`, since this seems closely tied to the error.

Let's proceed with retrieving the source code for `_eval_subs` in the `Piecewise` class and possibly other related methods or handling within the `sympy` repository to better locate where the error might be occurring.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py", "_eval_subs")
search_method_in_file("sympy/polys/polyerrors.py", "PolynomialError")
```

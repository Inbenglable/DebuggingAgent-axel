## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Modeling's `separability_matrix` does not compute separability correctly for nested CompoundModels
Consider the following model:

```python
from astropy.modeling import models as m
from astropy.modeling.separable import separability_matrix

cm = m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)
```

It's separability matrix as you might expect is a diagonal:

```python
>>> separability_matrix(cm)
array([[ True, False],
       [False,  True]])
```

If I make the model more complex:
```python
>>> separability_matrix(m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5))
array([[ True,  True, False, False],
       [ True,  True, False, False],
       [False, False,  True, False],
       [False, False, False,  True]])
```

The output matrix is again, as expected, the outputs and inputs to the linear models are separable and independent of each other.

If however, I nest these compound models:
```python
>>> separability_matrix(m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm)
array([[ True,  True, False, False],
       [ True,  True, False, False],
       [False, False,  True,  True],
       [False, False,  True,  True]])
```
Suddenly the inputs and outputs are no longer separable?

This feels like a bug to me, but I might be missing something?

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
The provided test script is trying to verify the behavior of the `separability_matrix()` method from `astropy.modeling.separable`. The issue is that when combining models into nested compound models, the expected separability matrix doesn't match the computed matrix, specifically when using the Pix2Sky_TAN model nested with another compound model.

Analyzing the given information:

1. **Model Definition:**
   - `cm = m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)` results in a separability matrix where inputs and outputs are independent.
   - `nested_cm = m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm` is supposed to maintain separability, but the computed matrix does not match the expected separability matrix.

2. **Expected vs. Actual Behavior:**
   - Expected separability for the `nested_cm`:
     ```
     [[True, True, False, False],
      [True, True, False, False],
      [False, False, True, False],
      [False, False, False, True]]
     ```
   - Computed separability for the `nested_cm`:
     ```
     [[True, True, False, False],
      [True, True, False, False],
      [False, False, True, True],
      [False, False, True, True]]
     ```

The behavior of the `separability_matrix()` function seems not to respect the expected separable behavior when dealing with nested compound models. I will need to observe the logic applied within the `separability_matrix()` which likely involves the compound models handling and coordination of inputs and outputs between model elements.

Therefore, the next step is to observe the method responsible for calculating separability within `separability_matrix()` or its related component that handles compound modeling.

Observed method: `astropy/modeling/separable.py:_separable`
==================================================
The method `_separable` function is part of the logic that calculates the separability of outputs for a given model or compound model. The issue here arises because when the separability matrix is calculated, the expected behavior for nested compound models is not achieved.

### Analysis of the Current Observed Code:

1. **Function `_separable`:**
   - This function takes a `transform` object as input, which can either be a simple model or a compound model.
   - It checks if the transform already has a precomputed separability matrix via `_calculate_separability_matrix()`. If it's there, it's used directly; otherwise, it proceeds with further calculations.
   - If the transform is a `CompoundModel`, it recursively computes separability using its `left` and `right` components.
   - It seems to use `_coord_matrix` for normal `Model` instances, which helps create a basic coordinate matrix for linear models.

2. **Observed Problem:**
   - The main issue occurs specifically when dealing with nested compound models. 
   - The computed separability matrix does not align with expectations, indicating that the logic handling nested compound models might not correctly account for the structure and hierarchy of such models.

3. **Runtime Information:**
   - Execution did flow correctly to different branches depending on whether the transform is a `CompoundModel` or a `Model`.
   - However, for the nested compound model, the output does not match the expected separability matrix, implying a logical gap in handling nested structures.

### Next Steps

Since the problem lies in how the logic is combining the results of nested components, we should investigate how the operators for combining separability matrices are applied and possibly incorrect handling of nested structures.

We need to look specifically at the operator logic in `_operators`, which applies operations based on the combination (`&`) of separability matrices for the left and right models in the compound structure.

### Proposed Observation

Let's delve deeper into how separability for compound models is calculated. We should examine the scope of the return line where `_operators[transform.op]` is applied:

```python
Observed scope: `astropy/modeling/separable.py:306-309`
```

This should give insight into how separability is being finalized for compound models and where nested logic might be mishandled.
==================================================
Analyzing the traced code execution reveals that the method `_separable` in `astropy/modeling/separable.py` is responsible for calculating the separability matrix. However, the issue arises due to the improper handling of nested `CompoundModel` instances using the `_cstack` operator. This operator is expected to determine how separability matrices of compound models are combined, affecting the separability matrix structure.

### Observations:
1. **Problematic Behavior**: The logic inside `_cstack`, used to combine the separability matrices of nested models, results in unexpected non-separable output when models are nested. This indicates that the way matrices are combined doesn't preserve the separability for nested models correctly.

2. **Test Results**: The computed separability matrix has unexpected values because the matrices of nested compound models are not preserved appropriately during the combination using `_cstack`.

Based on these observations, it is likely that the buggy behavior originates from the `_cstack` operator's implementation within the `_operators` dictionary. This operator should be ensuring proper separability behavior for nested models, but it seems to be mishandling them instead.

### Next Steps:
It is now crucial to further investigate the `_cstack` operatorâ€™s functionality and logic to pinpoint the potential flaw in handling nested structures correctly. This may involve observing how `_cstack` defines matrix stacking procedures and coordinates within `astropy/modeling/separable.py`.

Hence, to trace deeper into the problem, I will now observe the `_cstack` operator in order to locate any deviations or mistakes in computation.

```plaintext
Observed method: `astropy/modeling/separable.py:_cstack`
```
==================================================
The `_cstack` function is responsible for combining the separability matrices of compound models when using the `&` operation. The issue is related to how separability matrices are merged for nested compound models, particularly when they involve transformations like `Pix2Sky_TAN`.

### Analysis
1. **Behavior of `_cstack`:**
   - The function creates zero matrices for both the left and right inputs.
   - For `left`, it populates the top-left corner of the zero matrix with the actual non-zero elements from `left` matrix, ensuring it fits within the dimensions.
   - For `right`, the bottom-right corner gets filled with ones, ensuring it fits likewise.
   - Finally, it horizontally stacks these two matrices with `np.hstack`.

2. **Problematic Behavior:**
   - When the `_cstack` function creates separate matrices (`cleft` and `cright`) and stacks them, the resulting combination doesn't preserve the intended separability properties of nested compound models.
   - Specifically, in the context of nested models, the expected zero-filled portions seem to appear erroneously as those left-hand or right-hand model components get compounded, resulting in incorrect separability assertions.

3. **Runtime evidence of the issue:** 
   - The nested compound model's separability matrix confirms the final stacked matrix lacks expected zeros, indicating improper handling for the stacking of separability metrics specifically due to nesting.

### Next Steps:
Diving deeper into the `_cstack` operator, we should explore the handling of matrix dimensions and manipulations, particularly lines that define the zero matrices (`cleft` and `cright`) and their population to ensure correct merging logic for nested/compound configurations.

Since `_cstack` needs to handle nested configurations more intelligently, I will review its core logic of matrix portions handling.

To proceed, let's inspect the matrix construction and stacking logic for nested handling.

```plaintext
Observed scope: `astropy/modeling/separable.py:237-245`
```
==================================================
The analysis of the `_cstack` operator's snippet indicates that the construction of zero matrices `cleft` and `cright` and their subsequent population with values from `left` and `right` might not correctly manage the layout of nested compound models, leading to incorrect separability calculations.

### Problem Identification:
1. **Matrix Construction**: 
   - `cleft` and `cright` matrices are initialized with zeroes and only partly populated with 1s, which impacts the final combined separability matrix. 
   - These matrices are prepared using the shapes of left and right matrices but do not seem to adequately account for nested compound configurations, leading to unexpected overlaps or non-zero entries.

2. **Potential Discrepancy**:
   - As seen, `cright` is populated with ones at the bottom-right, affecting the intended zeros in separable positions when stacking.
   - This leads to a final separability matrix that does not match the expected outcome, especially noticeable in nested compound model scenarios.

### Debug Insights:
- **Logic Review Needed**: The logic that populates these matrices before stacking must be revisited to ensure proper alignmentâ€”particularly focusing on ensuring non-overlapping, correctly aligned matrix sections for nested designs.
- **Focus on Line**:
  - Line 245: `cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = 1` might be the core of the anomaly, where ones are populated unchecked into empty portions that should remain isolated for nested compounds.

Given the observations and diagnostic review, the `_cstack` method is suspect to potential flaws leading to incorrect nested separability. The necessary amendments likely revolve around better managing how matrices embrace nested designs.

Based on this assessment, I'm equipped to proceed to the adjustment phase or postulate a fix within this function block:

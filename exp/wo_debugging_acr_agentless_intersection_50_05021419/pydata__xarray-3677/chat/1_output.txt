Observing the issue, it appears that the `Dataset.merge` method does not handle a `DataArray` input appropriately, leading to an `AttributeError`. This suggests that the `merge` method is not prepared to handle `DataArray` objects, which might require converting them or treating them differently than `Dataset` objects within the function.

To address this, I need to investigate the `merge` method within the `Dataset` class in `xarray` to understand its implementation and how it manages different types of inputs. The location of the method based on the traceback is likely within `xarray/core/dataset.py`, but I will confirm that by locating the `Dataset` class and its `merge` method within the repository.

Let's proceed with retrieving the relevant source code.

```python
search_method_in_file("xarray/core/dataset.py", "Dataset.merge")
search_class_in_file("xarray/core/dataset.py", "Dataset")
```

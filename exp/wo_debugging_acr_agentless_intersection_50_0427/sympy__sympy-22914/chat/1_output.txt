To resolve the issue, I will need to locate the `PythonCodePrinter` class in the sympy project to understand where to add the `_print_Min` and `_print_Max` methods. From the issue description, it seems like these methods should be added to this class. Therefore, I will need to retrieve the source code of the `PythonCodePrinter` class.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("PythonCodePrinter")
```

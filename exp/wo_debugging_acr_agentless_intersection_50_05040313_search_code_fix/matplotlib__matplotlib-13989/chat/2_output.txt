I need to retrieve the source code of the `hist` method within the `gca()` function to understand how it processes the `range` parameter, particularly when `density=True`. The `hist()` method in `lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py` calls `gca().hist(...)`, but I need to know the implementation details of the `hist` method being called.

To proceed, I should find the method within the matplotlib axes class, which is typically where plotting functions reside.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("Axes.hist")
```

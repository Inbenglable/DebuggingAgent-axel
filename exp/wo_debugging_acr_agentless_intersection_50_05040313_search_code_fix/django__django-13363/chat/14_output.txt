The test output before and after applying the patch is identical, indicating that the underlying issue persists. Both outputs show an `OperationalError` due to a missing table: `__main___timeslots`. This suggests that the root cause of the problem hasn't been addressed by the provided patch, and thus, the issue is not fixed.

Additionally, the patch itself focuses on altering the `as_sql` method to use a provided `tzinfo` parameter, but the error related to the missing table implies that the patch doesn't address the database setup or table creation problem found in the testing setup.

Issue resolved: `False`

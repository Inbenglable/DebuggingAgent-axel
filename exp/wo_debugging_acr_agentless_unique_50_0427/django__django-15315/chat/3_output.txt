The source code for the `__hash__` method in the `Field` class has already been retrieved. Given the issue description and the code retrieved, it's clear that the `__hash__` method causes the hash value to change when the field is assigned to a model class. 

To resolve this issue, we need to revert the change introduced in #31750. This means ensuring that the hash value of a `Field` object remains constant even when it is assigned to a model class. The typical approach is to have an immutable attribute, such as a unique identifier or the `creation_counter`, determine the hash.

Since we've retrieved the `Field` class and its `__hash__()` method, we're ready to generate the patch to fix this issue.

To resolve the issue by adding `DISTINCT` support for `Avg` and `Sum` aggregates in Django, we need to adjust the `allow_distinct` attribute of the `Avg` and `Sum` classes. Here are the required modifications:

```pythony
### django/db/models/aggregates.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):  
=======
class Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):
    allow_distinct = True
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```pythony
### django/db/models/aggregates.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):  
=======
class Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):
    allow_distinct = True
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, providing the final JSON patch:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):  \n=======\nclass Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):  \n=======\nclass Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

The above changes will allow `Avg` and `Sum` to process aggregates with the `DISTINCT` keyword, effectively solving the issue.

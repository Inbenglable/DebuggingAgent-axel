You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To address the issue, we need to investigate how the comparison of complex numbers is handled in the `TR6` and `_TR56` functions in `fu.py`. This requires understanding the internal logic of these methods.

To make the necessary modifications, we'll start by retrieving the source code for the `TR6` and `_TR56` methods from the `fu.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/simplify/fu.py", "TR6")
search_method_in_file("sympy/simplify/fu.py", "_TR56")
```

==================================================

Your Output:
Here's the plan to resolve the issue:

The error occurs because comparing a complex number to an integer with `<` or `>` operators is invalid. This happens inside the `_TR56` method when checking `if (rv.exp < 0) == True:` and `if (rv.exp > max) == True:`.

To fix this issue, we need to update the `_TR56` method to handle cases where `rv.exp` can be a complex number more gracefully.

Given the source code we've retrieved for `TR6` and `_TR56`, we are ready to generate the patch to handle the complex number comparison safely.

Ready generation: `True`

```python
# Since we know where the comparison happens, I will construct the patch directly.
```

## Patch:

Here's the patch for the `_TR56` method in `sympy/simplify/fu.py`:

```python
def _TR56(rv, f, g, h, max, pow):
    """Helper for TR5 and TR6 to replace f**2 with h(g**2)

    Options
    =======

    max :   controls size of exponent that can appear on f
            e.g. if max=4 then f**4 will be changed to h(g**2)**2.
    pow :   controls whether the exponent must be a perfect power of 2
            e.g. if pow=True (and max >= 6) then f**6 will not be changed
            but f**8 will be changed to h(g**2)**4

    >>> from sympy.simplify.fu import _TR56 as T
    >>> from sympy.abc import x
    >>> from sympy import sin, cos
    >>> h = lambda x: 1 - x
    >>> T(sin(x)**3, sin, cos, h, 4, False)
    sin(x)**3
    >>> T(sin(x)**6, sin, cos, h, 6, False)
    (1 - cos(x)**2)**3
    >>> T(sin(x)**6, sin, cos, h, 6, True)
    sin(x)**6
    >>> T(sin(x)**8, sin, cos, h, 10, True)
    (1 - cos(x)**2)**4
    """

    def _f(rv):
        # I'm not sure if this transformation should target all even powers
        # or only those expressible as powers of 2. Also, should it only
        # make the changes in powers that appear in sums -- making an isolated
        # change is not going to allow a simplification as far as I can tell.
        if not (rv.is_Pow and rv.base.func == f):
            return rv

        if rv.exp.is_number and (rv.exp < 0) == True:
            return rv
        if rv.exp.is_number and (rv.exp > max) == True:
            return rv
        if rv.exp == 2:
            return h(g(rv.base.args[0])**2)
        else:
            if rv.exp == 4:
                e = 2
            elif not pow:

                    return rv
                e = rv.exp//2
            else:
                p = perfect_power(rv.exp)
                if not p:
                    return rv
                e = rv.exp//2
            return h(g(rv.base.args[0])**2)**e

    return bottom_up(rv, _f)
```

## Tests:

To verify the fix, let's write appropriate test cases:

```python
# Create a new test file: tests/test_issue_patch.py

from sympy import Symbol, simplify, I, cos

def test_simplify_cos_I():
    x = Symbol('x')
    assert simplify(cos(x)**I) == cos(x)**I

def test_simplify_cos_complex_exponent():
    x = Symbol('x')
    assert simplify(cos(x)**(3 * I)) == cos(x)**(3 * I)

def test_simplify_cos_real_exponent():
    x = Symbol('x')
    assert simplify(cos(x)**2) == 1 - sin(x)**2
    assert simplify(cos(x)**4) == (1 - sin(x)**2)**2

if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_simplify_cos_I()
    test_simplify_cos_complex_exponent()
    test_simplify_cos_real_exponent()
    print("All tests passed!")
```

After applying the patch, run the new test file to ensure the changes work correctly. If the tests pass, submit the pull request with the patch and the new test cases.
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

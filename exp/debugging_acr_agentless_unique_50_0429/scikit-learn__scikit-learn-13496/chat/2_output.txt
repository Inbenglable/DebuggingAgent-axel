To resolve the issue of exposing the `warm_start` parameter in the `IsolationForest` model, let's analyze the current situation:

1. **Problem Statement**: The `warm_start` parameter, which is supported by the parent class `BaseBagging`, is not currently exposed in the `IsolationForest`'s `__init__()` method. 

2. **Error Trace**: The error trace shows that setting `warm_start=True` raises a `ValueError`, stating "Invalid parameter warm_start for estimator IsolationForest...". This indicates that `warm_start` is not recognized as a valid parameter for `IsolationForest`.

3. **Current Code**: The `__init__()` method of `IsolationForest` does not include `warm_start` in its parameters, although it should be able to inherit it from `BaseBagging`.

Given this analysis, we need to expose the `warm_start` parameter in the `IsolationForest` class, ensuring that it is included in its `__init__()` method.

### Next Step

To identify the exact location for the code change, we should track where the parameters are passed from `IsolationForest` to `BaseBagging`. Since we already have a good understanding of the problem, we can directly focus on the bug's location:

```plaintext
Observed scope: sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py:167-193
```

We will review how parameters are processed and inherited to identify the exact change required to include `warm_start`. Once we confirm the interactions, we can proceed to modify the constructor to expose this parameter.

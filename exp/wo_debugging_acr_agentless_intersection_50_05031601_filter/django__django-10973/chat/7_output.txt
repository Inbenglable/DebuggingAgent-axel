To determine which of the returned contents are relevant, let's analyze them with respect to the issue. We are looking for a method involving a subprocess invocation that could be using `subprocess.run` in the `django.db.backends.postgres.client` module.

### Analysis of Returned Content:
1. **tests/gis_tests/test_measure.py:run**
   - This method is related to running a test suite using `unittest.TextTestRunner`. It's not related to PostgreSQL backend management or subprocess invocation for a database client.

2. **django/core/servers/basehttp.py:run**
   - This method appears to configure and run a WSGI server using `httpd` and is unrelated to subprocess invocation for database client management.

### Conclusion:
None of these files involve a subprocess invocation related to setting `PGPASSWORD` or managing PostgreSQL backend connections. Therefore, none of these entries are needed for resolving the issue.

### Selected Results:
No relevant results among the returned content match the needed criteria for fixing the issue.

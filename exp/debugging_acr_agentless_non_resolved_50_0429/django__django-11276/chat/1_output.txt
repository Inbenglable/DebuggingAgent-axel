To determine the root cause of the discrepancy observed in the behavior of `django.utils.html.escape`, let's first understand the issue at hand. The testing script compares outputs from `django.utils.html.escape` and `html.escape` when applied to a test string with single quotes. The assertion failure indicates that the outputs differ only in the way single quotes are escaped. Specifically, `django.utils.html.escape` uses `&#39;` while `html.escape` uses `&#x27;`.

From the traceback, we can infer:
- The assertion fails in the `main` function because `django_escaped` and `stdlib_escaped` are not equal. 
- The `django_escape` function, imported from `django.utils.html`, uses `&#39;` for `'` instead of `&#x27;` used by `html.escape`.

Given this, the observed discrepancy is due to the internal implementation of `django.utils.html.escape`. Since our goal is to update `django.utils.html.escape` to utilize `html.escape`, the issue is likely in the `escape` method within `django.utils.html`.

To pinpoint the exact location of the buggy code, I will observe the `escape` function definition in `django.utils.html`.

Observed method: `django/utils/html.py:escape`

**Patch Review:**

The patch aims to address the issue of missing transaction handling in the `changelist_view` method of Django's admin by introducing the use of `transaction.atomic()`. This change ensures that all the modifications made to the database within the method are part of a single transaction, which can be rolled back in case of an error. The inclusion of the transaction block will enhance data consistency and integrity during the changelist operations.

**Test Output Analysis:**

**Original Output:**
The original output indicates an error due to improper configuration of Django settings, specifically that `INSTALLED_APPS` is not set. This error prevents the execution of the test entirely and doesn't allow for validation of transaction handling during `changelist_view`. 

**Patched Output:**
The patched output repeats the same error â€“ `django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: Requested setting INSTALLED_APPS, but settings are not configured.` Because the error is related to the Django settings configuration, the patch cannot be verified against this output. This indicates that the test environment setup itself is flawed, and the test never reaches the part that checks transaction handling.

**Conclusion:**

The issue isn't directly related to the patch but rather with the test setup (lack of configuration settings). Since the test environment is improperly configured and unable to execute the test, we cannot determine if the patch successfully fixed the issue based purely on the test outputs.

**Issue resolved: `False`**

The environment must be properly configured to run the test and validate the patch effectiveness.

To resolve this issue, I need to obtain the source code of the `urlize` method, as this is where the problem exists based on the debugging agent's analysis. The method is supposedly located in the `django/utils/html.py` file.

I'll use the following API call to retrieve the source code of the `urlize` method:

```python
search_method_in_file("django/utils/html.py", "urlize")
```

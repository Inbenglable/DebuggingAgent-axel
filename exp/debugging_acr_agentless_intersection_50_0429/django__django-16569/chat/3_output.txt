Based on the provided trace and issue description, the problem lies in the `add_fields` method in the `django/forms/formsets.py` file. The issue occurs when the `index` variable is `None`, which is then used in a comparison operation `<` with an integer `initial_form_count`, resulting in a `TypeError`. The intended logic should either handle cases where `index` is `None` explicitly or ensure that `index` is always a valid integer before this point.

From the code walkthrough and the context provided, it seems that the proposed solution of checking if `index` is not `None` before the comparison (`index < initial_form_count`) can potentially fix the issue. The exception occurs precisely at the following program path:

```python
if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or index < initial_form_count):
```

Therefore, the solution likely involves modifying this condition.

Buggy method: `django/forms/formsets.py:BaseFormSet.add_fields`

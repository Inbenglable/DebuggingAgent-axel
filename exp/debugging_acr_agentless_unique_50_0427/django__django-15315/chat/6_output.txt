To generate a patch, I need the source code for the `Field.__hash__` method. This is crucial to ensure any modifications maintain the integrity of the hashing function without dependency on mutable attributes. I have not retrieved this method's source code yet. Thus, I will invoke the `search_method_in_file` function to get the complete method code.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/fields/__init__.py", "Field.__hash__")
```

Based on the analysis, I have identified that the `_cstack` method in `astropy/modeling/separable.py` is responsible for combining the separability matrices of nested `CompoundModels`. The issue lies in the incorrect handling of nested structures, resulting in a faulty separability matrix.

To rectify this, I will adjust `_cstack` to correctly handle combining separability matrices for nested compound models. The key changes involve ensuring the independence between components in nested models is maintained. Given that I already have the source code for the `_cstack` method, I'm ready to proceed with generating a patch.

Ready generation: `True`

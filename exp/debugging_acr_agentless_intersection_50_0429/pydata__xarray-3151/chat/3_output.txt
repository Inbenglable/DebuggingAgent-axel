The issue reported is with the `xr.combine_by_coords` method of the **xarray** library. It raises a `ValueError` when combining datasets that have identical non-monotonic coordinates. The error message indicates that resulting objects must have monotonic global indexes, which conflicts with the documentation stating that non-varying coordinate dimensions should be ignored.

The traceback provided in the test execution doesn't directly point to the xarray source code but reveals a configuration error: `"NameError: name 'sys' is not defined"`. This indicates misconfiguration or oversight in the test script setup.

However, our main focus is on the issue happening within `xr.combine_by_coords`, diverging from the intended behavior of ignoring non-varying coordinate dimensions' monotonicity.

To proceed with debugging, we need to delve into xarray's implementation of `combine_by_coords`. This involves examining the logic that handles coordinate checks during the combination process, specifically regarding non-varying coordinate dimensions.

Next, let's explore the method responsible for inspecting coordinates in the combine functions to pinpoint where monotonic constraints are enforced erroneously. 

Observed method: `xarray/core/combine.py:combine_by_coords`

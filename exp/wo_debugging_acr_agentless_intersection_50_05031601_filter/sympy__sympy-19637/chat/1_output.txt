To resolve the issue with `kernS` in the SymPy project, I need to investigate the implementation of the `kernS` function. Since the issue suggests that there is a problem with a local variable `kern` referenced before assignment, it is crucial to review the source code of the `kernS` function. 

I will proceed by searching for the `kernS` method within the SymPy codebase, as the file path is not specified in the provided information.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("kernS")
```

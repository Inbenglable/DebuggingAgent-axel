Reviewing the patch and test outputs, here are the observations:

1. **Patch Analysis**:
   - The proposed patch modifies the `resolve_lookup_value` method in the Django code. The patch changes the behavior such that the resolved value retains the same iterable type as the input. This directly addresses the issue reported, where lists were being coerced into tuples.

2. **Test Output Analysis**:
   - Both `ORIGINAL OUTPUT` and `PATCHED OUTPUT` indicate an `AttributeError`, specifically pointing to the absence of `PickledField` in `django.db.models`.
   - This error occurs before the patch can be tested since the setup fails due to the absence of the `PickledField`. The `AttributeError` suggests that `PickledField` is not available or incorrectly imported/used.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The patch itself seems to correctly address the described issue with coercion if the feature can be tested.
   - However, the test does not run successfully to verify the patch implementation due to the missing `PickledField`.
   - The true resolution of the issue cannot be determined from the test outputs provided, as the test setup needs correction before the patch's effectiveness can be tested.

Given the incomplete test execution (due to configuration/setup error rather than patch functionality), the issue resolution status is:

Issue resolved: `False`

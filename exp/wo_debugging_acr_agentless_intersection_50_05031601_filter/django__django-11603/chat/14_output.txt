To resolve the issue of adding `DISTINCT` support for `Avg` and `Sum` aggregates in Django, we need to modify their respective classes to allow the use of the `DISTINCT` functionality. This involves setting the `allow_distinct` attribute to `True` in both classes, which are subclasses of `Aggregate`.

Here's the patch in the SEARCH/REPLACE format to achieve this:

```pythony
### django/db/models/aggregates.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):
=======
class Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):
    allow_distinct = True
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```pythony
### django/db/models/aggregates.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):
=======
class Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):
    allow_distinct = True
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The JSON representation of the patch is as follows:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):\n=======\nclass Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):\n=======\nclass Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

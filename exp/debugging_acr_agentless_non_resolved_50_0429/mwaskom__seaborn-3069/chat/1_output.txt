Based on the information and traceback provided, the issue described in the test seems to be originating from the behavior of `catplot` when a nominal scale is used. The main error occurs in the `check_nominal_scale_behavior` function, which expects the nominal scale to have tick marks positioned at `-0.5` and `len(data['category']) - 0.5`, which is not happening.

The test code shows that it uses `sns.catplot` to create a bar plot and then inspects the x-axis ticks and limits, expecting them to have some offset (`+/- 0.5`) beyond the first and last category. This is the current area of failure, represented by the `AssertionError`.

The error trace leads us to the `seaborn.categorical.catplot` method, and specifically, the logic behind nominal scale handling when using a categorical plot type. This indicates that the approach in this method, or the objects involved (like `_CategoricalPlotter`), might be where the discrepancy occurs with how seaborn's categorical plots handle scale drawing.

Therefore, I will focus on the `catplot` functionality further and the corresponding plotting mechanisms, particularly `_BarPlotter` given its explicit use in the trace.

Observed method: `seaborn/categorical.py:_BarPlotter`

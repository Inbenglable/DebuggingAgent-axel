To address the issue where an empty `__all__` attribute is ignored by autodoc, I need to confirm the implementation details for handling `__all__` in the `filter_members` method within the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file. Since I already have the `filter_members` function code, I need to ensure that `__all__` filtering logic is appropriately applied when `__all__` is empty. I will check whether there are any specific conditions related to `__all__` in the autodoc module.

Given the current function's complexity and since `__all__` is a significant aspect previously often overlooked in this `filter_members` process, I will perform a final check to identify any other parts of the module that deal specifically with `__all__`.

```python
search_code_in_file("sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py", "__all__")
```

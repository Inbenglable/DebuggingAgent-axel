To resolve the issue, we need to modify the migration logic when adding a nullable `OneToOneField` with a unique constraint in SQLite. Since we are dealing specifically with the migration alteration under SQLite backend, it would be necessary to check the code related to handling SQLite migrations in the Django codebase, especially how nullable unique columns are handled. 

I am going to search for the related migration logic or classes in the Django codebase that would handle this kind of situation. Likely places to look at are the migration operations, particularly `AddField`, and any SQLite-specific backend code dealing with migrations.

Let's search for the `AddField` method in the Django project's related migration files.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("AddField")
search_class_in_codebase("SQLite")
```

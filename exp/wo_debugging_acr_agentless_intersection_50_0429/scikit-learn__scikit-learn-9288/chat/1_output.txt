To resolve the issue, I need to understand the internal workings of the `KMeans` clustering method. Specifically, I need to ensure that the parallel execution logic produces consistent results regardless of the number of jobs. For this, I will retrieve the source code of the `KMeans` class, especially its `fit` method where the parallel execution logic likely resides.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("KMeans")
search_method_in_file("sklearn/cluster/_kmeans.py", "fit")
```

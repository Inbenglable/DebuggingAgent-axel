Upon analyzing the API returned content, I am seeking the specific implementation of the `_latex` method for the `Subs` class in the Sympy codebase. This means I need to find an occurrence directly related to the `Subs` class. Unfortunately, none of the results seem to be specifically associated with the `Subs` class or hint at handling expressions in a way similar to how Subs might be formatted in LaTeX.

Thus, none of the API results directly pertain to the `_latex` method for the `Subs` class that I need to address the parenthesis issue as outlined in the problem statement. Therefore, none of the results is relevant for resolving this specific issue.

I should consider searching further into the Sympy codebase, potentially looking into modules related to symbolic representation or standard mathematical operators which might handle Subs printing in LaTeX. Alternatively, analyzing the calls made to LaTeX formatting functions within high-level printing functionalities could also narrow down the location of the required function.

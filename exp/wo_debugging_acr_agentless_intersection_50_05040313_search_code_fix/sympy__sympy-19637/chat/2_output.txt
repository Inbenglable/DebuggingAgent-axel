The issue arises due to the variable `kern` being referenced before it's assigned. The solution involves ensuring that `kern` is always initialized before it is potentially referenced, preventing the `UnboundLocalError`.

I've retrieved the entire code block for the `kernS` method. Let's analyze the issue:

1. `kern` is assigned only if there is a space in `s` and a subsequent check `if ' ' in s:` is true. However, `hit = kern in s` can be attempted later, even if `' '` was never found in `s` and thus `kern` was never initialized.

2. We need to modify the code to ensure `kern` is initialized regardless of whether spaces exist in `s` or set a default value for `kern` at the beginning, even if the `if ' ' in s:` condition isn't met.

Now, since the source code has already been reviewed thoroughly for `kernS`, I can proceed to provide the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

The patch modifies the `fit_predict` method to ensure it returns results that are consistent with the `predict` method in the `GaussianMixture` class. By changing the return statement in the relevant method to use `self.predict(X)`, both `fit_predict` and `predict` methods share the same internal logic and use the same computed model parameters, especially when `n_init > 1`, which resolves the discrepancy observed earlier.

### Test Output Analysis:
- **Original Output:** 
  - For `n_init = 5`, `Arrays equal: False`, indicating an inconsistency between `fit_predict` and `predict`.

- **Patched Output:** 
  - For `n_init = 5`, `Arrays equal: True`, indicating that the inconsistency has been resolved.

### Conclusion:
The issue was caused by differing model parameters used in `fit_predict` and `predict`, particularly when `n_init > 1`. The patch ensures that `fit_predict` retrieves labels that are consistent with those predicted by `predict`, addressing the bug as per the initial issue description.

Therefore, given the changes and the test outputs, the issue is indeed resolved.

Issue resolved: `True`

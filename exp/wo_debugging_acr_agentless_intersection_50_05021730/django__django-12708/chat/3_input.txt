## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Migration crashes deleting an index_together if there is a unique_together on the same fields
Description
	
Happens with Django 1.11.10
Steps to reproduce:
1) Create models with 2 fields, add 2 same fields to unique_together and to index_together
2) Delete index_together -> Fail
It will fail at django/db/backends/base/schema.py, line 378, in _delete_composed_index(), ValueError: Found wrong number (2) of constraints for as this one will find two constraints, the _uniq and the _idx one. No way to get out of this...
The worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the "new" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.
I think there are 2 different points here:
1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together
2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation

In the previous round, you called search APIs to retrieve relevant source code that would help identify the root cause of the issue and generate a patch. However, the code you retrieved appears in multiple locations (maybe some are irrelevant but have same key). So now your task is to determine which of the retrieved contents are indeed you need, and filter out the irrelevant ones.
This is your API invocation round output:
To address this issue, I need to gather more context about how the `_delete_composed_index` method is used within the rest of Django's codebase and how model constraints, index_together, and unique_together are defined and managed. This will help me determine how to handle the deletion of indexes when they conflict with unique constraints as described in the issue.

Next, I'll search for relevant classes and methods handling these model options and constraints to adjust the migration handling appropriately.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/options.py", "Options")
search_method_in_codebase("_constraint_names")
search_method_in_codebase("execute")
search_code_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "indexes")
search_code_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "constraints")
```

These searches will help me gather information on how Django handles indexes and constraints associated with model migrations, which is crucial for crafting a patch to resolve the issue described.

Among the API returned contents, there may be some irrelevant ones or not. So now you need to analyze each returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.
Now, please first analyze the API returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.

Then you need to choose you needed ones with the following format:
```
FILE_PATH_1:NAME_1
FILE_PATH_2:NAME_2

```

Note:
1. The value of FILE_PATH:NAME, must consistent with the API returned content (but remove the prefix ####).
2. You may select one or more contents, or even all of them if they are indeed you need.

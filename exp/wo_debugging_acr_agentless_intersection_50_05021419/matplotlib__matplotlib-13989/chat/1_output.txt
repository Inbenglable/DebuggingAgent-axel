The issue at hand is with the `plt.hist` function of the `matplotlib` library, specifically when the `density=True` parameter is used along with a specified `range`. The problem is that the returned bins do not respect the specified range in the same way they do when `density=False`.

To resolve this, I need to examine the source code of the `hist` function to identify the root cause of this discrepancy.

I will search for the `hist` method in the `matplotlib` codebase since the precise file location was not provided.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("hist")
```

To address the issue, I need to examine how the `Meta.ordering` interacts with the `GROUP BY` clause in the existing query construction logic. This likely involves the `Query` class, particularly focusing on methods related to grouping or including fields in the SQL statement. I have already identified the `Query` class, but for a more targeted approach, I need to look at the `set_group_by` method within this class to understand how grouping is being applied.

Let's retrieve the source code for the `set_group_by` method in the `Query` class.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/sql/query.py", "set_group_by")
```

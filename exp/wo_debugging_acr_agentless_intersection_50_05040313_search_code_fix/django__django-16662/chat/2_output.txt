To address the issue, we need to look into the `MigrationWriter` class located in `django/db/migrations/writer.py`. It is likely that the method responsible for writing the migration file is named `as_string`, which would include the generation of import statements.

To proceed, I need to retrieve the source code of the `MigrationWriter.as_string` method to understand how import statements are generated and to implement the necessary changes.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/writer.py", "MigrationWriter.as_string")
```

The observed code snippet in `_cstack` is responsible for constructing the `cleft` and `cright` matrices, which are used to create the separability matrix for the compound model. The issue arises because these matrices are not being computed correctly for the expected behavior of nested models.

### Analysis of the Observed Code:
1. **Initialization of `cleft` and `cright`:**
   - `cleft` is initialized as a zero matrix with dimensions `(noutp, left.shape[1])` and populated with the `left` transformation's separability matrix in its top-left corner.
   - `cright` is similarly initialized and populated with ones in its bottom-right corner.

2. **Incorrect Handling for Nested Models:**
   - When models have nested structures, the above logic of placing elements in `cleft` and `cright` does not respect the expected separability, which requires proper indexing or placement that considers the nesting. The stacking of these matrices does not correctly establish separability for the combined structure.

Given this unexpected behavior, the issue is likely related to how the matrices are constructed, particularly how they are initialized and filled with the existing data from `left` and `right`.

With these insights, I can conclude that the logical issue lies within this `_cstack` method. It does not properly handle the complexities of nested compound model matrices.

Thus, I can pinpoint the buggy method:

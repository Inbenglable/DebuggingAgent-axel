To resolve this issue, I need to retrieve the source code of the `Contains.as_set` method to understand how it's currently implemented and make necessary adjustments. This method is located in the file `sympy/sets/contains.py`.

Therefore, I will proceed to retrieve the source code for the `Contains.as_set` method.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/sets/contains.py", "Contains.as_set")
```

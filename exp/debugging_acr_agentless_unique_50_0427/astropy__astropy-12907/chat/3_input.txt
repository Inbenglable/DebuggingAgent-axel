Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **astropy** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Modeling's `separability_matrix` does not compute separability correctly for nested CompoundModels
Consider the following model:

```python
from astropy.modeling import models as m
from astropy.modeling.separable import separability_matrix

cm = m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)
```

It's separability matrix as you might expect is a diagonal:

```python
>>> separability_matrix(cm)
array([[ True, False],
       [False,  True]])
```

If I make the model more complex:
```python
>>> separability_matrix(m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5))
array([[ True,  True, False, False],
       [ True,  True, False, False],
       [False, False,  True, False],
       [False, False, False,  True]])
```

The output matrix is again, as expected, the outputs and inputs to the linear models are separable and independent of each other.

If however, I nest these compound models:
```python
>>> separability_matrix(m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm)
array([[ True,  True, False, False],
       [ True,  True, False, False],
       [False, False,  True,  True],
       [False, False,  True,  True]])
```
Suddenly the inputs and outputs are no longer separable?

This feels like a bug to me, but I might be missing something?

This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
In analyzing the information provided, we have a test case that exposes an issue with the `separability_matrix` function. The separability matrix is expected to identify independent and separable inputs and outputs in models, but when applied to a nested compound model, the output is not as expected from the test.

The key issue is that when a model is nested, it seems to fail in computing separability correctly, showing dependency where there should be independence. The output array suggests that it treats all outputs of the `Pix2Sky_TAN` component as affecting all the inputs of the `Linear1D` components, which is incorrect.

In addressing this, we can trace the flow and logic within the `separability_matrix` function located in "astropy/modeling/separable.py" to determine where it incorrectly evaluates model separability in nested structures.

Therefore, the next step is to look more closely into the separability analysis logic specifically within this function to understand why it fails to evaluate nested models correctly.

Observed method: `astropy/modeling/separable.py:separability_matrix`
==================================================
Based on the information from the provided tracing and analysis, the discrepancy in separability computation arises in the `separability_matrix` function. The observed behavior suggests nested models are not being evaluated independently as expected, likely indicating an issue in the logic determining separability in nested CompoundModels.

As per the runtime tracing, the `separable_matrix` is created by calling a function named `_separable(transform)` and returned as a boolean matrix. The trace shows the `separable_matrix` calculation and its conversion to a boolean matrix by setting non-zero values to `True` at line 101.

To find the root cause of the issue, we need to inspect the internal logic of the `_separable` function, as that is where the actual matrix is calculated. This part seems to be incorrectly handling nested transformations by not maintaining the expected independence of outputs relative to inputs when models are nested.

Therefore, I need to observe the behavior inside the `_separable` function to understand how it's computing the separability for nested CompoundModels. By analyzing this, I will be able to identify why it does not compute the separability correctly.

Please provide the scope of the `_separable` function so I can trace the internal logic and determine where the computation goes awry.

Observed scope: `astropy/modeling/separable.py:100-101`
==================================================


Now you choose separability_matrix's code snippet 
   100	    separable_matrix = _separable(transform)
   101	    separable_matrix = np.where(separable_matrix != 0, True, False)

for further observation, tracing the abnormal program behavior.

This is the runtime information of the code snippet you choose to observed in separability_matrix:

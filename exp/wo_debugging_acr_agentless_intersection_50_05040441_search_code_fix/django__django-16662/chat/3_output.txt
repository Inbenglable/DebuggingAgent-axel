I'm not yet ready to generate the patch. I need to retrieve additional source code to identify the specific part of the codebase responsible for generating migration files, particularly where the import statements are organized. This is crucial to implement the fix to ensure imports follow Django's coding style and isort defaults.

I will begin the search for relevant methods in the codebase related to migration generation.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("create_migration")
search_method_in_codebase("MigrationCreator")
```

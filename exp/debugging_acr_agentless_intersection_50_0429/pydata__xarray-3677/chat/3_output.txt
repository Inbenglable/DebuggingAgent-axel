To resolve the issue, I need to examine the source code of the `dataset_merge_method` in `xarray/core/merge.py`, since that's where the error is occurring when trying to merge a `DataArray` with a `Dataset`. Let's go ahead and retrieve the code for the `dataset_merge_method`.

```python
search_method_in_file("xarray/core/merge.py", "dataset_merge_method")
```

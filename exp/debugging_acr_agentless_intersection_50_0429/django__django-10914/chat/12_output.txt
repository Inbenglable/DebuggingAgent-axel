To determine if the issue described in the Django project is resolved, let's analyze the patch and the outputs from running the test before and after applying the patch.

### Patch Review
The proposed patch modifies `django/core/files/storage.py`, specifically the code handling files with a `temporary_file_path`. The patch adds a line to change the file permission with `os.chmod(full_path, self.file_permissions_mode)` if `self.file_permissions_mode` is set. This is intended to ensure that uploaded files have the specified default permissions.

### Test Output Analysis

#### Original Output
Before applying the patch, the test failed with an `AssertionError`, indicating that the file permissions obtained (0o600) did not match the expected permissions (0o644). This reflects the problem mentioned in the issue: when using `TemporaryUploadedFile`, the file ends up with more restrictive permissions than intended.

#### Patched Output
After applying the patch, the test output is identical to the original output. The `AssertionError` still shows that the permissions are 0o600 instead of the expected 0o644. Therefore, the patch did not resolve the issue.

### Conclusion
The test results indicate that the patch did not fix the problem with file permissions for uploads using `TemporaryUploadedFile`. The permissions remained incorrect (0o600), failing to meet the expected permissions of 0o644.

Issue resolved: `False`

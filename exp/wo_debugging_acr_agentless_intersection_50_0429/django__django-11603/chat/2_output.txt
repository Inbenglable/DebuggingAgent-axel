To generate a patch for adding DISTINCT support to the `Avg` and `Sum` aggregates, I need to examine the source code of these classes more closely. Specifically, I need to understand how the `Aggregate` class manages or could manage a DISTINCT clause, as the `Avg` and `Sum` classes inherit from it.

Given that the `Aggregate` class is crucial for this understanding, I need to retrieve its source code. Here's how I will proceed:

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Aggregate")
```
This will help me understand how to implement the DISTINCT functionality properly within the `Avg` and `Sum` classes.

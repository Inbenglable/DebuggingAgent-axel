Observing the issue description, error traceback, and test output, we can suspect that the issue originates during the culling process in the `_cull` method from `django/core/cache/backends/db.py`.

The traceback in the issue directly identifies `/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/django/core/cache/backends/db.py:277â†’ _cull`. Based on the test provided, this method is likely involved during the cache set operation when culling should occur because the cache size exceeds `MAX_ENTRIES`.

Let's focus on tracing the behavior of the `_cull` method to identify the root cause of the 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable error.
  
Observed method: `django/core/cache/backends/db.py:BaseDatabaseCache._cull`

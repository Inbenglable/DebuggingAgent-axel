To fix the issue with the `fowlkes_mallows_score` function, we need to update the calculation to handle large integer values. The suggestion is to modify the line:

```python
return tk / np.sqrt(pk * qk) if tk != 0. else 0.
```

to:

```python
return np.sqrt(tk / pk) * np.sqrt(tk / qk) if tk != 0. else 0.
```

To proceed, I need to locate and understand the existing implementation of the `fowlkes_mallows_score` function in the scikit-learn codebase. Let's search for this method.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("fowlkes_mallows_score")
```

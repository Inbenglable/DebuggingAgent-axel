You are a PR reviewer that needs to review the patch generated by a bug repair agent and determine whether the issue is fixed or not.
This is the bug issue, which is in the **sympy** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
SI._collect_factor_and_dimension() cannot properly detect that exponent is dimensionless
How to reproduce:

```python
from sympy import exp
from sympy.physics import units
from sympy.physics.units.systems.si import SI

expr = units.second / (units.ohm * units.farad)
dim = SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(expr)[1]

assert SI.get_dimension_system().is_dimensionless(dim)

buggy_expr = 100 + exp(expr)
SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(buggy_expr)

# results in ValueError: Dimension of "exp(second/(farad*ohm))" is Dimension(time/(capacitance*impedance)), but it should be Dimension(1)
```

The repair agent has tried to generate a patch to fix the issue:
## PATCH CONTEXT
<PATCH_CONTEXT>
To resolve the issue with `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension()`, we need to address how dimensionless checks are performed, particularly for functions like `exp()`. The problem arises because the exponent doesn't get correctly interpreted as dimensionless, leading to a `ValueError`. 

We should add a specific check for functions whose parameters should always be dimensionless. The `Function` handling within `_collect_factor_and_dimension()` should be adjusted to ensure this.

Here's the patch:

```pythony
### sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        elif isinstance(expr, Function):
            fds = [self._collect_factor_and_dimension(
                arg) for arg in expr.args]
            return (expr.func(*(f[0] for f in fds)),
                    *(d[1] for d in fds))
=======
        elif isinstance(expr, Function):
            fds = [self._collect_factor_and_dimension(
                arg) for arg in expr.args]
            # Ensure that all function arguments are dimensionless,
            # which is especially important for mathematical functions like exp.
            for arg_factor, arg_dim in fds:
                if expr.func in (exp,):
                    if not self.get_dimension_system().is_dimensionless(arg_dim):
                        raise ValueError(
                            f"Argument of '{expr.func.__name__}' must be dimensionless, "
                            f"but the dimension of '{arg_factor}' is '{arg_dim}'"
                        )
            return (expr.func(*(f[0] for f in fds)),
                    Dimension(1))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This modification adds a dimension check specifically for functions like `exp`. If any argument of these functions is not dimensionless, it raises a `ValueError` which should include a more explanatory message. Thus, it resolves the issue and aligns with expected behavior that certain mathematical functions can only be computed on dimensionless quantities.

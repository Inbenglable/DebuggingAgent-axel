After reviewing the patch and analyzing the test output before and after applying the patch, we can determine whether the issue has been resolved.

### Patch Analysis:
The proposed patch modifies the logic in the `__init__` method of the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass to handle properties in addition to functions. It introduces functionality to:
- Determine if an attribute is either a function or a property.
- Handle property docstring inheritance by setting the docstring from the superclass's corresponding property using setters and deleters.

### Test Output Analysis:
- **Original Output:** The test fails with an `AssertionError` because the docstring for `Derived.prop` is not inherited, indicating the original issue.
  
- **Patched Output:** The test output is identical to the original output, with the same `AssertionError`, demonstrating that the patch did not resolve the issue. 

### Conclusion:
The patch was intended to extend docstring inheritance capabilities to properties within the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass in the Astropy project. However, the test results indicate that the intended functionality to inherit docstrings for properties was not successful, as the docstring for the `Derived.prop` property remains uninherited, causing the test to fail.

Issue resolved: `False`

The `_cstack` function is primarily responsible for combining the separation matrices of two components. It stacks these matrices horizontally, which corresponds to the '&' operation. The method uses `_compute_n_outputs` to determine the number of outputs, and `_coord_matrix` to obtain the separation matrix for each component.

### Analysis:
1. The test results indicate that `_cstack` does not handle nested models correctly. The final separation matrix should maintain independence between components in nested models, which is not happening; instead, all outputs of nested models are being combined as dependent.

2. **Runtime Information**:
   - When processing nested compound models, `_cstack` fails to create a correct separability matrix. This is observed in the test results for Test 3: Nested compound model.
   - The final matrix incorrectly groups the outputs as dependent, indicated by `[False, False, True, True]` instead of showing them as independent.

3. **Potential Issue**: The way `_cstack` constructs `cleft` and `cright` matrices for left and right components respectively, might result in the incorrect merging of separability matrices, especially when handling nested matrices. The logic for filling in these matrices appears fundamentally incorrect for nested structures.

Since the current understanding points towards the `_cstack` method and its core logic when handling columns and rows for nested compound models, and because runtime data already suggests faulty behavior, the root cause is likely residing within `_cstack`.

**Conclusion**:
I believe the issue is directly related to `_cstack`'s handling of nested compound models, suggesting an incorrect matrix consolidation approach. Therefore, the buggy method is:

The issue appears to stem from improper relative linking within the SVG inheritance diagrams for files not located in the root directory. The problem likely lies in how the `sphinx.ext.inheritance_diagram` extension generates these links in the SVG format.

To begin tracing this behavior, we should examine how the inheritance diagrams are generated, particularly focusing on the section of code responsible for constructing the links within the SVG images.

Let's start by observing the method responsible for generating the inheritance diagrams. This is likely within the `sphinx.ext.inheritance_diagram` extension.

Observed method: `sphinx/ext/inheritance_diagram.py:InheritanceDiagram.run`

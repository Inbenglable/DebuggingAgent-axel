Based on the issue description, it involves modifying the `django.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments` function to use a different method to determine if Python was launched with the `-m` argument. I need to examine the source code of this specific function.

I'll proceed as follows:

```python
search_method_in_codebase("get_child_arguments")
```

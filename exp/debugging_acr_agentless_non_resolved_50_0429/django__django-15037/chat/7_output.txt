To address this issue, I need to retrieve the source code for the `handle_inspection` method within the `django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py` file. This method contains the logic where foreign keys are processed and potentially needs modification to correctly handle foreign keys referencing non-primary unique fields.

Let's proceed with retrieving the source code for this method:

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py", "Command.handle_inspection")
```

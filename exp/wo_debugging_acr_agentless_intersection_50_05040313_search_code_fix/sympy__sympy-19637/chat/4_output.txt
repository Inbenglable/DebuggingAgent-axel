The patch changes involve initializing the `kern` variable in the `kernS` function. The line `kern = '_'` is added immediately after the line `hit = False`. This initialization ensures that `kern` is defined before it's referenced later in the function.

### Analysis:

1. **Original Test Output:**
   - The original output indicates an `UnboundLocalError` because `kern` is referenced before it has been assigned any value. This happens specifically on line 516 of `sympy/core/sympify.py` when `hit = kern in s` is executed.

2. **Patch:**
   - The patch addresses this issue by initializing `kern` with the value `_` right after `hit = False`. This ensures that `kern` always has a value before it's referenced.

3. **Patched Test Output:**
   - The patched output is empty, which means that the test did not trigger any exceptions. This suggests that the `UnboundLocalError` was resolved, and the code executed without encountering the previous error.

Given the analysis, the patch successfully resolves the issue of `kern` being referenced before assignment. Thus, based on the provided patched output and the absence of errors, the issue appears to be resolved.

**Issue resolved: `True`**

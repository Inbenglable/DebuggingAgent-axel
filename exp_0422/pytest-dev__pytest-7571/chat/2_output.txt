The provided test script consists of two tests: `test_foo` and `test_bar`. The issue arises because `caplog.set_level(42)` modifies the log handler's level to 42 in `test_foo`. The expectation, as per the documentation, is that the log level should automatically reset to its original level after `test_foo` completes. However, in `test_bar`, the log level is not reset; it remains 42, leading to a test failure due to the expectation that it should be the default level (`logging.NOTSET`).

The error `NameError: name 'logging' is not defined` in the traceback indicates a missing import statement, which needs to be addressed for the assertion to check the log level against `logging.NOTSET`. However, this is secondary to the main functional issue, which is the log level not being reset correctly between tests.

The primary task is to identify where in the pytest codebase the caplog fixture should be restoring the log levels, and why it's failing to do so. The abnormal behavior can be traced to the mechanism responsible for resetting the log level in the caplog fixture.

Next, we will trace the `caplog` fixture's behavior to understand why the log level is not being restored between tests.

Observed method: `src/_pytest/logging.py:LogCaptureFixture.handler`

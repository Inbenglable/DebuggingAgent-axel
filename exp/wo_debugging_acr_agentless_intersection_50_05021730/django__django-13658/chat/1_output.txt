To resolve the issue described, I need to examine the `ManagementUtility` class and specifically its `__init__` method. This code is likely part of Django's management command infrastructure. I will locate this class and method in the codebase so that I can make the necessary changes.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ManagementUtility")
search_method_in_codebase("ManagementUtility.__init__")
```

The observed method `UnifiedReadWriteMethod.__get__` seems to function simply as a getter, retrieving a method or property during the writing process. The current traceback shows an assertion error, but it's related to a file path issue and not directly related to the bug described. 

To diagnose why the `formats` argument is ignored, we need to investigate further into the `write()` process when using the HTML format. The `write()` function should apply the format transformations specified to the data. Since the getter didn’t yield any information on why that transformation isn’t happening, it would be prudent to check where the format application occurs in the writing process.

Let's deepen the observation by investigating the writing mechanism further. If the `write()` method is responsible for calling the format functions, then we need to look within its scope.

Observed scope: `astropy/io/ascii/core.py:{RELEVANT_WRITE_METHOD_START}-{RELEVANT_WRITE_METHOD_END}`

Please replace `{RELEVANT_WRITE_METHOD_START}` and `{RELEVANT_WRITE_METHOD_END}` with the actual line numbers of the method responsible for writing data in the HTML format in `astropy/io/ascii/core.py`. This should provide insights into why the `formats` argument is being ignored specifically for HTML outputs.

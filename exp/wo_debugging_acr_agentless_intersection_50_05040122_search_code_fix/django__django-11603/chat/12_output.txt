The issue appears to be related to adding DISTINCT support for the Avg and Sum aggregates in Django, as the test cases aim to reproduce this issue. The patch correctly modifies the `django/db/models/aggregates.py` file by adding the `allow_distinct` attribute set to `True` for the Avg and Sum classes, which aligns with the approach used for the Count aggregate class.

However, evaluating the test outputs before and after the patch application reveals that the issue has not been fixed. Both outputs show the same error traceback:

```
django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet.
```

The error indicates a problem with the test setup rather than with the patch itself, which means that neither the original nor the patched code is being correctly tested due to improper application initialization. This error needs to be addressed in the test setup code so that the patch's effectiveness can be accurately assessed.

Since the test outputs before and after the patch remain unchanged due to this setup error, it is impossible to conclude whether the patch resolves the original issue regarding DISTINCT support for Avg and Sum aggregates.

Issue resolved: `False`

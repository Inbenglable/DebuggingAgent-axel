To address the issue with the `add_fields` method in Django's formsets, we need to modify the condition to include a check to see if the `index` is not `None`. Here is the patch in the SEARCH/REPLACE format to fix the issue:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/forms/formsets.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or index < initial_form_count):\n=======\n        if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or (index is not None and index < initial_form_count)):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

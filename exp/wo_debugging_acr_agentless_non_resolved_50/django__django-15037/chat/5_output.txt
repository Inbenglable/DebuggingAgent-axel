Based on the information retrieved, I've obtained the source code for the `Command.get_field_type` and `Command.handle_inspection` methods from `django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py`. The primary issue involves how `inspectdb` processes foreign keys, ensuring that they reference specific fields rather than defaulting to the primary key.

To resolve this, I should be prepared to modify how relationships are detected in the `handle_inspection` method, possibly using the detected constraints to differentiate which specific fields the foreign keys should reference. This means looking into how constraints and relations are currently processed and modifying the logic to account for the specific field targeted by the foreign key.

Since I've examined the necessary parts of the codebase to address the foreign key handling in the `inspectdb` process, I'm ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

Based on the code for `TruncDate` and `TruncTime`, I need to examine the implementation of the `TimeZone` mixin in the `datetime.py` file to understand its intended behavior regarding timezone handling. This will help us determine how to integrate `tzinfo` parameter effectively.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TimeZone")
```

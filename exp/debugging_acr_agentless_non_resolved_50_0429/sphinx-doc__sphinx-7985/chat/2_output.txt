Based on the runtime information and the code snippet provided for the `CheckExternalLinksBuilder.get_outdated_docs` method, we can see that the function simply returns `self.env.found_docs`. This method isn't directly related to checking links but rather indicates which documents have changed and thus need to be processed again. This information alone does not help us directly in resolving the issue at hand, which concerns checking local (internal) links through the `linkcheck` builder.

The issue here seems to arise from the `linkcheck` builder's lack of capability to check local links, as revealed in the original problem description and testing output: the test appears to be passing in this context, but that means it correctly identifies remote links and local links at some level.

A deeper inspection is necessary to understand the part of the code responsible for scanning and validating internal links, specifically local (relative) links, as this part does not currently report broken local links in the issue described.

To address this, we should trace how links are processed within the builder beyond just marking outdated documents; hence, I will follow the path concerning link processing logic.

Observed scope: `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py:100-150`

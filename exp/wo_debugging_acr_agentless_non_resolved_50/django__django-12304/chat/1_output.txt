To resolve the issue in the Django project where enumeration types are not usable in templates, we need to modify the Choices classes to include the attribute `do_not_call_in_templates = True`. These classes are likely part of Django's choices module or related modules.

First, I need to identify the correct file and class related to enumeration types, specifically the `Choices` classes, to add this attribute. I'll use the search functionalities to find the necessary source code for these classes.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Choices")
search_class_in_codebase("ChoiceEnum")
search_class_in_codebase("IntegerChoices")
search_class_in_codebase("TextChoices")
search_class_in_codebase("ChoicesMeta")
```

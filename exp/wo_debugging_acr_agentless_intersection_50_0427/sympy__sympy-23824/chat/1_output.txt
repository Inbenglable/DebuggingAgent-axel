To proceed, I need to retrieve the source code for the `kahane_simplify` function in the SymPy codebase, as it is crucial to identify where the bug related to the incorrect order of gamma matrices resides.

Since the file path for `kahane_simplify` is not provided, I'll search for the method in the whole project codebase. 

```python
search_method_in_codebase("kahane_simplify")
```

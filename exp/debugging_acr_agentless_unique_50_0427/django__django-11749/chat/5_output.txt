Analyzing the current observed code snippet in `django/core/management/__init__.py`, along with the abnormal program behavior, it appears that the root cause is indeed related to handling required mutually exclusive groups with `call_command`. The error message arises because the code constructing the `parse_args` doesn't account for mutually exclusive groups correctly. Instead, it checks for the `opt.required` attribute without considering whether the arguments belong to a required mutually exclusive group, leading to the faulty behavior when calling the command with kwargs.

The snippet between lines 114-138 shows that required arguments are processed and added to `parse_args`. However, mutually exclusive groups are not given special handling, resulting in the `CommandError`:

```python
135    parse_args += [
136        '{}={}'.format(min(opt.option_strings), arg_options[opt.dest])
137        for opt in parser_actions if opt.required and opt.dest in options
138    ]
```

The logic incorrectly assumes `opt.dest in options` should be directly mapped based on `opt.required`, without considering group constraints. Hence, the mutually exclusive options aren't handled appropriately, leading to unexpected behavior and errors.

Now let's continue tracing to find the exact logic related to the mutually exclusive group's handling, which is likely missed or incorrect within the tracing so far:

To address the issue where the `add_fields` method fails when the `index` is `None`, we need to modify the condition that compares `index` with `initial_form_count`. Let's implement the required patch to fix this bug.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/forms/formsets.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or index < initial_form_count):\n=======\n        if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or (index is not None and index < initial_form_count)):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

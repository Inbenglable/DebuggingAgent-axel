## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Add DISTINCT support for Avg and Sum aggregates.
Description
	
As an extension of #28658, aggregates should be supported for other general aggregates such as Avg and Sum. Before 2.2, these aggregations just ignored the parameter, but now throw an exception.
This change would just involve setting these classes as allowing DISTINCT, and could also be applied to Min and Max (although pointless).

</ISSUE>


You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue, I need to analyze the implementation of Avg and Sum aggregates in the Django project, specifically focusing on how DISTINCT is handled. To do so, I need to locate their respective classes and inspect their code. First, I'll search for the location of the Avg and Sum classes within the codebase, and then inspect their implementation.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Avg")
search_class_in_codebase("Sum")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_class_in_codebase("Avg")
RESULT:
#### django/db/models/aggregates.py:Avg
```python
class Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):
    function = 'AVG'
    name = 'Avg'
```


### API INVOKE: search_class_in_codebase("Sum")
RESULT:
#### django/db/models/aggregates.py:Sum
```python
class Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):
    function = 'SUM'
    name = 'Sum'
```


==================================================

Your Output:
```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Avg")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Sum")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Avg")
RESULT:
#### django/db/models/aggregates.py:Avg
```python
class Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):
    function = 'AVG'
    name = 'Avg'
```


### API INVOKE: search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Sum")
RESULT:
#### django/db/models/aggregates.py:Sum
```python
class Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):
    function = 'SUM'
    name = 'Sum'
```


==================================================

Your Output:
To resolve the issue of adding DISTINCT support for Avg and Sum aggregates, I need to examine the implementation details of these classes in the `django/db/models/aggregates.py` file to understand how aggregates currently work and see where to include the DISTINCT handling.

I will retrieve the full source code of the `Avg` and `Sum` classes to investigate further.

search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Avg")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Sum")

Your Output:
Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

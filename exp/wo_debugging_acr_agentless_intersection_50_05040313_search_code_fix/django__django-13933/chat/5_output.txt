Let's analyze the provided information step by step:

### Patch Review

1. **Changes to `ModelChoiceField`:** 
    - Modified the `invalid_choice` error message to include the invalid value by using a placeholder `%(value)s`.
    - Updated how the `ValidationError` is raised by including a `params` dictionary that maps `value` to the actual invalid choice passed.

These changes align the behavior of `ModelChoiceField` with `ModelMultipleChoiceField`, which already displays the invalid value in its error messages.

### Test Output Analysis

1. **Original Output:**
    - The test produces a `ModuleNotFoundError` indicating that the module named 'reproducer' is not found. This error suggests an issue with the setup environment rather than the functionality of the `ModelChoiceField`.

2. **Patched Output:**
    - Even after applying the patch, the same `ModuleNotFoundError` persists, which means the runtime environment issue hasn't been fixed.

### Issue Resolution

The test output indicates that the reproducible test setup itself is flawed due to a missing module (`reproducer`). Therefore, the test isn't accurately verifying whether the original bug was fixed by the patch. Despite the logical correctness of the patch, we cannot conclusively determine if the issue related to the `ModelChoiceField` error messages is resolved because the test does not run due to an environment setup problem.

Based solely on the given test outputs and setup, the issue is unresolved as the environment issue prevents verification of the fix's application.

Issue resolved: `False`

To resolve the issue, I need to modify the code in the `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` file. Specifically, the code line that is causing the `KeyError`. Based on the traceback and the suggested fix, it's clear we need to modify the part where `deconstruction[2]['to']` is being deleted. Let's search for the relevant method in the `autodetector.py` file to ensure we have the required context for the patch.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/autodetector.py", "only_relation_agnostic_fields")
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/autodetector.py", "_detect_changes")
```

Analyzing the debugging information and the reproduction code, we observe that the issue originates from the `merge` function used in the xarray library. Specifically, the problem arises when the merged result's attributes are changed, and this change unexpectedly affects the attributes of one of the source objects. This indicates that the merged dataset's attributes are referencing the original dataset's attributes rather than creating a copy.

Following the observation in the issue report, the problematic behavior arises from the handling of the `combine_attrs='override'` case. Instead of copying the attributes from the first source dataset, they are referenced directly, which leads to the observed unwanted side effects.

The detailed traceback indicates that the issue occurs during the merge process when the function `merge_core` is utilized. Therefore, I will inspect the `merge_core` function to trace how attributes are processed and to confirm the presence of the problematic code.

Observed method: `xarray/core/merge.py:merge_core`

I have obtained the source code for the `MatrixShaping.hstack` method. Before deciding on the patch, I should understand if there are any relevant changes or related parts in the `row_join` method that might have influenced the behavior. I will look for this method in the `Matrix` class or relevant classes in the same file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/matrices/common.py", "row_join")
```

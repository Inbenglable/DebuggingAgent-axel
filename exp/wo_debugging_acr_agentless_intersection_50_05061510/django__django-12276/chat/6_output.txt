In reviewing the patch and the test outputs, let's break down the details:

1. **Patch Review:**
   - The patch modifies the `use_required_attribute` method in the `FileInput` class, changing the logic to consider the `initial` parameter, which is intended to stop the `required` attribute from appearing in the rendered HTML input if initial data is present.
   - The change replaces:
     ```python
     def use_required_attribute(self, initial):
         return not self.is_hidden
     ```
     with:
     ```python
     def use_required_attribute(self, initial):
         return not self.is_hidden and not initial
     ```
   - This correctly addresses the issue described in the bug report, which is to prevent the `required` attribute from being displayed when initial data is present.

2. **Test Output Analysis:**
   - Both the original and patched test outputs show the same error related to the `setup_test_environment()` being called twice, resulting in a `RuntimeError`.
   - This error is unrelated to the logic in the patched code or the bug itself. It seems to be an issue with how the test is set up, rather than reflecting the status of the patch implementation.

3. **Functional Aspect:**
   - Despite the `RuntimeError`, the logic of the patch itself seems correctly implemented based on the requirements of the bug issue. The test setup error makes it impossible to verify the execution of the core logic through the provided test outputs.

Considering the above points, the patch does address the actual issue as described but cannot be confirmed through the test due to setup errors. Hence, based solely on reviewing the patch logic in the context given:

Issue resolved: `True`

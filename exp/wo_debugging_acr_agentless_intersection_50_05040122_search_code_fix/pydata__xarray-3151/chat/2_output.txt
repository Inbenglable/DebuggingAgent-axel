To resolve this issue, I need to review the following helper methods used within the `combine_by_coords` function:

1. `_infer_concat_order_from_coords`: This method likely determines the order and dimensions along which datasets should be concatenated based on their coordinates.
2. `_check_shape_tile_ids`: This method might verify if the shape or structure of datasets is compatible for combination.
3. `_combine_nd`: This method appears to be responsible for the actual combination of datasets along specified dimensions.

Understanding these methods will help determine how to modify `combine_by_coords` to allow for identical non-monotonic coordinates without raising a `ValueError`. I will retrieve their source code.

```python
search_method_in_file("xarray/core/combine.py", "_infer_concat_order_from_coords")
search_method_in_file("xarray/core/combine.py", "_check_shape_tile_ids")
search_method_in_file("xarray/core/combine.py", "_combine_nd")
```

Based on the information presented so far, the issue revolves around integrating the `--skip-checks` argument into Django's management command parsing system. We have observed the `BaseCommand.create_parser` method, which constructs the command's argument parser using `CommandParser`. It already registers several command-specific options like `--version`, `--verbosity`, and others.

### Current Analysis
In the `create_parser` method, custom command-line arguments are added using `parser.add_argument`. To introduce the `--skip-checks` option, we should add it within this method to ensure it's recognized during argument parsing.

### Next Steps
Given that the method for adding arguments is clear from the current scope of `create_parser`, the next logical step is to add the `--skip-checks` argument in this method.

#### Proposed Action
To solve the issue, extend the `create_parser` method by adding an argument for `--skip-checks` using `parser.add_argument`.

Therefore, the buggy method where the modification should be made is:

Buggy method: `django/core/management/base.py:BaseCommand.create_parser`

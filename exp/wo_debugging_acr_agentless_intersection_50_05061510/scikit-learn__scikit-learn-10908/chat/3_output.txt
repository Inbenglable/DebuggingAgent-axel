I have obtained the source code for the methods involved in the issue: `get_feature_names` and `_check_vocabulary`. The `_check_vocabulary` method is responsible for checking whether the vocabulary has been fitted by looking for the `vocabulary_` attribute. Since the issue suggests altering `get_feature_names` to not raise `NotFittedError` when a `vocabulary` parameter is provided, I need to verify the behavior of the vocabulary parameter handling.

To resolve the issue, I need to further explore how the `CountVectorizer` class handles the `vocabulary` argument during initialization and whether it directly influences `vocabulary_`.

```python
search_class_in_file("sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py", "CountVectorizer")
```

To address the issue, we have already retrieved the code for the `unapply_migration` method in the `MigrationExecutor` class, which seems to handle unapplying migrations. We've also obtained the class definition for `MigrationRecorder`, which includes methods for recording applied and unapplied migrations. 

Let's explore further how `record_unapplied` method works in the `MigrationRecorder` to understand its current functionality and how it might need to be adjusted or confirmed for handling squashed migrations. This will help ensure the squashed migration is correctly recorded as unapplied.

I will retrieve the source code for the `record_unapplied` method from the `MigrationRecorder` class.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/recorder.py", "MigrationRecorder.record_unapplied")
```

To analyze the abnormal program behavior, we have established that:

1. The input `"(1,)"` is the source code for a single-element tuple.
2. The output after parsing and unparsing is `"(1)"`, which is incorrect because the comma was removed.
3. The expected output is `"(1,)"`, retaining the comma to denote a single-element tuple.

The discrepancy arises during the unparsing process executed by the `ast.unparse` method.

Given this information, the issue appears to be related to how single-element tuples are handled in the unparser logic. During the parsing process, the input is correctly recognized as an AST for a tuple with one element, but the unparsing is not maintaining the comma in the output string.

Proceeding with the analysis, the next step would be to trace into the `unparse` function as it's responsible for transforming the AST back to string representation.

Observed method: `sphinx/pycode/ast.py:unparse`

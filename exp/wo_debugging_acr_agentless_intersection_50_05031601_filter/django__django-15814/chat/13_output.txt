To address the issue regarding the crash when using `select_related()` and `only()` on proxy models in Django, we'll modify the code in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` to ensure we refer to the concrete model's metadata.

Here's the proposed patch in the required SEARCH/REPLACE format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/sql/query.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                opts = cur_model._meta\n=======\n                opts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This change replaces the line `opts = cur_model._meta` with `opts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta`, ensuring that the code correctly accesses the metadata for the concrete model, thus resolving the issue with proxy models.

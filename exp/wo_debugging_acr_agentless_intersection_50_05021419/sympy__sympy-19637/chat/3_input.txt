Now You need to reolve the following issue in the **sympy** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
kernS: 'kern' referenced before assignment
from sympy.core.sympify import kernS

text = "(2*x)/(x-1)"
expr = kernS(text)  
//  hit = kern in s
// UnboundLocalError: local variable 'kern' referenced before assignment

</ISSUE>


You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue, I need to understand the `kernS` function from the sympy library, which seems to have the error related to the variable `kern` being referenced before it is assigned a value. To proceed, I'll need to retrieve the source code for the `kernS` method. Since I do not have the file path of the method, I will search for the method in the whole project codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("kernS")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("kernS")
RESULT:
#### sympy/core/sympify.py:kernS
```python
def kernS(s):
    """Use a hack to try keep autosimplification from distributing a
    a number into an Add; this modification doesn't
    prevent the 2-arg Mul from becoming an Add, however.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.core.sympify import kernS
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y

    The 2-arg Mul distributes a number (or minus sign) across the terms
    of an expression, but kernS will prevent that:

    >>> 2*(x + y), -(x + 1)
    (2*x + 2*y, -x - 1)
    >>> kernS('2*(x + y)')
    2*(x + y)
    >>> kernS('-(x + 1)')
    -(x + 1)

    If use of the hack fails, the un-hacked string will be passed to sympify...
    and you get what you get.

    XXX This hack should not be necessary once issue 4596 has been resolved.

Your Output:

==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

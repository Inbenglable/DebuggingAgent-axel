To resolve the issue where reserved SQL keywords such as "Order" cause errors due to unquoted SQLite table names, the search/replace patch should ensure that these table names are properly quoted.

Here's the patch in the required format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n'PRAGMA foreign_key_check(%s)' % table_name\n=======\n'PRAGMA foreign_key_check(\"%s\")' % table_name\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n'PRAGMA foreign_key_list(%s)' % table_name\n=======\n'PRAGMA foreign_key_list(\"%s\")' % table_name\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n'SELECT %s, %s FROM %s WHERE rowid = %%s' % (\n=======\n'SELECT %s, %s FROM \"%s\" WHERE rowid = %%s' % (\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n'FROM `%s` as REFERRING\nLEFT JOIN `%s` as REFERRED\n=======\n'FROM \"%s\" as REFERRING\nLEFT JOIN \"%s\" as REFERRED\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch will ensure that table names are properly quoted in SQL statements, preventing syntax errors when using SQL reserved words as table names.

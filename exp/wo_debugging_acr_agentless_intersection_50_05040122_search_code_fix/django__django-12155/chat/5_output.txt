To resolve the issue with the `trim_docstring` function, we need to modify the logic that calculates the indentation to exclude the first line of the docstring while determining the minimum indentation. Here is the patch in the requested format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())\n=======\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

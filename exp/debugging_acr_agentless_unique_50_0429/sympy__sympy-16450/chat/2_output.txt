The observed behavior indicates that the issue arises from the `posify` function within the SymPy library. The function is intended to return a symbol with modified positivity assumptions while maintaining other relevant assumptions like `finite`. However, in the current implementation, the `posify` function replaces the input symbol with a `Dummy` symbol, altering its assumptions, and consequently removing the `finite` assumption.

Upon analyzing the `posify` implementation, the critical part of the code appears to be where symbols are being replaced with `Dummy` symbols. Specifically, the `Dummy` symbols are initialized with a `positive=True` assumption without carrying over any other existing assumptions, such as `finite`.

The replacement in question occurs at line 254:
```python
reps = {s: Dummy(s.name, positive=True)
                for s in eq.free_symbols if s.is_positive is None}
```

As seen, the code only considers `is_positive` and creates new `Dummy` symbols accordingly. There is no provision for preserving other assumptions like `finite`.

To address the problem, modifications to this line will likely be required to include the preservation of such additional assumptions.

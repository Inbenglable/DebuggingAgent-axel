Based on the analysis, the issue lies in the behavior of the `escape` function within the file `django/utils/html.py`. The function uses a translation table (`_html_escapes`) to manually escape HTML-unsafe characters. The test reveals that the handling of single quotes using this approach (`&#39;`) differs from the standard library's `html.escape` approach (`&#x27;`).

Given the request to replace `django.utils.html.escape()` with the standard `html.escape()`, we should utilize `html.escape` directly within the `escape` function, as it would:
1. Be faster.
2. Align with the standard behavior.

The buggy method where the necessary changes should be made has already been identified:

Buggy method: `django/utils/html.py:escape`

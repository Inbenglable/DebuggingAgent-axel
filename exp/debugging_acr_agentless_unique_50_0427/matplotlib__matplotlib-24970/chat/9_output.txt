Upon reviewing the provided information:

1. **Patch Analysis:**
   - The patch introduces explicit casting of out-of-bound integer assignments to the `xa` array in `matplotlib/colors.py` to the correct data type. This approach aims to handle deprecation warnings due to conversions that won't be supported in future versions of NumPy.

2. **Test Output Comparison:**
   - **Original Output:** Deprecation warnings are observed when running the test with NumPy 1.24.
   - **Patched Output:** The deprecation warnings remain present in the output even after applying the patch.

The evidence suggests that despite the applied changes in the patch, the deprecation warnings still occur, indicating that the patch did not resolve the underlying issue.

**Issue resolved:** `False`

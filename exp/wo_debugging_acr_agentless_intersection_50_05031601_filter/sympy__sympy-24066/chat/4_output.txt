To address the issue with properly detecting that the exponent is dimensionless, we need to modify the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method to correctly handle cases where dimensionless quantities are involved in exponential functions. The key aspect to solve this issue is to ensure that when dealing with exponential functions, the dimension should be properly detected as dimensionless. We need to adjust the handling of `Function` in the method to achieve this.

Here's the patch to fix the issue:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            return (expr.func(*(f[0] for f in fds)),\n                    *(d[1] for d in fds))\n=======\n            factors = [f[0] for f in fds]\n            dimensions = [d[1] for d in fds]\n            if all(self.get_dimension_system().is_dimensionless(d) for d in dimensions):\n                return expr.func(*factors), Dimension(1)\n            return expr.func(*factors), *dimensions\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

In this patch, the logic inside the `Function` handling section was modified to check if all dimensions associated with the function's arguments are dimensionless. If they are dimensionless, the overall dimension of the function is returned as dimensionless (`Dimension(1)`). Otherwise, original logic is maintained.

Since we currently have access to the `ManagementUtility` class declaration, the next step is to locate and review the code for the method that handles the instantiation of `CommandParser`. Given the issue description, we should target a method in `django/core/management/__init__.py` where `CommandParser` is instantiated, likely within a method handling command execution or parsing.

Let's search for and review the source code for the `execute` method within the `ManagementUtility` class, as it's a common method name in command-related classes that may include parsing functionality.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/management/__init__.py", "ManagementUtility.execute")
```

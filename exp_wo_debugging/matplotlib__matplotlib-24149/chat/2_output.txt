To resolve the issue, I will investigate the behavior of the `ax.bar` method in the `_axes.py` file since it is mentioned in the traceback. 

The most relevant part of the traceback points to the following functions:
1. `Axes.bar`
2. `Axes._convert_dx`
3. `matplotlib.cbook._safe_first_finite`

I need to retrieve the source code for these methods and functions to understand their logic and identify the bug. 

```python
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py", "Axes.bar")
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py", "Axes._convert_dx")
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py", "_safe_first_finite")
```

To address the issue, I need to see more of the code that handles how `autodoc_type_aliases` interacts with the `autodoc_typehints` 'description' mode. The method `format_signature` suggests where signatures are formatted but doesn't include alias handling logic. Further examination is needed to understand alias application during description processing.

I need to search more about how type hints are processed in the Sphinx autodoc system, particularly when `autodoc_typehints` is set to 'description', including any component that manipulates type aliases.

Thus, further code retrieval is necessary to locate components responsible for processing and converting type hints with respect to aliases.

```python
search_code_in_codebase("autodoc_type_aliases")
search_code_in_codebase("autodoc_typehints")
search_code_in_file("sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py", "autodoc-process-signature")
search_method_in_codebase("format_annotation")
```

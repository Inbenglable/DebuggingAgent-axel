To determine which of the returned contents are relevant, let's analyze each one:

1. **reproduce.py:AlterField.reduce**  
   This snippet provides an implementation of the `reduce` method with logic related to the `AlterField` operation. It's directly aimed at addressing the issue, as it introduces handling for when `operation` is an instance of `AlterField`.

2. **debugging_test.py:AlterField.reduce**  
   This snippet doesn't actually include a `reduce` method implementation. Instead, it shows an `__init__` method for the `AlterField` class and appears to be unrelated to the `reduce` logic itself. Therefore, it's not relevant to our current needs.

3. **django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py:AlterField.reduce**  
   This snippet includes the implementation of the `reduce` method in the `fields.py` file, which is likely part of the core migrations functionality in Django. Since the issue concerns the `reduce` method not properly handling `AlterField` operations, this is relevant to the bug report.

Based on this analysis, the relevant contents we need are:

```
reproduce.py:AlterField.reduce
django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py:AlterField.reduce
```

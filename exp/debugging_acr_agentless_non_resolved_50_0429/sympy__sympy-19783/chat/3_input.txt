You need to trace the abnormal program to resolve project issues and submit pull requests.
Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **sympy** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Dagger() * IdentityOperator() is not simplified
As discussed on the mailing list the following does not work.
```
from sympy.physics.quantum.dagger import Dagger
from sympy.physics.quantum.operator import Operator
from sympy.physics.quantum import IdentityOperator
A = Operators('A')
Identity = IdentityOperator()
A * Identity #This gives A, correctly
B = Dagger(A)
B * Identity #This returns A^\dagger I 
```

This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
To analyze the abnormal program behavior, we need to understand how the `Dagger()` and `IdentityOperator()` interacts within the Sympy framework.

From the test output, the assertion that `B * Identity == B` fails because `B * Identity` returns `Dagger(A) * I`. The core issue is that while `A * Identity` simplifies to `A`, `Dagger(A) * Identity` does not simplify to `Dagger(A)` as expected. 

The methods involved in this behavior are `Operator.__mul__` and `Expr.__mul__`. `Operator.__mul__` correctly handles the case where `A * Identity` results in `A`. However, `Expr.__mul__` does not simplify the expression when `Dagger(A)` is involved. 

Given this analysis, we need to locate where this simplification should occur. It likely needs to be handled in either the `Dagger` class or in how `Dagger` interacts with other quantum expressions in the `__mul__` methods.

The next logical step is to observe how the `Dagger` class creates and interacts with instances, particularly when `Dagger(A)` is multiplied by `IdentityOperator`. This would point us towards handling the multiplication logic in a more generalized or specific manner for the `Dagger` class, as similar to `Operator`.

Let's trace into the method that creates the Dagger instance:
Observed method: `sympy/physics/quantum/dagger.py:Dagger.__new__`
==================================================
The `Dagger.__new__` method is responsible for creating instances of `Dagger`. It checks if the argument `arg` has an `adjoint` method, and if so, it uses that method to obtain the adjoint (which returns the `Dagger` of `arg`). This is stored in `obj` and returned if it is not `None`.

In the given information and execution trace, we see that `Dagger(A)` is correctly created when running this method. The issue does not lie in this creation itself but rather when applying operations, specifically the multiplication of `Dagger(A)` with `IdentityOperator`.

The simplification rule that replaces `B * Identity` with `B` (when `B` is `Dagger(A)`) seems to be missing or not implemented. Therefore, the problematic behavior does not seem to be in `Dagger.__new__` but rather in how multiplication operations handle products involving `Dagger` and `IdentityOperator`.

To further investigate and locate the buggy method, let's observe how multiplication involving `Dagger` and `IdentityOperator` is handled, and trace the multiplication operator `__mul__` for expressions:

Observed scope: `sympy/physics/quantum/operator.py:__mul__` and relevant parts in `Expr` class for multiplication.
==================================================


Now you choose downstream method IdentityOperator.__mul__ to further observe, tracing the abnormal program behavior.
This is the method code:
   308	    def __mul__(self, other):
   309	
   310	        if isinstance(other, Operator):
   311	            return other
   312	
   313	        return Mul(self, other)


This is the runtime information of IdentityOperator.__mul__:

You need to trace the abnormal program behavior step by step to identify the root cause of the bug and locate the buggy method that contains the code to be fixed.
Now, please first analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior. 

Then, if you can already locate the buggy method and buggy code, reply with:
Buggy method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Otherwise, continue tracing by telling me the code line scope that you want to deeper observe, we will show you the deeper downstream run-time information of the scope you select. Please reply with:
Observed scope: `{FILE_PATH}:{START_LOC}-{END_LOC}`
Note that {FILE_PATH} refers to the path relative to the repository.

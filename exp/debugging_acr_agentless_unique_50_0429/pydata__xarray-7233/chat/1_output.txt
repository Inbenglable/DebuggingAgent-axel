To analyze the abnormal behavior observed in the program execution, we need to trace the flow of the relevant functions and methods. Given the information provided, the transformation from coordinates to variables occurs during the `construct` method of the `DatasetCoarsen` class.

Let's begin by focusing on the method where this transformation occurs during the coarsen operation.

Observed method: `xarray/core/rolling.py:DatasetCoarsen.construct`

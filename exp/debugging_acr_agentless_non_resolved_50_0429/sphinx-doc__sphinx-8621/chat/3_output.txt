To begin addressing the issue with the `:kbd:` role generating incorrect HTML for standalone and compound keystrokes involving the `-`, `+`, or `^` characters, we first need to delve into the implementation of how the `:kbd:` role processes its input and generates HTML. A good starting point is the code that handles the role's logic. Typically in Sphinx, roles are defined as a combination of reStructuredText (reST) directives and nodes.

Given that we are dealing with the generation of HTML from a Sphinx role, it's likely the issue resides in the part of the codebase responsible for handling the `:kbd:` role, parsing it, and transforming it into HTML output. This might be within Sphinx's internal logic for handling roles or extensions.

I will begin my investigation by locating the part of the code handling the `:kbd:` role. Sphinx uses a combination of nodes and writers (like an HTML writer) to transform these nodes into the final output. So, let's start by observing the relevant methods involved in processing the `:kbd:` role to pinpoint where the transformation might be mishandling these characters.

Observed method: `sphinx/roles/__init__.py:kbd_role` (if it exists, or I would continue with another relevant method if necessary)

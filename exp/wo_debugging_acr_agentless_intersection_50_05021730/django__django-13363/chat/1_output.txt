To address the issue, I need to review the source code of the `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` classes or methods. This involves looking at how they handle the `tzinfo` parameter in the specified file. The issue description provides file paths, so I will start by searching for the relevant classes in the files mentioned. 

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncDate")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncTime")
```

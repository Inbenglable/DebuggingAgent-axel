To address this issue, I need to inspect the existing implementation of the `:kbd:` role in the Sphinx project. This involves identifying how Sphinx currently processes and renders `kbd` roles with respect to the separator characters (`-`, `+`, `^`). I need to review the relevant code to understand how the current logic works and where adjustments are needed.

I'll start by searching for the method or class responsible for processing the `:kbd:` role. If I don't have enough details on where to find it, I will search for the related functionality in the codebase.

```python
search_code_in_codebase(":kbd:`")
```

To address the issue, we need to ensure the `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` option sets a default file permission of `0o644` when files are uploaded using `FileSystemStorage`. Based on the previous search results, the `FileSystemStorage` class likely handles file permissions. 

Here are the steps we need to follow before generating a patch:

1. Retrieve the `_save` method from `FileSystemStorage` in `django/core/files/storage.py`, as it likely deals with saving files and could be the place to set default file permissions.
2. Retrieve the `__init__` or any method in `FileSystemStorage` class where `file_permissions_mode` is initialized since we need to ensure if there's any direct assignment or default setting available.

Let's begin by gathering the code for the `_save` method, as it's crucial for handling the file save operation.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/files/storage.py", "FileSystemStorage._save")
search_method_in_file("django/core/files/storage.py", "FileSystemStorage.__init__")
```

To generate the patch, I have already obtained the necessary source code for the `URLValidator`. This code provides sufficient context to address the changes needed in response to the new URL splitting behavior introduced by Python bpo-43882, which strips LF, CR, and tab characters from URLs prior to validation.

Therefore, I'm ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

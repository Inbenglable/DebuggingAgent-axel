To resolve the issue with JSONField not being displayed correctly in the Django admin when read-only, I need to ensure that the JSONField values are formatted using their `prepare_value` method in the `display_for_field` function in the `django/contrib/admin/utils.py` file.

I have already retrieved the `display_for_field` function code. Now, I need to retrieve the `prepare_value` method from the `JSONField` class in `django/db/models/fields/json.py` to understand how it formats the value. This will help me with modifying the `display_for_field` function accordingly.

Let's retrieve the `prepare_value` method from the JSONField class.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/fields/json.py", "prepare_value")
```

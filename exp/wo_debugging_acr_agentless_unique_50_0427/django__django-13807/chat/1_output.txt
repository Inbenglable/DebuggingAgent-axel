To address the issue with SQL reserved keywords like `order` not being quoted properly in SQLite, I need to locate the function `check_constraints` in the specified file `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py` to see how the current code is structured. This will aid in generating the patch to fix the issue. Since the location of the method is known, I'll search for it directly in the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py", "check_constraints")
```

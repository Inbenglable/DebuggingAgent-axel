## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Unexpected exception when multiplying geometry.Point and number
```python
from sympy import geometry as ge
import sympy

point1 = ge.Point(0,0)
point2 = ge.Point(1,1)
```

This line works fine
```python
point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)
```

But when I write the same this way it raises an exception
```python
point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2
```

```

    130         # A point where only `dim` is specified is initialized

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

    221         except TypeError:

GeometryError: Don't know how to add 2.0*Point2D(1, 1) and a Point object
```

The expected behaviour is, that both lines give the same result

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve this issue, I'll first need to examine the source code of the `Point` class, specifically the `__add__` method, as it is involved in the exception handling. Examining this method will help determine why the behavior differs when multiplying with a number prior to the addition of points. First, let's locate this method definition.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("Point.__add__")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("Point.__add__")
RESULT:
#### sympy/geometry/point.py:Point.__add__
```python
    def __add__(self, other):
        """Add other to self by incrementing self's coordinates by
        those of other.

        Notes
        =====

        >>> from sympy.geometry.point import Point

        When sequences of coordinates are passed to Point methods, they
        are converted to a Point internally. This __add__ method does
        not do that so if floating point values are used, a floating
        point result (in terms of SymPy Floats) will be returned.

        >>> Point(1, 2) + (.1, .2)
        Point2D(1.1, 2.2)

        If this is not desired, the `translate` method can be used or
        another Point can be added:

        >>> Point(1, 2).translate(.1, .2)
        Point2D(11/10, 11/5)
        >>> Point(1, 2) + Point(.1, .2)
        Point2D(11/10, 11/5)

        See Also
        ========

        sympy.geometry.point.Point.translate

        """
        try:
            s, o = Point._normalize_dimension(self, Point(other, evaluate=False))
        except TypeError:
            raise GeometryError("Don't know how to add {} and a Point object".format(other))

        coords = [simplify(a + b) for a, b in zip(s, o)]
        return Point(coords, evaluate=False)

```


==================================================

Your Output:
In order to resolve the issue, we need to examine how the multiplication of a `geometry.Point` by a number is handled. Let's search for the `__mul__` method within the `Point` class to understand its behavior. This will help us in ensuring that both operations (`point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` and `sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2`) behave consistently.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/geometry/point.py", "Point.__mul__")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_file("sympy/geometry/point.py", "Point.__mul__")
RESULT:
#### sympy/geometry/point.py:Point.__mul__
```python
    def __mul__(self, factor):
        """Multiply point's coordinates by a factor.

        Notes
        =====

        >>> from sympy.geometry.point import Point

        When multiplying a Point by a floating point number,
        the coordinates of the Point will be changed to Floats:

        >>> Point(1, 2)*0.1
        Point2D(0.1, 0.2)

        If this is not desired, the `scale` method can be used or
        else only multiply or divide by integers:

        >>> Point(1, 2).scale(1.1, 1.1)
        Point2D(11/10, 11/5)
        >>> Point(1, 2)*11/10
        Point2D(11/10, 11/5)

        See Also
        ========

        sympy.geometry.point.Point.scale
        """
        factor = sympify(factor)
        coords = [simplify(x*factor) for x in self.args]
        return Point(coords, evaluate=False)

```


==================================================

Your Output:
To resolve the issue, the main concern is with the `__add__` method of the `Point` class, which raises an exception when handling multiplication with a `Point` and a scalar in different order. The `__mul__` method only handles multiplication, but does not affect how addition is handled in `__add__`.

To ensure consistent behavior regardless of order, we may need to modify the `__add__` method to handle cases where the `other` operand is a `Mul` object containing a scalar and a `Point`.

I have already retrieved the necessary source code for the methods in question: `Point.__add__` and `Point.__mul__`. This information is sufficient to generate a patch to fix the described issue. 

Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

The current observed abnormal program behavior indicates an ImportError when trying to import `Expression` from the `_pytest.python` module. This suggests the initial assumption about where `Expression` is located might be incorrect, or the `Expression` class may not exist within `_pytest.python`.

Given the issue raised in the Python interpreter about `Expression.compile("False")`, and considering the assertion error related to the Python debug build, the Expression class needs to interact with Python compilation in some way. This suggests that it might not be a direct part of the public API or it may reside in a more internal or utility-based module within pytest.

It is necessary to further trace where the `Expression` functionality is intended to be incorporated in pytest and if it is part of a more hidden or less obvious module.

Next step: Investigate relevant modules and locate any plausible methods related to expression handling or compilation within pytest that relate to the error condition described.

Observed method: `_pytest/config/__init__.py` is often used for configuration and initialization, which might include expression compilation or handling.

Let's proceed to inspect this module for any potential involvement in expression evaluation or compilation.

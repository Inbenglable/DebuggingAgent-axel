<ISSUE>
autodoc: empty __all__ attribute is ignored
**Describe the bug**
autodoc: empty `__all__` attribute is ignored

**To Reproduce**
```
# example.py
__all__ = []


def foo():
    "docstring"


def bar():
    "docstring"


def baz():
    "docstring"
```
```
# index.rst
.. automodule:: example
   :members:
```

All foo, bar, and baz are shown.

**Expected behavior**
No entries should be shown because `__all__` is empty.

**Your project**
No

**Screenshots**
No

**Environment info**
- OS: Mac
- Python version: 3.9.1
- Sphinx version: HEAD of 3.x
- Sphinx extensions: sphinx.ext.autodoc
- Extra tools: No

**Additional context**
No

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To address this issue, I'll need to examine the Sphinx autodoc implementation, specifically how it deals with the `__all__` attribute when generating documentation for modules. Typically, this involves checking how it retrieves members in the presence of the `__all__` attribute and determining if it distinguishes between an empty `__all__` and no `__all__`.

I will start by looking for relevant methods in the Sphinx codebase that handle the processing of modules and the handling of the `__all__` attribute.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("process_docstring")
search_method_in_codebase("get_module_members")
search_method_in_codebase("filter_members")
search_class_in_codebase("ModuleScanner")
search_method_in_codebase("analyzer_for")
```

==================================================

Your Output:
To resolve the issue, I need to examine more closely how the `filter_members` method processes module members with respect to the `__all__` attribute. I suspect that the handling of empty `__all__` lists might be addressed within this method or nearby, particularly in relation to the `options.members` setting. 

To proceed, I will retrieve the source code of the `Documenter.filter_members` method.

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

Based on the analysis of the patch, the test output before and after applying the patch, and the details provided in the issue description, here's the assessment:

1. **Patch Review**:
   - The patch modifies the condition within the `Plotter._finalize_figure` method to handle `Nominal` scales similar to categorical scales. The change updates the condition to account for both categorical strings and the `Nominal` scale type, theoretically adjusting tick settings accordingly.

2. **Test Output Before Patch**:
   - The test failed with an `AssertionError` stating that the "Nominal scale is not drawn to +/- 0.5 from the first and last tick," which is consistent with the behavior described in the issue.

3. **Test Output After Patch**:
   - There is no change in the test output; it still fails with the same `AssertionError`. This indicates that the patch did not successfully address the issue of adjusting the nominal scale to behave like a categorical scale.

Given that the same error persists after the attempted fix, this suggests that the logic introduced in the patch did not resolve the inconsistency with the nominal scale behavior as described in the issue.

**Conclusion**:
- The issue is not resolved by the patch because the tests still produce the same error, indicating no change or improvement in the nominal scale behavior.

Issue resolved: `False`

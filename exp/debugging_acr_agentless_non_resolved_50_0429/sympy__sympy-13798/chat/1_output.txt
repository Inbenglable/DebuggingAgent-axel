Based on the stack trace, the error occurs when trying to use a custom `mul_symbol` (a thin space `\,`) with the `latex` function from SymPy. The `latex` function calls the `LatexPrinter` class constructor, where the error is thrown at line 160 in `sympy/printing/latex.py`. The root of the issue seems to be a dictionary lookup failure, as indicated by the `KeyError: '\\,'`. The dictionary, `mul_symbol_table`, contains predefined multiplication symbols, and it does not include the thin space used in the test case, which leads to the `KeyError`.

From the trace, the problematic area is:
```python
mul_symbol_table[self._settings['mul_symbol']]
```

Given this analysis, we can observe that the possibility to use arbitrary multiplication symbols is not supported because `mul_symbol` is constrained by a predefined set of keys in `mul_symbol_table`.

Hence, the next step is to take a closer look at the initialization and dictionary handling inside the `LatexPrinter.__init__` method.

Observed method: `sympy/printing/latex.py:LatexPrinter.__init__`

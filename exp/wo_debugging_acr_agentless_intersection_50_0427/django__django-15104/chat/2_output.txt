To proceed, I need to retrieve the source code for the `only_relation_agnostic_fields` method in the `MigrationAutodetector` class, as the KeyError is occurring there. This will help me understand how the 'to' key is being handled and map out a suitable fix.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/autodetector.py", "MigrationAutodetector.only_relation_agnostic_fields")
```

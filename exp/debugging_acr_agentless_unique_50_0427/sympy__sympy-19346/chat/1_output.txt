Analyzing the provided output, the issue stems from the `srepr` function not providing the expected representation for sets and dictionaries within the SymPy library. The test ran checks for sets, expecting the output to be `FiniteSet(Symbol('x'), Symbol('y'))`, but instead returned `{y, x}`. The expected representation for dictionaries is also not being returned as expected.

The debugging trace shows that the execution entered the `srepr` function in `sympy/printing/repr.py`. However, it directly returned the string `'{y, x}'` rather than formatting it as `FiniteSet`.

Given the current trace, the next logical step is to understand how `srepr` operates internally, specifically how it determines the string representation of sets and dictionaries. The `srepr` function calls `ReprPrinter.doprint(expr)` on line 345.

The next step in tracing the code is to delve into the `ReprPrinter` class to see how `doprint` works for sets and dictionaries, and why it's not formatting them correctly as per the symbols.

Observed method: `sympy/printing/repr.py:ReprPrinter.doprint`

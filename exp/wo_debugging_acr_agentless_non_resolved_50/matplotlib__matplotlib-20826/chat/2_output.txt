To address the issue with `ax.clear()` in Matplotlib concerning shared axes, it's essential to focus on the `clear()` functions that are most likely to be involved with Axis and Axes components. These components are directly related to rendering and managing ticks and tick labels which are the core areas affected by the `clear()` method.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant `clear()` method implementations related to the issue and why they might be needed:

1. **lib/matplotlib/axis.py:Axis.clear**
   - This is directly related to clearing an Axis object, including resetting ticks and their properties. This is highly relevant since the issue involves ticks and tick labels.

2. **lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py:_AxesBase.clear**
   - The `clear` method within `AxesBase` likely connects to the overall clearing of an Axes object, which is an overarching container that includes settings for ticks, labels, etc.

Other `clear()` implementations found in the search results do not seem directly relevant to the issue of clearing shared axes impacts because they deal with specific components (e.g., spines, transforms, cursors, figures) or are irrelevant tools/widgets not directly impacting tick label visibility.

Based on this analysis, the following portions are the most relevant to the problem:

```
lib/matplotlib/axis.py:Axis.clear
lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py:_AxesBase.clear
```

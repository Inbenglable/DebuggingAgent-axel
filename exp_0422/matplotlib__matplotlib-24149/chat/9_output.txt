To address the issue where `ax.bar([np.nan], [np.nan])` raises a `StopIteration` when there are no finite values in the dataset, we'll modify the `_safe_first_finite` function in the `cbook` module. We'll ensure it handles the situation by returning `None` if no finite elements are found, preventing the `StopIteration` exception from being raised. Here's the patch:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        return next(val for val in obj if safe_isfinite(val))\n=======\n        return next((val for val in obj if safe_isfinite(val)), None)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This change introduces a default return value of `None` for the `next()` function, which is triggered only if there are no suitable values, thereby preventing the `StopIteration` exception and maintaining harmony with existing code behavior.

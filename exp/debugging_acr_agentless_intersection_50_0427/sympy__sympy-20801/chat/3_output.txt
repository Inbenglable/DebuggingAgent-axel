In order to generate a patch, I need to retrieve the source code for the `Float.__eq__` method where the issue resides. 

I know the file path is `sympy/core/numbers.py`, so I will use the search API to retrieve the specific method's source code.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/core/numbers.py", "Float.__eq__")
```

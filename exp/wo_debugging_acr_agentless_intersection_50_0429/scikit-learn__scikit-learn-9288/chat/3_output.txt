To address the issue with the `KMeans` algorithm, I need to explore the `k_means` function since it is called within the `fit` method of `KMeans` and is likely responsible for the parallelization behavior.

Therefore, I will retrieve the source code for the `k_means` function to understand its implementation and identify potential sources of the discrepancy.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("k_means")
```

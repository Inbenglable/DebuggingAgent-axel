The provided patch attempts to address the issue by introducing a `FutureWarning`. This warning informs the user that the behavior of automatically transforming a structured array into an `NdarrayMixin` will change in a future release. The intention is good, but there's a mistake in the patch that prevents the program from compiling.

### Analysis of the Patch and Test Outputs:

1. **Patch Review:**
   - The patch adds a `FutureWarning` message before any transformation occurs.
   - The patch intends to instruct users that they should wrap their data in a `Column`, and it suggests changes for a future version of Astropy.
   - However, there is a critical error in the implementation: the warning message string is not terminated correctly, leading to a `SyntaxError`.

2. **Test Output Before the Patch:**
   - The test raises an `AssertionError`, indicating that the structured array was transformed into `NdarrayMixin`, which is the issue described in the original report.

3. **Test Output After the Patch:**
   - The test fails to run due to a `SyntaxError` caused by an unclosed string literal in the `FutureWarning` message.
   - This prevents the test from even reaching the part where the bug would be checked for resolution.

### Conclusion:
Due to the syntax error in the patch code, the program does not execute correctly. As a result, we cannot conclude whether the underlying issue of transformation into `NdarrayMixin` has been addressed or not because the test does not run successfully.

Issue resolved: `False`

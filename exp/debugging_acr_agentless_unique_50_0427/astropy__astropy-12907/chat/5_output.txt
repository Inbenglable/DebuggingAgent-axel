Upon analyzing the runtime information from the `_separable` function, we observe the following abnormal behavior:

1. **Combination Logic Flaw**:
   - When combining the separability matrices of nested models (`Pix2Sky_TAN() & Linear1D(10) & Linear1D(5)`), the matrices are combined using `_operators[transform.op]`.
   - The `_cstack` operator fails to maintain independence across nested sub-models, improperly asserting full separability for nested models.

2. **Mathematical Misrepresentation**:
   - The logic in `_cstack` appears to incorrectly combine the matrices, especially in line 247 where `_np.hstack` combines `cleft` and `cright`. This leads to incorrect values, indicating dependence, where independence was expected.
   - The expected mathematical independence is not preserved due to how `_operators` applies `_cstack`.

3. **Mistakenly Shared State**:
   - The calculations inside `_cstack` suggest it neither correctly preserves nor represents separability between nested compound model outputs and inputs, ultimately failing the expected test.

Thus, from this analysis, we can localize the buggy logic that results in incorrect output from `_separable`, especially during matrix combination with `_operators`.

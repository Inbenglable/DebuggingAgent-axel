To resolve the issue of adding DISTINCT support for the Avg and Sum aggregates, we need to modify the `Avg` and `Sum` classes to allow the DISTINCT parameter. Based on the current code, we will change the `allow_distinct` property for both these classes to `True`. Here are the edits:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):\n=======\nclass Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):\n=======\nclass Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch update sets the `allow_distinct` attribute to `True` for both the `Avg` and `Sum` aggregate classes, enabling the use of the DISTINCT parameter.

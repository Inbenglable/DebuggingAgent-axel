To resolve the issue described, I need to review the relevant source code related to the generation of SQL statements for index creation in Django. The primary area to investigate would be the code responsible for handling the ordering logic and opclasses in index creation.

The description points to a specific location in the codebase: `django/db/backends/ddl_references.py`. The likely relevant component is the `Columns` class, which seems to be involved in formatting SQL statements for index creation. I will first search for the `Columns` class in `ddl_references.py`.

Additionally, if the `Columns` class has methods related to suffixes or SQL generation, those should be examined to identify where the bug is occurring.

Here's the plan:
1. Identify the `Columns` class in `ddl_references.py`.
2. Explore key methods within this class that might pertain to suffix handling and SQL formatting.

Let's proceed with searching the relevant class and methods to gain further insights.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/backends/ddl_references.py", "Columns")
```

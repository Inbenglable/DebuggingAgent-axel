To resolve the issue with the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass and properties, I need to review its implementation. Currently, the API results have only shown the class declaration and a part of the docstring, not the full implementation of the `__init__` method or any other methods within the class.

To proceed, I need to retrieve the full implementation of the `InheritDocstrings` class in the `astropy/utils/misc.py` file. This will provide all details necessary to understand its current functionality and proceed with modifying it to include properties.

```python
search_class_in_file("astropy/utils/misc.py", "InheritDocstrings")
```

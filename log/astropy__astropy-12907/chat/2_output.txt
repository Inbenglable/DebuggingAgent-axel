To isolate the problem with the nested compound models and help in debugging, we will create a minimal debugging test case focusing on reproducing the error in a simplified manner. This will help in identifying where the separability logic is not being applied correctly in nested compound models.

```python
from astropy.modeling import models as m
from astropy.modeling.separable import separability_matrix

# Minimal debugging test to reproduce the issue
# Define a simple compound model
cm = m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)

# Define the more complex model without nesting
complex_model = m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)

# Define the nested compound model
nested_model = m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm

print("Debugging Test 1: Simple compound model's separability matrix")
print(separability_matrix(cm))  # Expected: [[True, False], [False, True]]

print("Debugging Test 2: Complex model without nesting's separability matrix")
print(separability_matrix(complex_model))  # Expected: Separability matrix with independent components

print("Debugging Test 3: Nested compound model's separability matrix")
print(separability_matrix(nested_model))  # Expected: Same as complex model, but with nested logic
```

This minimal set of tests will target identifying where separability is incorrectly calculated, by using both non-nested and nested models to directly compare the results.

To review the patch and determine whether the issue is fixed, let's analyze the provided context, patch, and test outputs.

### Analysis of the Issue and Proposed Patch:
- **Issue Description**: The issue occurs because the `trim_docstring` function incorrectly calculates indentation when the first line of the docstring is not empty. This leads to an error with the `docutils` library.
- **Proposed Patch**: The patch introduces a change to skip the first line in the indentation calculation for the `trim_docstring` function. This adjustment aims to prevent the error by excluding the first line, which often has zero indentation, from impacting the calculation.

### Review of Test Outputs:
- **Original Output**: The test attempted to import `simplify_exception` from `django.contrib.admindocs.views`, resulting in an `ImportError`. This makes it impossible to determine whether the patch addressed the reported issue because the test setup itself fails before reaching the relevant code.
- **Patched Output**: The output remains unchanged after applying the patch, with the same `ImportError`. This indicates that the test never actually executes the docstring processing logic to validate the effectiveness of the patch.

### Conclusion:
The test is not correctly set up to run due to a missing or incorrect import, and as such, it does not reach the point where the patched logic would be tested. Therefore, it is impossible to verify from the provided information whether the issue is resolved.

**Issue resolved: `False`**

The primary step before determining if the patch resolves the issue would be to fix the test setup by addressing the `ImportError`. Once the test can run and evaluate the docstring processing, a proper assessment of whether the patch resolves the issue can be made.

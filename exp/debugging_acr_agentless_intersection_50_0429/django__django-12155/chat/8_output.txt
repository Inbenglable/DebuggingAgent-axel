To resolve the issue with the `trim_docstring` function not handling docstrings that start on the first line, we'll skip the first line when calculating the minimum indentation. Below is the patch that makes this adjustment:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())\n=======\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch modifies the line where the indentation is calculated, ensuring that the first line is skipped, which resolves the problem described in the issue. The rest of the function logic remains unchanged to maintain its original functionality.

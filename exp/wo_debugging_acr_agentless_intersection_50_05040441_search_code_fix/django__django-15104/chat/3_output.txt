To resolve the encountered `KeyError` issue in the Django project's `MigrationAutodetector.only_relation_agnostic_fields` method, we can replace the `del` statement with the `pop` method, ensuring that it won't raise a `KeyError` when the `'to'` key is missing. This change should maintain the existing functionality while preventing the error. Here are the patch details:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/migrations/autodetector.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                del deconstruction[2]['to']\n=======\n                deconstruction[2].pop('to', None)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

To determine whether the issue is fixed, let's examine the test output before and after applying the patch, as well as the patch itself.

### Original Output (Before Patch)
```
[0.01624231 0.18925809 0.36227387 0.53528964 0.70830542 0.8813212 ]
AssertionError: Expected bins to start at 0 and end at 1, but got [0.01624231 0.18925809 0.36227387 0.53528964 0.70830542 0.8813212 ]
```
The bins of the histogram did not start at 0 or end at 1, which did not meet the expected behavior specified in the bug issue.

### Patched Output (After Patch)
```
[0.         0.14285714 0.28571429 0.42857143 0.57142857 0.71428571 0.85714286 1.        ]
```
After applying the patch, the bins array starts at 0 and ends at 1, which aligns with the expected outcome as described in the bug report.

### Patch Analysis
The patch modifies the `hist_kwargs` dictionary in the `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py` file, by ensuring that the `range` parameter is included when `density=True`. This change ensures that the specified range is respected during the calculation of the histogram when density normalization is applied.

### Conclusion
Given that the patched output now satisfies the expected condition of starting at 0 and ending at 1 for the bins, and the patch correctly updates the code to ensure the `range` is respected, it indicates that the issue is resolved.

Issue resolved: `True`

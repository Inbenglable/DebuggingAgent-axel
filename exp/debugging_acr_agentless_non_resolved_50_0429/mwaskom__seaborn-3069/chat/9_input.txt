You are a PR reviewer that needs to review the patch generated by a bug repair agent and determine whether the issue is fixed or not.
This is the bug issue, which is in the **seaborn** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Nominal scale should be drawn the same way as categorical scales
Three distinctive things happen on the categorical axis in seaborn's categorical plots:

1. The scale is drawn to +/- 0.5 from the first and last tick, rather than using the normal margin logic
2. A grid is not shown, even when it otherwise would be with the active style
3. If on the y axis, the axis is inverted

It probably makes sense to have `so.Nominal` scales (including inferred ones) do this too. Some comments on implementation:

1. This is actually trickier than you'd think; I may have posted an issue over in matplotlib about this at one point, or just discussed on their gitter. I believe the suggested approach is to add an invisible artist with sticky edges and set the margin to 0. Feels like a hack! I might have looked into setting the sticky edges _on the spine artist_ at one point?

2. Probably straightforward to do in `Plotter._finalize_figure`. Always a good idea? How do we defer to the theme if the user wants to force a grid? Should the grid be something that is set in the scale object itself

3. Probably straightforward to implement but I am not exactly sure where would be best.

And this is the original output when running the test (before applying the patch):
## ORIGINAL OUTPUT

The repair agent has tried to generate a patch to fix the issue:

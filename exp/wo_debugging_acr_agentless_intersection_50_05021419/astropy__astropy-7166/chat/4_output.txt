Based on the source code of the `__init__` method in the `InheritDocstrings` class, I can identify that the issue arises from the usage of `inspect.isfunction(val)` which excludes properties. In order to resolve this, I can incorporate `inspect.isfunction(val)` and `isinstance(val, property)` to also check if the member is a property, and similarly handle its docstring.

I'm ready to generate the patch to fix the issue.

Ready generation: `True`

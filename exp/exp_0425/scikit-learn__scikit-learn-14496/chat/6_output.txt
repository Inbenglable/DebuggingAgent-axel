The patch modifies the code in `sklearn/cluster/optics_.py` to ensure that `min_samples` is converted to an integer after multiplying with `n_samples`. This aligns with the proposed fix in the issue, which suggests rounding and converting the result to an integer for compatibility and correctness.

### Patch Analysis:

- **Original Code:**
  ```python
  if min_samples <= 1:
      min_samples = max(2, min_samples * n_samples)  # Still a float
  ```
  
- **Patched Code:**
  ```python
  if min_samples <= 1:
      min_samples = int(round(max(2, min_samples * n_samples)))  # Converted to int
  ```
  
- The patched version uses `int(round(...))`, which ensures that `min_samples` becomes an integer value, fixing the TypeError that arises when a float is used as an input for `n_neighbors` in the `NearestNeighbours` class instantiation.

### Test Output Analysis:

1. **Original Output:** Shows a `TypeError` because the original code passes a float value to `n_neighbors`, which requires an integer.
   
2. **Patched Output:** There is no error output, indicating that the code runs successfully after the patch.

The absence of any error in the patched output suggests that the patch has resolved the issue by converting `min_samples` to an integer before it is used in the process that led to the previous error.

Given this analysis, I can conclude that the issue is resolved.

Issue resolved: `True`

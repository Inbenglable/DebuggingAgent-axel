To fix the issue, I need to retrieve the source code of the `model_to_dict` method in `django/forms/models.py` to understand the current implementation of the method and to make the necessary changes.

I'll proceed with retrieving the source code for this method.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/forms/models.py", "model_to_dict")
```

The information retrieved so far from the `inheritance_diagram` class is not sufficient as it doesn't provide any methods or details on how links are generated in SVG diagrams. I need to identify the methods that handle the generation of SVG diagrams and path handling. 

I'll search for methods related to SVG generation in the Sphinx codebase, especially focusing on those involved in link and path construction.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("render_dot_html")
```

To resolve the issue of `xr.combine_by_coords` raising a `ValueError` for identical non-monotonic coordinates, we will modify the part of the code which checks if the indexes for each dimension are monotonically increasing or decreasing, specifically allowing non-varying coordinates that are identical to bypass this check.

Here are the patches to achieve this:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### xarray/core/combine.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                indexes = concatenated.indexes.get(dim)\n=======\n                indexes = concatenated.indexes.get(dim)\n                # Allow identical non-monotonic coordinates\n                if datasets[0].indexes.get(dim).equals(indexes):\n                    continue\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch first retrieves the indexes for each dimension and checks if they are identical to the corresponding indexes in the first dataset. If they are identical, the monotonicity check is bypassed, allowing non-monotonic but identical coordinates to pass without raising a `ValueError`.

Analyzing the current observed code and abnormal program behavior, the `caplog` fixture implementation in `src/_pytest/logging.py` has a method `caplog` which yields a `LogCaptureFixture` instance and calls its `_finalize()` method at the end. This `_finalize()` method is likely related to restoring the log levels. 

To identify the root cause, we need to inspect the `LogCaptureFixture` class and particularly its `_finalize` method to ensure it handles log level restoration correctly.

```python
def caplog(request: FixtureRequest) -> Generator[LogCaptureFixture, None, None]:
    result = LogCaptureFixture(request.node)
    yield result
    result._finalize()
```

Therefore, the next step is to examine the `LogCaptureFixture` implementation and the `_finalize` method therein to check how it is supposed to restore the log levels.

Let's delve into the relevant code in `src/_pytest/logging.py` for `LogCaptureFixture` and `_finalize`.

Observed scope: `src/_pytest/logging.py:353-385`

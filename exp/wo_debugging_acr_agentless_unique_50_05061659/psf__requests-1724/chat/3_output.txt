To resolve the issue, we need to locate the part of the code that handles the `method` argument in the `request` method within the `requests/sessions.py` file. The goal is to ensure the `method` is properly converted to a normal string instead of a Unicode string in Python 2.x, which would prevent the `UnicodeDecodeError`. The code snippet `req.method = method.upper()` indicated in the issue suggests converting the `method` name to uppercase, but it doesn't ensure conversion from Unicode to a standard string.

Since the file path for `sessions.py` is known, we will directly search for the `request` method in this file.

```python
search_method_in_file("requests/sessions.py", "request")
```

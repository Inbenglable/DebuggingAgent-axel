To resolve the issue with the `kahane_simplify()` function in the SymPy project, I will need to retrieve the source code for this method to identify and fix the bug. Since the file path is not provided, I will search for the method in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("kahane_simplify")
```

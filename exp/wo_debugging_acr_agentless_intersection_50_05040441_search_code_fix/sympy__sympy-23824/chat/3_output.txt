To fix the issue in the `kahane_simplify` function where leading uncontracted gamma matrices are reversed, we need to adjust the part of the code that deals with re-inserting these gamma matrices after processing the contractions.

In the code you provided, this operation is performed using a loop that inserts indices into the `resulting_indices` list. The bug occurs because the loop inserts the indices in reverse order.

Below is the required modification to the code in `gamma_matrices.py`:

```pythony
### sympy/physics/hep/gamma_matrices.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    for i in range(0, first_dum_pos):
        [ri.insert(0, free_pos[i]) for ri in resulting_indices]
=======
    for i in range(first_dum_pos - 1, -1, -1):
        [ri.insert(0, free_pos[i]) for ri in resulting_indices]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
This change updates the loop so that it doesn't insert gamma matrices in reverse order. Instead, it preserves the original order of leading uncontracted gamma matrices before contraction.

Here's the JSON representation of the patch:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/physics/hep/gamma_matrices.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    for i in range(0, first_dum_pos):\n        [ri.insert(0, free_pos[i]) for ri in resulting_indices]\n=======\n    for i in range(first_dum_pos - 1, -1, -1):\n        [ri.insert(0, free_pos[i]) for ri in resulting_indices]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch ensures that the insertion order of the gamma matrices is preserved, thereby resolving the issue described.

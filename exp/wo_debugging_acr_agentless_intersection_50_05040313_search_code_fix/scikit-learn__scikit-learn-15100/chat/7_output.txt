To address the issue with the `strip_accents_unicode` method in the `scikit-learn` project, we will modify the code to ensure that the method correctly removes combining characters from strings in NFKD form. The original implementation checks if the string changes after normalization and then applies the stripping only if there was a change. However, in the case of strings already in NFKD form, the check prevents further processing. We need to remove this condition to always strip combining characters.

Here's the necessary modification:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    if normalized == s:\n        return s\n    else:\n        return ''.join([c for c in normalized if not unicodedata.combining(c)])\n=======\n    return ''.join([c for c in normalized if not unicodedata.combining(c)])\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

In this change, we ensure that the function always attempts to remove combining characters from the normalized version of the string, effectively handling cases where the input is already in NFKD form.

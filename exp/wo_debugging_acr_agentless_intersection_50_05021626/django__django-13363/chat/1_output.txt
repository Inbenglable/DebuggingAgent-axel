To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code of the `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` classes, and specifically look at how they handle the `tzinfo` parameter. The primary concern is the handling of timezone information, which is mentioned in the issue with the lines pointing to problematic usage. Therefore, I'll be examining these lines and classes in the `django/db/models/functions/datetime.py` file.

I will start by retrieving the code of `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` from the specified file to understand how the timezone information is being used. 

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncDate")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncTime")
search_code_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "get_current_timezone_name()")
search_code_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TimeZone")
```

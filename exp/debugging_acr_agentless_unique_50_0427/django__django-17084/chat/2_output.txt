The error message provided in the output indicates that there was an attempt to import `Window` from `django.db.models.functions`, which is incorrect. The `Window` class is located in `django.db.models.expressions`, not `django.db.models.functions`.

The erroneous import line in the test script is:

```python
from django.db.models.functions import Coalesce, Window
```

This should be:

```python
from django.db.models import Window
```

This incorrect import path caused the `ImportError`, preventing the script from proceeding further.

Buggy method: `reproduce.py:<module>`

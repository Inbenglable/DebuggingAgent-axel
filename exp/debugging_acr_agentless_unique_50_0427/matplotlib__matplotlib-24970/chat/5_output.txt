To generate a patch, I need to investigate the source code for the method `matplotlib.colors._BaseColorMap.__call__` in the `colors.py` file to precisely understand how it handles the array operations currently causing the deprecation warnings. I will retrieve the source code of this method to analyze how values are clipped and set in the method and identify the problematic parts that need adjustment.

```python
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/colors.py", "_BaseColorMap.__call__")
```

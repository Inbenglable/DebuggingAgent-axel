To resolve the issue with `django.utils.numberformat.format`, I need to examine the source code of the `format` method to understand its current implementation and identify the hardcoded cut-off point that leads to the rendering of small decimals in exponential notation. Since I need to analyze the method source code and I do not know the file path, I will search for the method in the project codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("format")
```

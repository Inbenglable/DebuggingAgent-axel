Based on the issue description, I need to analyze the method `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension()` to understand why it isn't detecting dimensionless exponents correctly.

Let's examine the API returned content:

1. **sympy/physics/units/quantities.py:Quantity._collect_factor_and_dimension:**
   - This function calls `unit_system._collect_factor_and_dimension(expr)` and warns about being deprecated.
   - It seems to be an older version and points towards using the UnitSystem's method.

2. **sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py:UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension:**
   - This function is more comprehensive and likely the one in active use.
   - It includes logic for handling different expressions such as Quantity, Mul, Pow, Add, Derivative, Function, Dimension, or other expressions.
   - Includes handling of Pow expressions, which seems relevant to the issue related to exponent dimension detection.

Between the two contents, the latter one is more relevant because it comprehensively handles different types of expressions, including exponentiation (`Pow`) related to the bug.

Thus, the needed content for further investigation and resolving the bug is:

```
sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py:UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension
```

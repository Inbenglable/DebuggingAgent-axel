I have gathered the source code for the `__eq__` implementation in the relevant files:

- `Basic.__eq__` in `sympy/core/basic.py`
- `Expr.__eq__` in `sympy/core/expr.py`
- `NumberSymbol.__eq__` in `sympy/core/numbers.py`

Now, I need to take a closer look at the Boolean class, especially around how it deals with equality comparisons. If Boolean doesn't correctly handle equality with floating-point numbers, adding that handling is necessary to resolve the issue.

Let's retrieve the code for the Boolean class.

```python
search_class_in_file("sympy/core", "Boolean")
```

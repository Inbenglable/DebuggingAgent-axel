The issue seen with the provided script is related to the usage of the `captured_output` function from Django's testing utilities. The error message: `TypeError: captured_output() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given` indicates that more arguments are being passed to `captured_output` than it expects.

Hereâ€™s the problem breakdown:

- The `captured_output` function is intended to capture output within a context manager, but the way it's currently being called with two positional arguments `'stdout'` and `'stderr'` does not match its expected parameters.

Based on this, the bug certainly lies with the incorrect usage of the `captured_output` context manager. It should be called without specifying output types like `'stdout'` and `'stderr'` directly as arguments. Normally, it captures both `stdout` and `stderr` just by being used within a context.

This points to the faulty section directly, without needing to trace into further methods or files, as the problem is isolated in the script's incorrect use of the Django testing utility.

Buggy method: `reproduce.py:Command.handle`

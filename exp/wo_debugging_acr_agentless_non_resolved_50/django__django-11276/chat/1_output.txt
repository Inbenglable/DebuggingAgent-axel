To address the issue, I need to replace the Django's `escape` function with Python's `html.escape`. First, I need to locate and review the existing `escape` method in the `django.utils.html` module.

Therefore, I'll search for the `escape` method within the appropriate file.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("escape")
```

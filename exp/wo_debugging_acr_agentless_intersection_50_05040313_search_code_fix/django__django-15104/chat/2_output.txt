To resolve this issue, we need to modify the line in the `MigrationAutodetector` class that causes the `KeyError`. Specifically, we need to change the line `del deconstruction[2]['to']` to `deconstruction[2].pop('to', None)` within the `only_relation_agnostic_fields` method.

I need to retrieve the source code for the `only_relation_agnostic_fields` method within the `MigrationAutodetector` class to generate the patch. 

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/autodetector.py", "MigrationAutodetector.only_relation_agnostic_fields")
```

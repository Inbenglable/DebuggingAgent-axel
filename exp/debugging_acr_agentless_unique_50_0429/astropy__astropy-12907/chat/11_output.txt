To address the issue with the `_cstack` method in `astropy/modeling/separable.py`, we'll modify the code to correctly handle nested compound models by ensuring that the separability matrix reflects the intended separable structure.

Here's the patch to resolve the issue:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### astropy/modeling/separable.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        cright = np.zeros((noutp, right.shape[1]))\n        cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = 1\n=======\n        cright = np.zeros((noutp, right.shape[1]))\n        # Adjust to fill only the relevant portion for stacking\n        cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = right\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation:
- The original code erroneously filled the `cright` matrix with ones, which led to the produced separability matrix not accurately reflecting the separability of the nested models.
- We corrected this by ensuring that the `cright` matrix is populated with the relevant values from the `right` input, preserving the structure of the separable models and ensuring correct stacking behaviors.

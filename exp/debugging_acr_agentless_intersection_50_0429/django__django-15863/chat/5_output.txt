To resolve the issue accurately and generate the patch, I need to obtain the source code of the `floatformat` method located in `django/template/defaultfilters.py`, as identified in the debugging history. This will allow me to examine the logic for handling Decimal conversions and propose a fix.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/template/defaultfilters.py", "floatformat")
```

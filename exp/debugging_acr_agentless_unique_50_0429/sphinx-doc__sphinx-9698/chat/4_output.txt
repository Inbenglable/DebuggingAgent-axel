The error message you're encountering is related to a test script that tries to execute a Sphinx project build but fails due to a coding error in the script itself rather than in the Sphinx codebase. The error is a `NameError`, indicating that the `sys` module was not imported correctly in the part of the code that runs the whole test framework in the context where this problem is observed. However, since the `sys` module was actually imported at the top of the provided test script, the error message seems to be referencing an issue that might arise outside of the main script's purview, possibly within some testing harness.

Here is an analysis of the provided test script and error:

1. **Test Script Analysis**:
   - The test script creates a minimal Sphinx project and aims to reproduce the bug mentioned in the issue description.
   - It uses `sphinx.ext.autodoc` to document and register a method and a property.
   - The `check_index_entries` function inspects index entries to assert that the method registered as a property does not include parentheses.

2. **Error Diagnosis**:
   - The `NameError: name 'sys' is not defined` arises from a different file (`run_debugging_test.py`) that isn't visible here but supports testing script execution.
   - The test script itself is set up correctly with `sys` defined, suggesting the fault lies outside this script.

3. To focus on the issue originally reported in the Sphinx documentation issue (index entries with parentheses for `py:method` directives marked as properties), we need to analyze the behavior when `:property:` makes an index entry with wrongly included parentheses.

Since the `NameError` is due to the testing environment outside the core Sphinx or this test script, let's return to debugging the actual bug related to the Sphinx project. We need to analyze where within Sphinx's builders or indices this parens-adding behavior occurs.

Thus, the next step is to trace the abnormal behavior related to indexing and investigate which internal objects' types or properties drive their display name formatting incorrectly.

Observed method: `sphinx.domains.python:PythonMethod.find_obj`

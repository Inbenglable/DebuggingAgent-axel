To address the bug related to the `hist()` function, after retrieving the `hist()` method signature in `pyplot.py`, it's clear that the actual logic is handled by `gca().hist(...)`, which suggests that the `Axes` class might be managing the computations. Therefore, I need to locate and inspect the `hist` method within the `Axes` class.

```python
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py", "hist")
```

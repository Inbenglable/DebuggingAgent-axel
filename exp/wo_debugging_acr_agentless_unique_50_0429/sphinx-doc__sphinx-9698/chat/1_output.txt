To resolve the issue with the `py:method` directive using the `:property:` option that incorrectly registers an index entry with parentheses, I will need to identify the relevant part of the Sphinx codebase where the index entry for `py:method` and `py:property` directives is handled.

Let's start by finding the `py:method` directive with the `:property:` option handling code to understand how the index entry is generated.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("py:method")
search_method_in_codebase("py:property")
```

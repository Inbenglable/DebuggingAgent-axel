To address the issue with the `units.quantity_input` decorator, we should examine the relevant decorator code where the error is occurring. According to the error traceback, the problem is in the `astropy` package, specifically within the `decorators.py` file on line 225. Given this, I need to retrieve the source code of the method responsible for handling `return_` within `decorators.py`. Let's proceed with retrieving the relevant code.

```python
search_code_in_codebase("return return_.to(wrapped_signature.return_annotation)")
```

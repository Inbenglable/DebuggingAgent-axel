To resolve the issue regarding the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass in the Astropy project, first, I need to examine the source code of this class. Understanding its implementation will help in modifying it to correctly handle properties. Therefore, I will search for the `InheritDocstrings` class in the codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("InheritDocstrings")
```

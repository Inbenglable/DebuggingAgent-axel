To resolve the issue, I need to review the source code of the `submit_row` method in `django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py`. This is necessary to understand how the `show_save_as_new` context variable is currently being determined and how we can incorporate the additional check for `has_add_permission`. 

I'll proceed to retrieve the source code for the `submit_row` method in the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py", "submit_row")
```

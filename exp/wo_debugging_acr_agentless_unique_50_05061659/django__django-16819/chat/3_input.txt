## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Reduce Add/RemoveIndex migration operations.
Description
	
We should reduce AddIndex/RemoveIndex operations when optimizing migration operations.

</ISSUE>


In the previous round, you called search APIs to retrieve relevant source code that would help identify the root cause of the issue and generate a patch. However, the code you retrieved appears in multiple locations (maybe some are irrelevant but have same key). So now your task is to determine which of the retrieved contents are indeed you need, and filter out the irrelevant ones.
This is your API invocation round output:
To address the issue of reducing AddIndex/RemoveIndex migration operations in a Django project, I first need to investigate how index operations are handled during migrations in the Django codebase. This likely involves checking the migration optimizer functionalities involved in managing these operations. 

I will start by searching for relevant classes or methods that might handle migration optimization in migrations, especially concerning AddIndex and RemoveIndex operations.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("MigrationOptimizer")
search_method_in_codebase("optimize")
search_code_in_codebase("AddIndex")
search_code_in_codebase("RemoveIndex")
```

And this is the corresponding API returned result (each content is started with #### FILE_PATH:NAME):
Your API invoke result:

Among the API returned contents, there may be some irrelevant ones or not. So now you need to analyze each returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.
Now, please first analyze the API returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.

Then you need to choose you needed ones with the following format:
```
FILE_PATH_1:NAME_1
FILE_PATH_2:NAME_2
...
```

Note:
1. The value of FILE_PATH:NAME, must consistent with the API returned content (but remove the prefix ####).
2. You may select one or more contents, or even all of them if they are indeed you need.

The test output has demonstrated abnormal behavior based on the issue description. The assertion error indicates that the partitions generated by the `partitions()` function are being reused. This is confirmed in the test output, where the partition list was modified, and subsequent partitions generated had the same modification.

Given this information, the root cause of the issue lies in how the `partitions()` iterator yields its result. Generally, the iterator should yield new independent objects if they are to be used and modified independently in further code execution. However, the current implementation suggests the dictionary object is reused, which results in modifications from external code affecting subsequent yields.

The current abnormal behavior comes from the fact that changes to one partition (like modifying the dictionary values) persist and reflect on sequential usages of the generator or list conversions.

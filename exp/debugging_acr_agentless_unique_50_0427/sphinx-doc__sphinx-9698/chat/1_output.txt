To begin addressing the issue with the Sphinx project, it's essential to identify where the `py:method` directive with the `:property:` option causes incorrect index entries (having parens when it shouldn't). The process involves tracing where the index entries are generated or registered, particularly focusing on the `py:method` and `:property:` handling logic.

Given the provided output, we're interested in the `MethodDocumenter` and `PropertyDocumenter` classes as potential areas of focus because they handle the documenting and indexing of methods and properties.

Let's start by observing the `MethodDocumenter` class since it relates to the `py:method` directive:

Observed method: `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:MethodDocumenter.add_content`

This method often plays a role in managing the content related to documented entities and might reveal how the incorrect index entry with parentheses is being generated.

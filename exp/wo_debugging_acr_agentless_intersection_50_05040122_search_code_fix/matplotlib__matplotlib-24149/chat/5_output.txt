To review the patch and assess whether the issue with `ax.bar` has been resolved, let's examine the provided information:

1. **Original Issue:**   
   - The `ax.bar` function raises a `StopIteration` exception when passed arrays containing only `NaN` values. 
   
2. **Reproduce Test:**  
   - The test involves calling `ax.bar` with arrays containing `NaN` values and reproduces the issue, resulting in a `StopIteration`.

3. **Patch Details:**  
   - The patch modifies the `_convert_dx` function to handle `NaN` values more gracefully by introducing a condition to raise a `ValueError` if `np.isnan(x0)`, where `x0` is derived from `_safe_first_finite`.

4. **Patched Test Output:**  
   - The `StopIteration` exception continues to occur, indicating that the introduced change did not address the issue.

The patch was intended to handle `NaN` values within `_convert_dx`, but based on the patched output, it still produces the same `StopIteration` error, meaning the proposed changes did not successfully resolve the issue. 

Therefore:

Issue resolved: `False`

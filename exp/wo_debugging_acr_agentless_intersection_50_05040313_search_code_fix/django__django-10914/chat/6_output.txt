To determine whether the issue is fixed, let's break down the information provided:

### Issue Description:

The original problem was that files uploaded to the `FileSystemStorage` were not consistently assigned the expected file permissions, resulting in a default of `0o600` on some systems. The desired default permission was `0o644`.

### Original Test Output:

Before applying the patch, the test output shows:
- An assertion failure indicating that the file permissions were `0o600` instead of the expected `0o644`.

### Patch Analysis:

The provided patch changes the default `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting in Django's global settings:
- The original line `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None` is replaced with `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = 0o644`.

This change sets the default file upload permissions to `0o644` when not specifically configured elsewhere.

### Patched Test Output:

After applying the patch, the test output shows:
- The test reports "File permissions are as expected (0o644). Issue is fixed."
- The assertion that checks for permissions `0o644` no longer fails, indicating that the permissions for uploaded files are now correctly set to `0o644`.

### Conclusion:
The patch successfully addresses the original issue by setting the default file upload permissions to `0o644`. This resolves the inconsistencies in file permissions when uploading files with `FileSystemStorage`.

Issue resolved: `True`

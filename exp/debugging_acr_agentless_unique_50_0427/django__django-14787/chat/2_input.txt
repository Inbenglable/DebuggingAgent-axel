You need to trace the abnormal program to resolve project issues and submit pull requests.
Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
method_decorator() should preserve wrapper assignments
Description
	
the function that is passed to the decorator is a partial object and does not have any of the attributes expected from a function i.e. __name__, __module__ etc...
consider the following case
def logger(func):
	@wraps(func)
	def inner(*args, **kwargs):
		try:
			result = func(*args, **kwargs)
		except Exception as e:
			result = str(e)
		finally:
			logger.debug(f"{func.__name__} called with args: {args} and kwargs: {kwargs} resulting: {result}")
	return inner
class Test:
	@method_decorator(logger)
	def hello_world(self):
		return "hello"
Test().test_method()
This results in the following exception
AttributeError: 'functools.partial' object has no attribute '__name__'

</ISSUE>


Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
import traceback
import sys
from functools import wraps
from django.utils.decorators import method_decorator

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def logger(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def inner(*args, **kwargs):
        try:
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        except Exception as e:
            result = str(e)
        finally:
            print(f"{func.__name__} called with args: {args} and kwargs: {kwargs} resulting: {result}")
    return inner

class Test:
    @method_decorator(logger)
    def hello_world(self):
        return "hello"

def main():
    try:
        test_instance = Test()
        test_instance.hello_world()
        # If the issue is fixed, the above line should execute without error
        # and we should reach this point without an exception.
        print("The issue is fixed.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except AttributeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "The issue is present: 'functools.partial' object has no attribute '__name__'"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()


This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
To understand the abnormal program behavior, let's analyze the sequence of execution that led to the error:

1. We have a decorator `logger` defined, which uses `functools.wraps` to wrap a function. This decorator is expected to preserve the original function's attributes like `__name__`.

2. The `method_decorator` from Django is supposed to wrap a method with the given decorator.

3. When applying `method_decorator(logger)` on the `hello_world` method of the `Test` class, the decorator `logger` is used inside the method decorator context.

4. The problem arises when the `wraps` function tries to copy the `__name__` and other attributes from a `functools.partial` object, which lacks these attributes, resulting in an AttributeError.

This issue indicates that the `method_decorator` is interacting with the partial function object in such a way that `wraps` cannot find the necessary attributes like `__name__`.

Based on this analysis, the buggy behavior is most likely occurring in how the `method_decorator` is handling the function wrapping.

Given this analysis, the next method to observe is the `method_decorator` function implementation to understand its current handling of the decorator and to identify where the conversion to `functools.partial` might not be handled correctly.

Observed method: `django/utils/decorators.py:method_decorator`
==================================================


Now you choose downstream method method_decorator to further observe, tracing the abnormal program behavior.
This is the method code:
    53	def method_decorator(decorator, name=''):
    54	    """
    55	    Convert a function decorator into a method decorator
    56	    """
    57	    # 'obj' can be a class or a function. If 'obj' is a function at the time it
    58	    # is passed to _dec,  it will eventually be a method of the class it is
    59	    # defined on. If 'obj' is a class, the 'name' is required to be the name
    60	    # of the method that will be decorated.
    61	    def _dec(obj):
    62	        if not isinstance(obj, type):
    63	            return _multi_decorate(decorator, obj)
    64	        if not (name and hasattr(obj, name)):
    65	            raise ValueError(
    66	                "The keyword argument `name` must be the name of a method "
    67	                "of the decorated class: %s. Got '%s' instead." % (obj, name)
    68	            )
    69	        method = getattr(obj, name)
    70	        if not callable(method):
    71	            raise TypeError(
    72	                "Cannot decorate '%s' as it isn't a callable attribute of "
    73	                "%s (%s)." % (name, obj, method)
    74	            )
    75	        _wrapper = _multi_decorate(decorator, method)
    76	        setattr(obj, name, _wrapper)
    77	        return obj
    78	
    79	    # Don't worry about making _dec look similar to a list/tuple as it's rather
    80	    # meaningless.
    81	    if not hasattr(decorator, '__iter__'):
    82	        update_wrapper(_dec, decorator)
    83	    # Change the name to aid debugging.
    84	    obj = decorator if hasattr(decorator, '__name__') else decorator.__class__
    85	    _dec.__name__ = 'method_decorator(%s)' % obj.__name__
    86	    return _dec


This is the runtime information of method_decorator:

You need to trace the abnormal program behavior step by step to identify the root cause of the bug and locate the buggy method that contains the code to be fixed.
Now, please first analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior. 

Then, if you can already locate the buggy method and buggy code, reply with:  
Buggy method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Otherwise, continue tracing by telling me the code line scope that you want to deeper observe, we will show you the deeper downstream run-time information of the scope you select. Please reply with:
Observed scope: `{FILE_PATH}:{START_LOC}-{END_LOC}`
Note that {FILE_PATH} refers to the path relative to the repository.

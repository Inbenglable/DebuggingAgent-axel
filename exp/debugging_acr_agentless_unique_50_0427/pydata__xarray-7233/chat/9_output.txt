Here is the patch in the *SEARCH/REPLACE* format to resolve the issue where non-dimensional coordinates are demoted to variables during the `Coarsen.construct` process in the xarray project:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### xarray/core/rolling.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nshould_be_coords = set(window_dim) & set(self.obj.coords)\nresult = reshaped.set_coords(should_be_coords)\n=======\n# Combine window_dim based coordinates with original non-dimensional coordinates\nshould_be_coords = set(window_dim) & set(self.obj.coords)\nextra_coords = set(self.obj.coords) - set(self.obj.dims)\nshould_be_coords.update(extra_coords)\nresult = reshaped.set_coords(should_be_coords)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch modifies the logic in the `Coarsen.construct` method to include not only the coordinates associated with dimensions specified for the coarsening operation but also any additional non-dimensional coordinates that exist in the original object. This ensures that such coordinates are not demoted to variables after the `construct` operation.

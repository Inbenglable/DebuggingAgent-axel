### Analysis of Current Observations:

1. **ImportError:**
   - The error regarding `Window` suggests that the function is either not exported from `django.db.models.functions` or moved elsewhere within Django updates. This needs correction to proceed with further runtime observation to accurately locate deeper issues when executing the test involving window functions and aggregates.

2. **Location in Query Construction:**
   - Observing `Query.add_annotation`, the current snippet shows handling of order-by operations but doesn't directly correlate with resolving aggregate-over-window constraints. It's involved with query formation through handling extra selections and order-by clauses but does not enforce SQL logic constraints itself.
   
3. **Error Pattern and SQL Constraints:**
   - The problem fundamentally lies with SQL constraint violation in PostgreSQL â€” not allowing aggregates directly on window function results, which means the logical safeguard should be in place within Django's ORM to prevent such query formations or guide outputs appropriately.

### Next Steps for Bug Localization:

Given the observation, specifically aiming at SQL constraints, it's essential to delve deeper into Django's query construction mechanisms. Since adding annotations does not address SQL execution constraints directly, focusing on the actual SQL compilation and query plan building could help identify points where enforcement or validation needs integration.

Given the insights and current focus:

- **Dependency Fix:** The test script should be corrected by ensuring all setuptools are configured right, particularly resolving the import path for `Window`.

- **Further Investigation:** Look into how Django compiles annotations for queries where SQL aggregation constraints must comply.

Thus, I will investigate another area of interest regarding how annotations and constraints are compiled or enforced in Django's ORM for PostgreSQL compatibility.

### Next Method to Observe:

I'll proceed by observing the subsequent functioning around query compilation to discover how constraints concerning PostgreSQL are structured or imposed.

**Observed method:** `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py:SQLCompiler.compile` 

This might yield insights into annotation handling during compilation and possibly uncover where the constraint on SQL aggregation over window functions could be enforced or is currently lacking.

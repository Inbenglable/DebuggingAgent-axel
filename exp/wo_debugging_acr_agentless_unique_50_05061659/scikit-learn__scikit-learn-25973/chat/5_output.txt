To evaluate if the patch resolves the issue, let's examine the key components and outputs of the test runs, before and after applying the patch:

### Patch Review
The patch involves two main changes to `sklearn/feature_selection/_sequential.py` to handle the case where `cv` can be an iterable of splits:

1. **Patch Edit #1**:
   - Introduces a check to determine if `cv` is already a series of splits or needs deriving from a splitter object.
   - Integrates logic to set `cv_splits` accordingly.

2. **Patch Edit #2**:
   - Modifies the call to `_get_best_new_feature_score` to include `cv_splits`, thereby using the correct splits for cross-validation.

### Original Test Output
Before applying the patch, the test outputs an `IndexError`, indicating a failure when iterating over potentially empty results:

```
IndexError: list index out of range
```

This verifies the issue in handling iterable splits for `cv`.

### Patched Test Output
After applying the patch, the test outputs an identical error (`IndexError`), confirming that the required logic to handle iterable `cv` was not successfully implemented:

```
IndexError: list index out of range
```

The error remains unchanged, indicating the patch did not resolve the problem.

### Conclusion
Given the identical nature of errors pre- and post-patch application, the issue persists with neither improved handling nor resolution of the original bug when passing iterable splits to `SequentialFeatureSelector`.

Therefore, based on the available data:

**Issue resolved: `False`**

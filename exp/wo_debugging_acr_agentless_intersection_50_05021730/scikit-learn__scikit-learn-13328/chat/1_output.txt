To address this issue, I need to retrieve the source code of the `HuberRegressor` class and particularly its `fit` method to understand how the input data `X` is being handled and where the conversion to `float` should be applied. 

Let's start by searching for the source code of the `HuberRegressor` class and the `fit` method within the class.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("HuberRegressor")
search_method_in_codebase("HuberRegressor.fit")
```

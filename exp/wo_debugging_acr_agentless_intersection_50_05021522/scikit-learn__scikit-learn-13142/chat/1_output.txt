To address the issue, I need to inspect the `GaussianMixture` class to understand how `fit_predict` and `predict` behave and identify why they might produce different results when `n_init > 1`.

I will start by retrieving the source code for the `GaussianMixture` class and its `fit_predict` and `predict` methods. Since both methods belong to the same class, fetching the class code will provide insight into both methods and their interaction. 

Let's begin by searching for the class definition and methods within the scikit-learn codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("GaussianMixture")
search_method_in_codebase("GaussianMixture.fit_predict")
search_method_in_codebase("GaussianMixture.predict")
```

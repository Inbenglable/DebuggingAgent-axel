Let's review the details provided: 

### Bug Issue Summary:
The core problem is that `xr.combine_by_coords` raises a `ValueError` when combining datasets with non-monotonic, identical coordinate dimensions. The expectation is that if coordinate dimensions are identical across datasets, they should not be subject to monotonicity checks.

### Reproducible Test:
The provided test attempts to combine two datasets with identical but non-monotonic `y` coordinates (`['a', 'c', 'b']`). Before the patch, this raises the `ValueError` as expected due to the monotonicity check.

### Patch Review:
The patch modifies the condition in the `xarray/core/combine.py` file:

Original Code:
```python
if dim in concatenated:
```

Patched Code:
```python
if dim in concatenated and dim not in datasets[0].coords:
```

- **Analysis of the Patch:** The patch changes the condition such that the monotonicity check is only applied if the coordinate dimension (`dim`) is not present in the first dataset's coordinates. This effectively prevents monotonicity validation for dimensions that are identical across all input datasets.

### Test Output Analysis:
- **Original Output:** The test fails with a `ValueError` as expected, evidencing the bug.
- **Patched Output:** The test succeeds without errors, indicating that the patch effectively allows `combine_by_coords` to process identical, non-monotonic coordinates without raising a `ValueError`.

### Conclusion:
The patch addresses the issue described, allowing `combine_by_coords` to function as expected for the documented case where identical coordinate dimensions across datasets should be ignored rather than checked for monotonicity. The change is specific and fulfills the requirements outlined in the bug report.

Therefore, the test results post-patch confirm the functionality, indicating that the issue is resolved.

Issue resolved: `True`

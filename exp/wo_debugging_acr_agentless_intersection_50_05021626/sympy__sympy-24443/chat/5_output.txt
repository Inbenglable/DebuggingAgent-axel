The issue lies within the `_image()` function inside the `_check_homomorphism()` method, specifically in how it tests for inverted generators in the given images for `PermutationGroup`s. Based on the implementation, it appears `gens = domain.presentation().generators` is supposed to be interacted with, which is likely how generators are defined in `PermutationGroup`.

The strategy to fix this bug involves correctly identifying inverted generators and simplifying the logic in the `_image()` function. Before proceeding to generate a patch, I need to confirm the behavior and interaction of `PermutationGroup` with generators.

Let's examine the `PermutationGroup` class and its `presentation()` method to ensure we fully understand how generators work with `PermutationGroup` objects.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("PermutationGroup")
search_method_in_codebase("presentation")
```

Based on the information provided, the issue seems to originate from the `trim_docstring` function located at `django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py`. The described problem in the issue is related to the handling of docstrings where the first line is not empty.

The key part of the `trim_docstring` function that was modified based on the issue report is the line calculating the minimum indentation:

Original code:
```python
indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())
```

Suggested fix in the issue report:
```python
indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())
```

This change suggests skipping the first line when calculating the indentation since the first line has an indentation of 0, which causes the misalignment in further processing when the docstring starts on the first line.

Therefore, with the information from the issue report and the current function logic, I can locate the buggy method without further tracing steps:

Buggy method: `django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py:trim_docstring`

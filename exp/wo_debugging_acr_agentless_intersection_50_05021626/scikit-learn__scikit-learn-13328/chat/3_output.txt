To resolve the issue, I need to ensure that the `fit` method of the `HuberRegressor` class correctly handles boolean arrays in the input `X`. From the retrieved code, it is clear that there needs to be a conversion from boolean to float similar to how boolean inputs are managed in the `LinearRegression` class.

The required adjustments can be made within the `fit` method of the `HuberRegressor` class. By coercing boolean arrays to float using `X.astype(float)`, the issue can be mitigated.

Ready generation: `True`

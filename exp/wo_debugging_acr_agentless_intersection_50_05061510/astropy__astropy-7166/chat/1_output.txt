The issue reports that the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass utilizes `inspect.isfunction`, which does not return `True` for properties. To resolve the issue, I need to review the implementation of the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass and understand how it processes docstrings. 

Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code of the `InheritDocstrings` class in the Astropy project. Since I do not have the file path of this class, I will start by searching for the class in the codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("InheritDocstrings")
```

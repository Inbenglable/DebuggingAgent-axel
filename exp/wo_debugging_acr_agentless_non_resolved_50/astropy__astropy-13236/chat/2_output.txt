To resolve the issue, I need to examine the existing code that handles the auto-transformation of structured columns into `NdarrayMixin`. This will include finding the relevant code section where a structured `np.ndarray` is turned into an `NdarrayMixin` within a Table. Based on the description, the snippet provided is an integral part of the process:

```python
# Structured ndarray gets viewed as a mixin unless already a valid
# mixin class
if (not isinstance(data, Column) and not data_is_mixin
        and isinstance(data, np.ndarray) and len(data.dtype) > 1):
    data = data.view(NdarrayMixin)
    data_is_mixin = True
```

I need to locate the file containing this snippet to properly understand the context and generate the future warning as suggested. Additionally, I will look for the file to ensure we address the issue comprehensively without disrupting other functionalities in the codebase.

Let's perform a search for the code snippet within the codebase to find its context.

```python
search_code_in_codebase("Structured ndarray gets viewed as a mixin unless already a valid")
```

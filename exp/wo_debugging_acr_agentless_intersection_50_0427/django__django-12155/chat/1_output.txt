To resolve this issue, I need to identify the source code for the `trim_docstring` method, which is responsible for the indentation logic in question. This will allow me to make the necessary modifications to skip the first line when determining the indentation level. Since the description doesn't specify the file path, I must search the codebase to locate the method.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("trim_docstring")
```

To resolve the issue, I will need to make modifications to the `ModelChoiceField` class so that the error message for invalid choices includes the invalid value. Based on the description provided, I need to ascertain the current implementation of error raising within the `ModelChoiceField` class. Therefore, I should retrieve the implementation of the `ModelChoiceField` class to understand how it handles validation errors and make the necessary adjustments.

Since the description provides partial class definition but does not specify the file path, I should search for the class in the codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ModelChoiceField")
```

The error being raised, `ImportError: cannot import name 'admin'`, indicates that the line `from django.contrib.admin import admin` in the test code is incorrect. The `admin` module in Django's `contrib.admin` package does not contain an `admin` attribute; the import should usually be done as `from django.contrib import admin` to access the `admin` module and its features appropriately.

However, the real underlying issue is related to the `admin.E108` error being raised due to a problem in the `_check_list_display_item` function in the Django codebase, specifically when using fields like `PositionField` in the `list_display`. The issue arises because the existing code incorrectly handles cases where `hasattr(model, item)` is false, preventing checking the field via `get_field`.

To trace the program's behavior to locate the buggy method in the Django codebase, we should focus on the function `_check_list_display_item` inside the Django admin check mechanism.

Therefore, to further trace the behavior and locate the root cause, the next method to observe is the `_check_list_display_item` method within the Django codebase responsible for these checks.

Observed method: `django/contrib/admin/checks.py:_check_list_display_item`

Expose warm_start in Isolation forest
It seems to me that `sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest` supports incremental addition of new trees with the `warm_start` parameter of its parent class, `sklearn.ensemble.BaseBagging`.

Even though this parameter is not exposed in `__init__()` , it gets inherited from `BaseBagging` and one can use it by changing it to `True` after initialization. To make it work, you have to also increment `n_estimators` on every iteration. 

It took me a while to notice that it actually works, and I had to inspect the source code of both `IsolationForest` and `BaseBagging`. Also, it looks to me that the behavior is in-line with `sklearn.ensemble.BaseForest` that is behind e.g. `sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`.

To make it more easier to use, I'd suggest to:
* expose `warm_start` in `IsolationForest.__init__()`, default `False`;
* document it in the same way as it is documented for `RandomForestClassifier`, i.e. say:
```py
    warm_start : bool, optional (default=False)
        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit
        and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole
        new forest. See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.
```
* add a test to make sure it works properly;
* possibly also mention in the "IsolationForest example" documentation entry;

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
Based on the provided log, the issue arises because the `warm_start` parameter is not exposed in the `IsolationForest` class, resulting in a `ValueError` when attempting to set it via `set_params`. 

From the traceback, the `ValueError` is triggered in the `set_params` method because `warm_start` is not listed in the valid parameters for the `IsolationForest` estimator.

To locate the source of this problem, I need to investigate the constructor of `IsolationForest` to determine how parameters are defined and which are exposed.

Observed method: `sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py:IsolationForest.__init__`
==================================================
The observed `IsolationForest.__init__` method does not currently expose the `warm_start` parameter. The issue arises when the user tries to set `warm_start` via `set_params`, which fails because `warm_start` is not part of the valid parameter list for `IsolationForest`.

Since the superclass `BaseBagging` already supports `warm_start`, the solution is to explicitly include it in the `IsolationForest` constructor parameters.

Before confirming the buggy method or code, I will observe how parameters are passed to the parent class and if there might be any other influential parameters involved in the `super().__init__()` call.

Observed scope: `sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py:177-190`
==================================================
The issue arises because the `warm_start` parameter is not being exposed in the `IsolationForest` initialization process, so it cannot be set via `set_params`. The `IsolationForest` class inherits from `BaseBagging`, which supports `warm_start`. Therefore, the fix involves adding `warm_start` to the parameters accepted by the `IsolationForest.__init__` method.

From the currently observed code snippet of `IsolationForest.__init__`, it is clear that the `warm_start` parameter is missing in the parameter list passed to `super().__init__()`, which means it is currently not part of the `IsolationForest` class's initialization process.

With this understanding, the root cause of the issue lies in the parameters being passed during the initialization of the `IsolationForest` class.

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve this issue, I need to retrieve the source code of the `IsolationForest.__init__` method from the `sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py` file. This code will be necessary to understand how to introduce the `warm_start` parameter.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py", "IsolationForest.__init__")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_file("sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py", "IsolationForest.__init__")

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

ModelChoiceField does not provide value of invalid choice when raising ValidationError
Description
	 
		(last modified by Aaron Wiegel)
	 
Compared with ChoiceField and others, ModelChoiceField does not show the value of the invalid choice when raising a validation error. Passing in parameters with the invalid value and modifying the default error message for the code invalid_choice should fix this.
From source code:
class ModelMultipleChoiceField(ModelChoiceField):
	"""A MultipleChoiceField whose choices are a model QuerySet."""
	widget = SelectMultiple
	hidden_widget = MultipleHiddenInput
	default_error_messages = {
		'invalid_list': _('Enter a list of values.'),
		'invalid_choice': _('Select a valid choice. %(value)s is not one of the'
							' available choices.'),
		'invalid_pk_value': _('“%(pk)s” is not a valid value.')
	}
	...
class ModelChoiceField(ChoiceField):
	"""A ChoiceField whose choices are a model QuerySet."""
	# This class is a subclass of ChoiceField for purity, but it doesn't
	# actually use any of ChoiceField's implementation.
	default_error_messages = {
		'invalid_choice': _('Select a valid choice. That choice is not one of'
							' the available choices.'),
	}
	...

In the previous round, you called search APIs to retrieve relevant source code that would help identify the root cause of the issue and generate a patch. However, the code you retrieved appears in multiple locations (maybe some are irrelevant but have same key). So now your task is to determine which of the retrieved contents are indeed you need, and filter out the irrelevant ones.
This is your API invocation round output:
To resolve the issue, we need to modify how `ValidationError` is raised in the `ModelChoiceField` class to ensure it includes the invalid choice value. This likely involves inspecting or altering the behavior of the `validate` method since that's where validation logic typically resides, although the current implementation of `ModelChoiceField.validate` does not display how errors are raised.

Before generating a patch, I need to retrieve the source code for the parent class `Field` from which `ModelChoiceField` inherits its `validate` method. This will help in understanding how validation errors are currently being raised and how we can modify them to include the invalid choice value.

I'll need to locate the `Field` class and its `validate` method to see how errors are raised there. 

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Field")
search_method_in_codebase("Field.validate")
```

And this is the corresponding API returned result (each content is started with #### FILE_PATH:NAME):
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("Field.validate")
RESULT:
#### django/db/models/fields/__init__.py:Field.validate
```python
    def validate(self, value, model_instance):
        """
        Validate value and raise ValidationError if necessary. Subclasses
        should override this to provide validation logic.
        """
        if not self.editable:
            # Skip validation for non-editable fields.
            return

        if self.choices is not None and value not in self.empty_values:
            for option_key, option_value in self.choices:
                if isinstance(option_value, (list, tuple)):
                    # This is an optgroup, so look inside the group for
                    # options.
                    for optgroup_key, optgroup_value in option_value:
                        if value == optgroup_key:
                            return
                elif value == option_key:

                code='invalid_choice',
                params={'value': value},
            )

        if value is None and not self.null:
            raise exceptions.ValidationError(self.error_messages['null'], code='null')

        if not self.blank and value in self.empty_values:

Among the API returned contents, there may be some irrelevant ones or not. So now you need to analyze each returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.
Now, please first analyze the API returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.

Then you need to choose you needed ones with the following format:
```
FILE_PATH_1:NAME_1
FILE_PATH_2:NAME_2
...
```

Note:
1. The value of FILE_PATH:NAME, must consistent with the API returned content (but remove the prefix ####).
2. You may select one or more contents, or even all of them if they are indeed you need.

After analyzing the available source code related to the issue, I have gathered the essential components needed to address the problem:

1. We have the `MigrationExecutor.migrate` method source, which handles the migration process.
2. The `Command.handle` method from the `migrate` command, which calls the `MigrationExecutor.migrate` method and prints the migration steps.
3. Exploration of other related commands shows that they predominantly use the management command's `stdout` for output.

The problem described seems to be revolving around the usage of `flush()` during the migration command's output, possibly linked to how verbosity levels are handled or how output is buffered when `stdout` is written.

Given the comprehensive understanding from the code snippets retrieved, I am ready to generate a patch to address the `flush()` functionality to ensure messages are printed immediately during long migration processes.

Ready generation: `True`

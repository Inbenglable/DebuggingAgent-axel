The patch aims to update the `escape` function in `django/utils/html.py` to leverage Python's standard library `html.escape`, which replaces Django's own implementation using translation tables. Here's the evaluation based on the provided test outputs:

### Patch Review:
- **Patch Actions**:
  - The patch modifies the import statements and the implementation of the `escape` function in `django/utils/html.py`.
  - It imports the `html` module, potentially introducing an unnecessary import statement.
  - The patch rewrites the return statement to use `html.escape` with the `quote=True` parameter.

### Test Output Analysis:

#### Original Output:
- The test fails with an `AssertionError`, indicating that the output of `django.utils.html.escape()` does not match `html.escape()` due to a difference in how single quotes are escaped (`&#39;` vs `&#x27;`).

#### Patched Output:
- The test encounters a syntax error, pointing to an issue with the import statement for the `html` module:
  ```
  import html
  ^    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
  ```
  This suggests the patch introduces a syntax error or doesn't handle the import correctly.

### Conclusion:
The patch has not resolved the issue due to the import statement causing a syntax error, preventing the modified code from executing properly. Consequently, the test cannot verify whether the changes to the escape function produce the desired output. As the code doesn't run correctly due to this error, the issue remains unresolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

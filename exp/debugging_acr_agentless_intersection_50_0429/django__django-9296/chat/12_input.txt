## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Paginator just implement the __iter__ function
Description
	 
		(last modified by Alex Gaynor)
	 
Right now, when you want to iter into all the pages of a Paginator object you to use the page_range function. It would be more logical and naturel to use the normal python of doing that by implementing the iter function like that:
def __iter__(self):
	for page_num in self.page_range:
		yield self.page(page_num)

</ISSUE>


A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
Based on the issue description and the test output, the error occurs because the `Paginator` class does not implement the `__iter__` method, which would allow it to be iterable. The test is designed to fail by intentionally not implementing the `__iter__` method in the `MockPaginator`, which inherits from `Paginator`. This results in a `TypeError` because the program attempts to iterate over the `MockPaginator` instance, but the class does not define the `__iter__` method, making it non-iterable.

Given that the error arises from the lack of an `__iter__` method in `Paginator`, the next logical step is to inspect the `Paginator` class's implementation in the Django code to see where this method should be introduced.

Observed method: `django/core/paginator.py:Paginator`
==================================================
The issue described involves the `Paginator` class not implementing the `__iter__` method, which prevents it from being directly iterable in a `for` loop. This is confirmed by the runtime error message: `TypeError: 'MockPaginator' object is not iterable`, which indicates that Python's iteration protocol methods (`__iter__` or `__getitem__`) are missing from the `Paginator` class.

The highlighted `Paginator` class in `django/core/paginator.py` currently does not include an `__iter__` method. As per the issue description, the proposed addition to make this class iterable is:

```python
def __iter__(self):
    for page_num in self.page_range:
        yield self.page(page_num)
```

This would iterate over the pages available in `page_range` and yield each page object, effectively making `Paginator` instances iterable.

Given the analysis and the absence of `__iter__` in the `Paginator` class, I can directly identify the missing method, which needs to be added to resolve the issue.

Buggy method: `django/core/paginator.py:Paginator`

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve this issue, I need to retrieve the source code of the `Paginator` class to add the `__iter__` method as proposed. 

I'll proceed to retrieve the source code for the `Paginator` class in the `django/core/paginator.py` file.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/core/paginator.py", "Paginator")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_class_in_file("django/core/paginator.py", "Paginator")
RESULT:
#### django/core/paginator.py:Paginator
```python
class Paginator:

    def __init__(self, object_list, per_page, orphans=0,
        ...

    def validate_number(self, number):
        ...

    def get_page(self, number):
        ...

    def page(self, number):
        ...

    def _get_page(self, *args, **kwargs):
        ...

    @cached_property
    def count(self):
        ...

    @cached_property
    def num_pages(self):
        ...

    @property
    def page_range(self):
        ...

    def _check_object_list_is_ordered(self):
        ...
```

Your Output:
Ready generation: `True`

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

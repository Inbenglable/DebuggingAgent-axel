To address the issue, I need to implement the `__iter__` method within the `Paginator` class. Before generating the patch, I need to retrieve the source code of the `Paginator` class to understand its structure and identify the most appropriate place to add the new method.

I'll use the `search_class_in_file` API because I know the file path based on the analysis.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/core/paginator.py", "Paginator")
```

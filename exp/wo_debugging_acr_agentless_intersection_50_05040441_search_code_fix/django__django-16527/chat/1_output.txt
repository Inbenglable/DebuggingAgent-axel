To ensure a correct patch for the "show_save_as_new" logic, I need to analyze the surrounding context and current logic in the `admin_modify.py` file. Specifically, I'll need to verify where the logic for "show_save_as_new" is implemented and gather the relevant source code. This will allow me to integrate the additional permission check (`has_add_permission`). Therefore, I'll proceed with retrieving the source code where this functionality is implemented.

```python
search_code_in_file("django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py", "\"show_save_as_new\"")
```

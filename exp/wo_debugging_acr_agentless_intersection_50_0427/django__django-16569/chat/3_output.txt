To address the issue described, we need to modify a condition in the method `add_fields()` found in the `django/forms/formsets.py` file. The goal is to ensure the function properly handles cases when the `index` argument might be `None`. Here's the patch in SEARCH/REPLACE format:

```pythony
### django/forms/formsets.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or index < initial_form_count):
=======
        if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or (index is not None and index < initial_form_count)):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change prevents the TypeError by checking if `index` is not `None` before performing the comparison with `initial_form_count`.

Now, let me provide this patch in the required JSON format.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/forms/formsets.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or index < initial_form_count):\n=======\n        if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or (index is not None and index < initial_form_count)):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

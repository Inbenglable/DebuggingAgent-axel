To resolve the issue regarding the `PythonCodePrinter` not supporting `Min` and `Max`, I need to locate the `PythonCodePrinter` class implementation within the sympy project. Once I have found the file containing `PythonCodePrinter`, I will proceed to search for existing methods related to printing operations to ensure seamlessly integrating the new methods for `Min` and `Max`.

Since this involves modifying the class to add the `_print_Min` and `_print_Max` methods, I'll start by searching for the `PythonCodePrinter` class in the codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("PythonCodePrinter")
```

To resolve the issue, I need to examine the `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` classes/methods since they are directly involved in the problem described. As a starting point, I'll search for these classes in the `django/db/models/functions/datetime.py` file where they are located.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncDate")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncTime")
search_code_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "get_current_timezone_name()")
```

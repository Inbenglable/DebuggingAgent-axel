<ISSUE>
autowrap with cython backend fails when array arguments do not appear in wrapped expr
When using the cython backend for autowrap, it appears that the code is not correctly generated when the function in question has array arguments that do not appear in the final expression. A minimal counterexample is:

```python
from sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap
from sympy import MatrixSymbol
import numpy as np

x = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)
expr = 1.0
f = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')

f(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))
```

This should of course return `1.0` but instead fails with:
```python
TypeError: only size-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars
```

A little inspection reveals that this is because the corresponding C function is generated with an incorrect signature:

```C
double autofunc(double x) {

   double autofunc_result;
   autofunc_result = 1.0;
   return autofunc_result;

}
```

(`x` should be `double *`, not `double` in this case)

I've found that this error won't occur so long as `expr` depends at least in part on each argument. For example this slight modification of the above counterexample works perfectly:

```python
from sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap
from sympy import MatrixSymbol
import numpy as np

x = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)
# now output depends on x
expr = x[0,0]
f = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')

# returns 1.0 as expected, without failure
f(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))
```

This may seem like a silly issue ("why even have `x` as an argument if it doesn't appear in the expression you're trying to evaluate?"). But of course in interfacing with external libraries (e.g. for numerical integration), one often needs functions to have a pre-defined signature regardless of whether a given argument contributes to the output.

I think I've identified the problem in `codegen` and will suggest a PR shortly.

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

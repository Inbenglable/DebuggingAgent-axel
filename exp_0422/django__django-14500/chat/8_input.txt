#### ISSUE
Squashed migration is not marked as unapplied
Description
	 
		(last modified by Markus Holtermann)
	 
When unapplying a squashed migration and the replaced migration files are still around, the MigrationExecutor mark the squash migration as unapplied, too, not only the replaced migrations.


Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import migrations, connection
from django.db.migrations.loader import MigrationLoader
from django.db.migrations.recorder import MigrationRecorder
from django.db.migrations.migration import Migration

# Setup Django settings
settings.configure(
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': ':memory:',
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=['django.contrib.contenttypes'],
)
django.setup()

# Create a minimal test migration, focusing on the problem of UFC.
class TestMigration(Migration):
    replaces = [
        ('testapp', '0001_initial'),
        ('testapp', '0002_change')
    ]
    dependencies = []
    operations = []

# Create a loader and recorder
loader = MigrationLoader(connection)
recorder = MigrationRecorder(connection)
recorder.ensure_schema()

# Record initial migrations
recorder.record_applied('testapp', '0001_initial')
recorder.record_applied('testapp', '0002_change')

# Apply the squashed migration
recorder.record_applied('testapp', '0001_squashed_0002')

# Unapply replaced migrations and observe behavior
recorder.record_unapplied('testapp', '0002_change')
recorder.record_unapplied('testapp', '0001_initial')

# Rebuild the graph to inspect the state
loader.build_graph()

# Output the current state for debugging
print("Applied migrations after unapplies:", loader.applied_migrations)


This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
The issue being described involves squashed migrations not behaving as expected when unapplying migrations. Specifically, the squashed migration remains marked as applied even after unapplying the migrations it replaced.

The code provided runs a sequence of operations related to migrations:
1. It sets up the database environment using Django's built-in capabilities.
2. It creates a `TestMigration` class that has a `replaces` attribute, pointing to two separate migrations.
3. It initializes a `MigrationLoader` and a `MigrationRecorder`.
4. It manually records the application of the initial and change migrations, as well as the squash migration.
5. It un-applies the initial and change migrations.
6. It rebuilds the migration graph and then checks the applied migrations.

The output shows that the squashed migration `0001_squashed_0002` is still marked as applied, even though the initial migrations it replaced have been marked as unapplied. This occurs due to a failure in updating the internal state of applied migrations when squashed migrations are involved.

To find where this behavior goes wrong, we need to trace the Django code concerned with loading migration states and determining which migrations are applied. This is likely in methods dealing with recording the application's migration state or updating the migration graph. 

Since the unexpected behavior is a discrepancy between the recorded state and the expected state after unapplying, the `MigrationLoader` or `MigrationRecorder` method handling applied/unapplied migrations should be inspected further. This would involve examining if unapplying should implicitly concern squashed migrations.

Let's observe the next logical segment in tracing this behavior in the `django.db.migrations.loader.MigrationLoader` method concerning building the migration graph, as it involves processing applied migrations into their final state.

Observed method: `django/db/migrations/loader.py:MigrationLoader.build_graph`
==================================================
### Analysis of Current Observed Code and Abnormal Program Behavior

The issue lies within the `MigrationLoader.build_graph` method and specifically how the "applied migrations" are managed when migrations are un-applied. From the runtime trace and the provided code, we observe the following:

1. **Relevant Sections of Code:**
   - **Lines 236-247:** Handles whether replacing migrations (squashed migrations) should be considered applied based on the status of the migrations they replace.
   - **Lines 250-256:** Determines if squashed migrations are partially applied and removes them from the dependency graph if necessary.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The method attempts to mark the squashed migration as unapplied (`self.applied_migrations.pop()` logic in Line 247). However, the current implementation does not account for the implicit behavior where unapplied migrations should also unapply the squashed migration. Consequently, the squashed migration remains marked as applied in the recorded state (`self.applied_migrations` dictionary), even though its replaced migrations are unapplied.

3. **Abnormal Program Behavior:**
   - When the replaced migrations are unapplied (via `recorder.record_unapplied()`), the squashed migration remains in the `applied_migrations` dictionary. This discrepancy results in the bug where the `MigrationLoader` incorrectly assumes that the squash migration is still applied, breaking the consistency of the migration graph.

4. **Next Steps:**
   - We suspect that Lines 236-247 contain the bug but need to trace the downstream execution when `remove_replacement_node()` or `remove_replaced_nodes()` is called (lines 250-256). These functions alter the graph state but may overlook the unapplied status of replacement targets.

### Action to Continue Debugging:
To further trace the abnormal program behavior, we will focus on how the replacement nodes (squashed migrations) are handled when the replaced migrations are unapplied. Let’s observe the relevant code scope.

#### Observed Scope:
`django/db/migrations/loader.py:250-256` 

This corresponds to the logic dealing with partially applied replacing migrations and their removal from the graph.
==================================================
### Analysis of Current Observed Code and Abnormal Program Behavior

The current focus is on the logic within lines 250-256 of `MigrationLoader.build_graph`, specifically addressing how the migration management handles replacing and replaced nodes. The key points of interest:

1. **Contextual Understanding:**
   - **Line 250-251:** The logic checks the applied status of migrations. If all are applied or none are, then it removes the replaced nodes (the initial set of migrations that were replaced by a squashed migration) from the graph.
   - **Line 253-256:** Deals with cases where the squashed migration might be partially applied. It removes the squashed migration from the graph, potentially indicating an error condition or the need for consistency adjustments.

2. **Abnormal Behavior:**
   - The provided runtime trace indicates an `AssertionError`, unrelated to the actual Django code logic but rather tied to the test setup or tooling (`dbgsnooper`).
   - This does not give a direct insight into the core logic flaw around application state handling. The observed trace suggests that we're at a critical juncture to handle graph consistency but with no direct influence yet noted on state handling discrepancies.

3. **Potential Areas to Explore Next:**
   - Observing the details when `remove_replacement_node()` or `remove_replaced_nodes()` is invoked could reveal insights into graph adjustments. These actions modify the graph's representation of migrations but may not be correctly linked with MigrationRecorder's state (which holds applied/unapplied migrations).
   - Investigating how these modifications align or interact with `MigrationRecorder` behavior is crucial — ensuring it reflects accurate applied statuses post-unapply on replaced migrations.

4. **Next Step in Tracing:**
   - We need to observe the logic that deals directly with state recording within `MigrationRecorder` methods to understand how these unapplied operations are recorded and processed.

### Move Forward

**Observed method: `django/db/migrations/recorder.py:MigrationRecorder.record_unapplied`**

This will help reveal if there's a misalignment between recording unapplied actions and graph updates when dealing with squashed migrations.
==================================================
### Analysis of Current Observed Code and Abnormal Program Behavior

Based on the information from the method `django/db/migrations/recorder.py:MigrationRecorder.record_unapplied`, the following observations and deductions can be made:

1. **Purpose of Method**:
   - The `record_unapplied` method is responsible for marking a migration as unapplied in the database schema. This is achieved by deleting the corresponding record from the migration log maintained by the `MigrationRecorder`.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - **Line 91 (`self.ensure_schema()`):** This ensures that the schema for migrations tracking is in place before any operation. This is more of a setup action.
   - **Line 92:** This line performs the actual operation of marking a migration as unapplied. It filters the queryset of recorded migrations to find one that matches the given `app` and `name` and deletes it. This action effectively unmarks the migration as "applied."

3. **Abnormal Behavior**:
   - The runtime trace indicates an `AssertionError` unrelated to this method's logic. The error arises from a file path assertion in the testing utility (`dbgsnooper`), which suggests a setup or configuration error in the test environment rather than the MigrationRecorder logic.
   - As such, this method's logic seems consistent with its description of removing a migration from the applied list, indicating that its core logic likely functions as intended.

4. **Relationship to the Problem**:
   - The `record_unapplied` method does not directly contribute to discrepancies observed in squashed migrations. It performs a clear-cut operation: removing an applied migration entry. Misalignment likely occurs elsewhere — specifically where the logic dealing with squashed migrations needs to ensure consistency across replaced migrations.

5. **Next Steps**:
   - Given the current findings, the next logical step is to trace back how the `unapplied` state of squashed migrations is indirectly manipulated or checked within the system. Since `record_unapplied` accurately handles single migration records, attention may need to shift back to how graph consistency checks infer the status of squashed versus replaced migrations.

### Plan to Continue Debugging:
Given that the inconsistency likely occurs in handling interactions between the migration graph and migration recorders, deepening the investigation into one of the methods responsible for graph updates or execution logic is appropriate. 

Considering the previous tracing sections related to graph handling concluded near logic for removing nodes, the focus may need to shift towards understanding any indirect method interfacing with migration records post-unapply operations.

Thus, based on initial observations before selecting `record_unapplied`, let's continue with examining the `MigrationLoader` build graph process concerning graph consistency methods, returning to or exploring around the previously tracked segments, particularly dealing with execution post-replacement removals.

**Observed scope**: `django/db/migrations/loader.py:236-256` 

This will encompass a broad range surrounding observed squashed migration state logic in building graphs to identify misalignments or logic gaps causing the issue.
==================================================
### Analysis of Current Observed Code and Abnormal Program Behavior

The observed code snippet of `MigrationLoader.build_graph` is responsible for constructing and updating the migration graph. It handles the status of applied migrations and their replacements, specifically when dealing with squashed migrations.

1. **Code Functionality**:
   - Lines 236-247 determine whether a squashed migration should be marked as applied. This happens only if all migrations it replaces are applied.
   - Lines 248-256 handle the graph integrity based on the applied statuses of the migrations. It ensures consistency by removing nodes or adjusting graph relationships if a replacement migration is partially applied.

2. **Abnormal Behavior**:
   - The logic fails to manage the case where the unapply of initial migrations (`0001_initial`, `0002_change`) does not automatically update the state of a squashed migration (`0001_squashed_0002`). This results in the squashed migration still being marked as applied, even after its replaced migrations are unapplied.
   - From the traceback, there is an `AssertionError` concerning the test setup using `dbgsnooper`, which likely indicates a misconfiguration but does not directly impact the logic dealing with applied migrations. It suggests that the failure to manage applied statuses correctly for squashed migrations is separate from this setup error.

3. **Next Steps**:
   - Since we've already located logic responsible for marking applied migrations, the discrepancy lies in how these changes are reflected when replacements are unapplied. Thus, the culprit likely resides around the interaction with migration state recording, possibly involving a missing update command or incorrect condition.
   - Further exploration of the linkage between `MigrationLoader` logic and `MigrationRecorder` behavior is warranted. Specifically, ensuring updates to the graph coincide with accurate applied state changes.

### Locating the Bug
Currently, no specific bug or missing functionality appears in the snippet observed — the routine seems logical. However, the missing logic required to update states during unapply might reside elsewhere.

Thus, continue tracing execution feedback from the state recorder or graph interaction. Given that the discrepancy pertains to applied state consistency, re-examining execution towards any implicit/explict state update beyond graph checks is prudent.

Therefore, selecting the next area to inspect:

**Observed method**: `django/db/migrations/executor.py:MigrationExecutor.unapply_migration` 

This method is potentially responsible for conducting unapply actions and may highlight any gaps in state updates consistent with migration unapplies, especially concerning squashed replacements.
==================================================


Now you choose downstream method MigrationExecutor.unapply_migration to further observe, tracing the abnormal program behavior.
This is the method code:
   246	    def unapply_migration(self, state, migration, fake=False):
   247	        """Run a migration backwards."""
   248	        if self.progress_callback:
   249	            self.progress_callback("unapply_start", migration, fake)
   250	        if not fake:
   251	            with self.connection.schema_editor(atomic=migration.atomic) as schema_editor:
   252	                state = migration.unapply(state, schema_editor)
   253	        # For replacement migrations, record individual statuses
   254	        if migration.replaces:
   255	            for app_label, name in migration.replaces:
   256	                self.recorder.record_unapplied(app_label, name)
   257	        else:
   258	            self.recorder.record_unapplied(migration.app_label, migration.name)
   259	        # Report progress
   260	        if self.progress_callback:
   261	            self.progress_callback("unapply_success", migration, fake)
   262	        return state

You are a PR reviewer that needs to review the patch generated by a bug repair agent and determine whether the issue is fixed or not.
This is the bug issue, which is in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Paginator just implement the __iter__ function
Description
	 
		(last modified by Alex Gaynor)
	 
Right now, when you want to iter into all the pages of a Paginator object you to use the page_range function. It would be more logical and naturel to use the normal python of doing that by implementing the iter function like that:
def __iter__(self):
	for page_num in self.page_range:
		yield self.page(page_num)

</ISSUE>


Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
## REPRODUCE TEST
```
import traceback
import sys
from django.core.paginator import Paginator

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__):
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Mimicking a Paginator class without the __iter__ method
class MockPaginator(Paginator):
    def __init__(self, object_list, per_page, orphans=0, allow_empty_first_page=True):
        super().__init__(object_list, per_page, orphans, allow_empty_first_page)

    # Intentionally not defining __iter__ here to reproduce the issue

def main():
    # Sample data
    data = list(range(1, 101))  # 100 items
    paginator = MockPaginator(data, 10)  # 10 items per page

    try:
        # Attempt to iterate over the paginator
        for page in paginator:
            print(page.object_list)
        # If we reach here, it means __iter__ is implemented, which is not expected for the issue
        print("The issue is fixed.")
    except AttributeError as e:
        # If AttributeError is raised, it means __iter__ is not implemented, which is expected for the issue
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Paginator does not implement __iter__ method.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

And this is the original output when running the test (before applying the patch):
## ORIGINAL OUTPUT
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-9296/reproduce.py", line 38, in <module>
    main()
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-9296/reproduce.py", line 28, in main
    for page in paginator:
TypeError: 'MockPaginator' object is not iterable

```

The repair agent has tried to generate a patch to fix the issue:
## PATCH CONTEXT
<PATCH_CONTEXT>
To resolve the issue with the `Paginator` class in Django, we need to add an `__iter__` method to make instances of the class iterable. We'll use a search/replace format to apply this patch without disrupting the functionality of the existing code.

The proposed `__iter__` method can be added to the class after the existing methods. Let's implement this now.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/core/paginator.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    def _check_object_list_is_ordered(self):\n=======\n    def _check_object_list_is_ordered(self):\n\n    def __iter__(self):\n        for page_num in self.page_range:\n            yield self.page(page_num)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch adds the `__iter__` method right after the `_check_object_list_is_ordered` method in the `Paginator` class. It follows the typical implementation pattern found inside class definitions by responsibly extending it while preserving existing functionality.
</PATCH_CONTEXT>

After applying the patch, the output of the test is:
## PATCHED OUTPUT
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-9296/reproduce.py", line 3, in <module>
    from django.core.paginator import Paginator
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-9296/django/core/paginator.py", line 111
    def __iter__(self):
      ^
IndentationError: expected an indented block

```

Now, please first review the patch and analyse the test output before and after the patch, to determine whether the issue is fixed or not.

And finally, tell me whether the issue is fixed or not by replying with:
Issue resolved: `True/False`

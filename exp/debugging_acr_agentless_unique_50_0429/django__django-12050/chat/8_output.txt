To determine whether the issue was resolved by the patch, let's first look at what the patch is intended to do and then evaluate the test outputs.

### Review of the Patch

The patch alters the `resolve_lookup_value` method in Django. Specifically, it modifies how values are handled when resolved:

- Originally:
  ```python
  value = tuple(resolved_values)
  ```
  This coerces all resolved values into a tuple, which causes the reported issue with lists.

- Patched:
  ```python
  if isinstance(value, list):
      value = resolved_values
  else:
      value = tuple(resolved_values)
  ```
  This change checks if the original value is a list and retains its nature. It only coerces into a tuple if the original was a tuple, thus fixing the coercion issue for lists, like in the case of `PickledField`.

### Analysis of Test Outputs

- **Original Output (Before Patch):**
  - The error `AttributeError: module 'django.db.models' has no attribute 'PickledField'` indicates that the test could not run as expected because `PickledField` does not exist in Django, resulting in a failure unrelated to the reported issue with coercion.
  
- **Patched Output (After Patch):**
  - The output after the patch is the same: `AttributeError: module 'django.db.models' has no attribute 'PickledField'`. This suggests that the test was never able to properly execute because it encounters the same `AttributeError` before reaching the code that would let it test coercion behavior.

### Conclusion

Given that the test was incorrectly set up due to the use of a non-existent `PickledField`, the test cannot verify if the patch fixed the specific coercion issue. The test setup must be corrected to use a valid field type in Django before it can genuinely test the behavior modification introduced by the patch.

Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that the issue has been resolved, as the test itself is invalid due to the use of an incorrect field and does not reach the section of code to test the patch effectively.

Issue resolved: `False`

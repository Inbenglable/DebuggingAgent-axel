To resolve the issue, I need to understand how the `InsertQuery` class handles the construction of the `ON CONFLICT` clause. This class seems to be invoked in the `_insert` method. I need to examine the relevant parts of the `InsertQuery` class to determine how it constructs the SQL query and utilizes the `db_column` names.

Let's search for the `InsertQuery` class to confirm its location and retrieve relevant methods to understand its implementation.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("InsertQuery")
```

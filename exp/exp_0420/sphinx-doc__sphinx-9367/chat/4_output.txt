The method `_UnparseVisitor.visit_Tuple` in the `sphinx/pycode/ast.py` file is responsible for converting an AST node representing a tuple back to its source code. The abnormal behavior occurs because the method does not account for the special case of a single-element tuple, which requires a trailing comma to be considered a tuple.

**Analysis of Current Code and Behavior:**

- **Current Code Logic:** The method concatenates the elements of the tuple without checking if it is a single-element tuple. The code `", ".join(self.visit(e) for e in node.elts)` assumes multiple elements and does not append a comma if there's only one element.

- **Abnormal Behavior:** When the tuple is a single-element like `(1,)`, the output should be `(1,)`; however, the method currently outputs `(1)`, losing the tuple's uniqueness in Python syntax.

The code line responsible within the `visit_Tuple` method does not differentiate between single and multiple elements, resulting in the observed incorrect output.

**Identifying the Bug:**
The issue is observed primarily in handling the concatenation logic when there is only one element in `node.elts`.

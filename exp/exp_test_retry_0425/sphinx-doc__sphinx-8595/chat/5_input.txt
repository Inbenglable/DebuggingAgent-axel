You need to trace the abnormal program to resolve project issues and submit pull requests.
Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **sphinx** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
autodoc: empty __all__ attribute is ignored
**Describe the bug**
autodoc: empty `__all__` attribute is ignored

**To Reproduce**
```
# example.py
__all__ = []


def foo():
    "docstring"


def bar():
    "docstring"


def baz():
    "docstring"
```
```
# index.rst
.. automodule:: example
   :members:
```

All foo, bar, and baz are shown.

**Expected behavior**
No entries should be shown because `__all__` is empty.

**Your project**
No

**Screenshots**
No

**Environment info**
- OS: Mac
- Python version: 3.9.1
- Sphinx version: HEAD of 3.x
- Sphinx extensions: sphinx.ext.autodoc
- Extra tools: No

**Additional context**
No

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))

project = 'Test'
copyright = '2023'
author = 'Test'

extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc']


This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
Based on the issue description, we are dealing with Sphinx's `autodoc` feature. The issue highlights that when the `__all__` list is empty, it does not influence which members are documented in a module, such as in the provided example. This results in all module functions being displayed despite the user's expectation that an empty `__all__` should indicate no public interface, and therefore, no members should be documented.

Since the problem revolves around the behavior of the `autodoc` extension regarding the `__all__` attribute, the focus should be on the areas of the Sphinx code that handle dictionary or attribute access related to module members and their inclusion in documentation.

The information given does not directly show where the handling of `__all__` occurs. Therefore, we need to trace the code where Sphinx determines which members of a module to document and examine how it treats `__all__`.

To do this, I will trace the process starting where the `autodoc` extension processes module members, focusing on any logic related to the `__all__` attribute.

Next, let's observe the method that processes module members, likely contained within the autodoc extension.

Observed method: `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:Documenter.add_directive_header`
==================================================


Now you choose downstream method Documenter.add_directive_header to further observe, tracing the abnormal program behavior.
This is the method code:
   519	    def add_directive_header(self, sig: str) -> None:
   520	        """Add the directive header and options to the generated content."""
   521	        domain = getattr(self, 'domain', 'py')
   522	        directive = getattr(self, 'directivetype', self.objtype)
   523	        name = self.format_name()
   524	        sourcename = self.get_sourcename()
   525	
   526	        # one signature per line, indented by column
   527	        prefix = '.. %s:%s:: ' % (domain, directive)
   528	        for i, sig_line in enumerate(sig.split("\n")):
   529	            self.add_line('%s%s%s' % (prefix, name, sig_line),
   530	                          sourcename)
   531	            if i == 0:
   532	                prefix = " " * len(prefix)
   533	
   534	        if self.options.noindex:
   535	            self.add_line('   :noindex:', sourcename)
   536	        if self.objpath:
   537	            # Be explicit about the module, this is necessary since .. class::
   538	            # etc. don't support a prepended module name
   539	            self.add_line('   :module: %s' % self.modname, sourcename)


This is the runtime information of Documenter.add_directive_header:




You need to trace the abnormal program behavior step by step to identify the root cause of the bug and locate the buggy method that contains the code to be fixed.
Now, please first analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior. 

Then, if you can already locate the buggy method and buggy code, reply with:  
Buggy method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Otherwise, continue tracing by telling me the code line scope that you want to deeper observe, we will show you the deeper downstream run-time information of the scope you select. Please reply with:
Observed scope: `{FILE_PATH}:{START_LOC}-{END_LOC}`
Note that {FILE_PATH} refers to the path relative to the repository.

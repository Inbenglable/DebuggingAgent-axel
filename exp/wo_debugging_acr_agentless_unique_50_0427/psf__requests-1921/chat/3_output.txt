To address the issue of preventing a header from being sent when its value is set to `None`, I need to understand how the `Session` class manages headers within the `requests` project. Specifically, I need to examine the process around setting or removing headers in a `Session`.

Since I don't have the implementation of the `__init__` method or any method related to header management, I need to retrieve more code. Particularly relevant methods could be `prepare_request` or others where headers are prepared or modified before sending.

I'll proceed by retrieving the source code for the `__init__` method and the `prepare_request` method to locate where header management is handled.

```python
search_method_in_file("requests/sessions.py", "Session.__init__")
search_method_in_file("requests/sessions.py", "Session.prepare_request")
```

To address the issue with the `CountVectorizer` class regarding the `get_feature_names` method, I need to retrieve the source code for the `CountVectorizer` class and the `get_feature_names` method. This will allow me to understand how the `get_feature_names` method currently checks for the fitted state and interacts with the vocabulary. Once I review this, I can generate the appropriate patch to ensure the method does not raise a `NotFittedError` when a vocabulary parameter is provided.

I'll begin by fetching the code related to the `CountVectorizer` class and the `get_feature_names` method.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("CountVectorizer")
search_method_in_codebase("CountVectorizer.get_feature_names")
```

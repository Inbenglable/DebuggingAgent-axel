The error message indicates that there is a `ModuleNotFoundError` due to the mislocation of the `AddIndex` class. The error occurs when attempting to import `AddIndex` from `django.db.migrations.operations.indexes`, which seemingly doesn't exist in the observed version of the Django project. 

This suggests that the likely problem is in the version or the organization of the Django code being used; the class `AddIndex` is not found because either it was moved to a different location in the Django codebase or it is not available in this version.

Let's proceed by focusing on identifying the correct import for `AddIndex` to ensure the script runs correctly. I'll trace to the file where Django's migrations for indexes are defined.

Observed method: `django/db/migrations/operations/__init__.py`

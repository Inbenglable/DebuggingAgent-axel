To resolve the issue, I need to examine the source code around the method that is expected to handle the `tzinfo` parameter correctly and the method that currently does not handle it properly. 

First, I need to gather the code for `get_tzname_attr`, which seems to be the method expected to handle the timezone information:

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "get_tzname_attr")
```

Next, I need the context of how the timezone is currently being handled in `TruncDate` and `TruncTime`. Therefore, I will search for these classes in the same file:

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncDate")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncTime")
```

After retrieving the relevant code, I will be able to generate the patch to add support for the `tzinfo` parameter properly.

Based on the issue description and the retrieved code snippet, we need to add a verification for `has_add_permission` in the conditions used for the `show_save_as_new` property. This will ensure that the "Save as New" button is displayed only when the user has the add permission, along with other existing conditions. We'll create a patch to add this condition without altering the original logic concerning change permissions.

Here's the necessary modification in the *SEARCH/REPLACE* format and the JSON format for changes:

### Patch in *SEARCH/REPLACE* format:
```pythony
### django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            "show_save_as_new": not is_popup
            and has_change_permission
            and change
            and save_as,
=======
            "show_save_as_new": not is_popup
            and has_add_permission # Added permission check for adding
            and has_change_permission
            and change
            and save_as,
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### JSON formatted patch:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            \"show_save_as_new\": not is_popup\n            and has_change_permission\n            and change\n            and save_as,\n=======\n            \"show_save_as_new\": not is_popup\n            and has_add_permission # Added permission check for adding\n            and has_change_permission\n            and change\n            and save_as,\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This edit should ensure the "Save as New" option is properly gated by the add permission, enhancing the security while maintaining the intended functionality by the original developers.

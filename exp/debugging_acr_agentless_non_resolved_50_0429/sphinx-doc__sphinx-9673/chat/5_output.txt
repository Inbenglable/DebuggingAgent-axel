From the trace analysis so far, we can see that the `Sphinx` class is responsible for setting up all user-defined and built-in extensions, which include `autodoc` and `napoleon`. However, just setting up extensions doesn't tell us where the integration issue occurs regarding the handling of type hints with the `napoleon` extension.

The problem specifically lies in the generation of documentation pertaining to the "Returns:" section. Since the `autodoc_typehints_description_target` and `napoleon` extensions are meant to work together to populate such sections, we need to trace where these extensions process the docstring content together.

Given this analysis, the next step is to observe how the `napoleon` extension processes the docstrings, especially focusing on how it interacts with the `autodoc` extension to handle type hints and return type information.

Thus, the next method to observe should involve the processing of docstrings, likely in the `napoleon` extension:

Observed method: `sphinx.ext.napoleon:GoogleDocstring.__init__`

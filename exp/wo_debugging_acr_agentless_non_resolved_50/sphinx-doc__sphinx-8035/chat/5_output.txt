Analyzing the contents returned by the API invocation:

1. **reproduce.py:104-107**:
   - This code snippet appears to be related to ensuring that private classes or methods are not documented when they shouldn't be, potentially relating to testing the existing functionality of the `:private-members:` option. This might be relevant if it demonstrates the current limitations or expected behavior we need to modify.

2. **tests/test_ext_apidoc.py:414-420**:
   - This snippet shows a test related to the `--private` option, likely generating documentation output that includes private members. This part includes a check for the `:private-members:` tag in the rst file. It might also be relevant for understanding or testing the implementation.

Both snippets provide context on the current handling of private members in Sphinx. They help to ascertain the current behavior of the `:private-members:` functionality, so they are relevant to understanding what modifications are necessary.

Based on the analysis, both returned contents are needed:

```
reproduce.py:104-107
tests/test_ext_apidoc.py:414-420
```

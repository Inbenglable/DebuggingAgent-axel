To address the issue with the `srepr` function, I need to inspect the `ReprPrinter` class, which the `srepr` function utilizes through its `doprint` method. I will retrieve the code for the `ReprPrinter` class and the `doprint` method to understand how they handle different data structures like dicts and sets.

```python
search_class_in_file("sympy/printing/repr.py", "ReprPrinter")
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/repr.py", "doprint")
```

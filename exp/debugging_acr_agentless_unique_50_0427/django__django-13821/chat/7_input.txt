You need to trace the abnormal program to resolve project issues and submit pull requests.
Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Drop support for SQLite < 3.9.0
Description
	 
		(last modified by Tim Graham)
	 
Indexes on expressions (see #26167) and the SQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1 compile-time option are supported on ​SQLite 3.9.0+.
Ubuntu Xenial ships with SQLite 3.11.0 (which will still by supported by Django) and will EOL in April 2021. Debian Jessie ships with 3.8.7 and was EOL June 30, 2020.
SQLite 3.9.0 was released in October 2015. SQLite version support seems like a similar situation as GEOS libraries which we generally support about 5 years after released.

This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
Based on the provided information, the goal is to ensure that Django drops support for SQLite versions earlier than 3.9.0. The test script you provided is designed to check which SQLite version is being used by Django and raise an assertion if it is below 3.9.0. In the test output, the SQLite version used by Django is 3.47.2, which is greater than 3.9.0, so the check passes and the script outputs "SQLite version is 3.9.0 or higher. Issue is fixed."

The program behavior seems to function correctly because the SQLite version check is successful and the script exits with status 0, indicating no error. However, to ensure that the unsupported versions trigger an appropriate response (raising an `AssertionError`), we need to check if the condition for identifying a version below 3.9.0 is working as expected.

The main area of interest for locating a potential bug would be the method or location where the SQLite version checking logic is implemented.

The `check_sqlite_version()` function defined in the script is primarily responsible for this logic, as it fetches the SQLite version and compares it to 3.9.0. Let’s start by observing this method.

Observed method: `reproduce.py:check_sqlite_version`
==================================================
Based on the provided code and runtime information, let's analyze the abnormal behavior:

The `check_sqlite_version()` function checks the SQLite version used by Django by querying "SELECT sqlite_version();" and fetching the result. It then compares the version fetched to ensure it is not below 3.9.0. However, there's a potential error in the way the version is checked against the threshold of 3.9.0 (`sqlite3.sqlite_version_info < (3, 9, 0)`).

In the runtime information, it seems that there is an AssertionError occurring somewhere in the execution flow. This could imply that something about the way SQLite versions are initialized, set, or compared is not functioning as expected.

The logic for comparing versions seems suspect because `sqlite3.sqlite_version_info` actually refers to the compiled version of the `sqlite3` library itself, not necessarily reflecting the runtime version. This might cause inconsistency and lead to failures if the version string obtained from the SQL query doesn't match expectations.

Next steps:
Let's dig deeper into the specific line where the SQLite version comparison is performed, as there might be a discrepancy in how the version is being compared.

Observed scope: `reproduce.py:28-31`
==================================================


Now you choose check_sqlite_version's code snippet 
    28	    if sqlite3.sqlite_version_info < (3, 9, 0):
    29	        e = AssertionError(f"SQLite version {sqlite_version} is less than 3.9.0, which is not supported.")
    30	        print_stacktrace(e)
    31	        raise e

for further observation, tracing the abnormal program behavior.

This is the runtime information of the code snippet you choose to observed in check_sqlite_version:

You need to trace the abnormal program behavior step by step to identify the root cause of the bug and locate the buggy method that contains the code to be fixed.
Now, please first analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior. 

Then, if you can already locate the buggy method and buggy code, reply with:  
Buggy method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Otherwise, continue tracing by selecting the next method to observe. Reply with: 
Observed method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Note that {FILE_PATH} refers to the path relative to the repository. And if you want to observe a method inside a class, please specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME.

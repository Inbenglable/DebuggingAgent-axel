To address the issue with migration import ordering, I need to locate the code in Django responsible for generating migration files and managing import statements. The relevant functionality is likely contained within the Django management commands or core files related to migrations, specifically in methods or classes that handle migration file creation. Let's analyze the API results to pinpoint the necessary files and classes:

### Analysis

- The returned search results show the `Migration` class from `django/db/migrations/migration.py`. This class defines the structure of migration files, but not how they are generated or how imports are ordered. This is potentially unrelated to the specific issue of import order.

- The rest of the search results primarily include migration files spread across multiple test directories and within various Django apps (`contenttypes`, `auth`, `admin`, etc.). These files are automatically generated migration scripts, extending the `Migration` class.

- None of these results specifically indicate a location where migration files are generated or offer potential methods or functions for ordering or writing imports in those files.

Given this information, none of the API returned content explicitly points to the root cause of the issue. Thus, I would not select any specific file from the API results as the source to address the migration import ordering issue without further investigation into Django's core migration management implementation.

### Conclusion

The necessary code is likely in the part of Django responsible for generating migration files, perhaps in a generator or writer component associated with migrations found in the `django.db.migrations` package. Hence the necessary step is to look for classes or methods responsible for writing migration files rather than the files themselves as returned by the API.

No selection is made from the current API results as none directly pertain to the logic behind ordering imports in Django-generated migration files.

Based on the information provided, the problematic comparison occurs in the `_TR56` function within the `sympy/simplify/fu.py` file, specifically where the expression `rv.exp`, which can be a complex number, is incorrectly compared using relational operators. This arises from testing the conditions `if (rv.exp < 0) == True:` and `if (rv.exp > max) == True:`, as seen in the code snippet of `TR6`.

In Python, comparing complex numbers directly with relational operators (such as `<`, `>`) is invalid, leading to the reported `TypeError: Invalid comparison of complex I`. Therefore, our previous observations and the current program behavior clearly point to these lines within `_TR56`.

Thus, we can confidently state:

Buggy method: `sympy/simplify/fu.py:_TR56`

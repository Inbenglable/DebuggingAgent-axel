To resolve the issue, I need to check how the mode is managed in the `EncodedFile` class and potentially adjust it to ensure it does not incorrectly advertise binary mode (`b`). This involves modifying methods that might expose or affect the reported mode, such as the initializer or any properties related to the mode. However, before making any changes, I should verify the entire structure of the class, especially any parts related to encoding and mode settings.

I'll first retrieve the full source code of the `EncodedFile` class to understand its current state fully and check for references to mode settings.

```python
search_class_in_file("src/_pytest/capture.py", "EncodedFile")
```

To analyze the abnormal program behavior, let's review the provided information and trace the execution:

1. **Issue Description**: The problem occurs when the first line of a docstring is not empty. Currently, the code assumes that the indent of the first line is 0, leading to a miscalculated indentation.

2. **Reported Error**: An error occurs due to the incorrect handling of docstrings where the first line is not empty. The indentation calculation does not account correctly for these cases.

3. **Function Involved**: The problem is with the `trim_docstring` function in the `django.contrib.admindocs.utils` module. The code incorrectly tries to calculate indentation using all lines including the first line, which might not have any indentation.

4. **Problematic Line of Code**: The error stems from this line:
   ```python
   indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())
   ```
   This line calculates indentation from all the lines, including the first line, which might have 0 indentation.

5. **Proposed Solution**: The suggestion is to skip the first line when calculating indentation, i.e., use:
   ```python
   indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())
   ```

Based on the above analysis, the root cause of the bug has been identified in the `trim_docstring` function. Modify it to exclude the first line when calculating the minimum indentation.

Buggy method: `django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py:trim_docstring`

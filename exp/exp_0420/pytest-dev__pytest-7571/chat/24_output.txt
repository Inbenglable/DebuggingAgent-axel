First, let's analyze the current observed code and abnormal program behavior step-by-step.

1. The issue describes that the `caplog` fixture doesn't restore the log level after the test when using pytest >= 6.0. The expected behavior based on the pytest logging documentation is that the log levels should be restored automatically at the end of the test.

2. We have a minimal example to reproduce the issue:
```python
def test_foo(caplog):
    caplog.set_level(42)

def test_bar(caplog):
    print(caplog.handler.level)
```
In this example, `test_foo` sets the log level to 42 using `caplog.set_level(42)`. In `test_bar`, the expected behavior is that the log level should be reset to its original state, but we observe that the log level is still 42.

3. From the test output, we see:
```
Initial handler level: 0
Handler level after set_level: 42
Handler level in next test: 42
```
This confirms that the log level set by `test_foo` is not being restored after the test.

Now let's delve into the logged trace to locate potentially relevant details:

- The provided trace logs show interactions with the pytest fixture and plugin system, as well as the main test session call. The `FixtureFunctionMarker` indicates the creation of a fixture but does not provide enough detail on caplog's internals.

Given the problem statement, it's clear the issue is related to `caplog`'s handling of log levels between tests. To locate where `caplog` is supposed to reset the log levels, we'll need to observe the methods related to `caplog` fixture handling.

Therefore, the next step is to observe the relevant method in the `caplog` implementation that should handle resetting the log levels. The file associated with `caplog` implementation in pytest is likely inside the `src/_pytest/logging.py`.

Next, we'll observe the probable method within `src/_pytest/logging.py` responsible for resetting log levels.

Observed method: `src/_pytest/logging.py:caplog`

To address the issue with the `URLValidator`, I need to see the implementation of the `URLValidator` class or method, as well as the specific tests that are failing. This will help in deciding whether to strip characters like LF, CR, and tabs at an early stage or handle them silently.

To proceed, I'll first search for the `URLValidator` class or method to understand its current behavior and how it processes URLs. Once I have that information, I can make a decision on how to patch the issue appropriately.

Since the issue appears to be related to URL validation in Django, I'll start by searching for the `URLValidator` class in the codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("URLValidator")
search_method_in_codebase("test_validators")
```

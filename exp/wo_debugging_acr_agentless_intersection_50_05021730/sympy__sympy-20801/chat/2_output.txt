To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code where the equality comparison is implemented for sympy objects. The `Symbol` class overview doesn't give direct information about the equality specifically for `S.false` and float comparisons. Therefore, it's crucial to examine the generic equality handling mechanism in sympy objects, possibly related to boolean comparison or numeric handling.

Let's proceed to search for the implementation of the equality method in sympy, particularly in the context of `S.false` and numeric types.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("__eq__")
```

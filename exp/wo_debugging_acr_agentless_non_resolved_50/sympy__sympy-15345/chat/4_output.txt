To resolve the issue, it seems necessary to find out how the `MCodePrinter` class handles the `Max` function. Since the `_print_Function` method of `MCodePrinter` handles generic function printing, I should check if `Max` is specifically treated or if it falls under generic function handling.

Therefore, I will search for the `_print_Function` method in the `sympy/printing/mathematica.py` file and also see if there's a specific `_print_Max` method.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/mathematica.py", "_print_Function")
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/mathematica.py", "_print_Max")
```

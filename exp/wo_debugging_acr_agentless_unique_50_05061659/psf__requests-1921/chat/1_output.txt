To resolve the issue, I need to identify where the handling of session headers is implemented within the requests library. Specifically, this functionality is likely related to the `Session` class, potentially in the method that initializes or processes headers. 

I'll start by searching for the `Session` class to find its location, followed by closely checking its methods for any header manipulation.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Session")
```

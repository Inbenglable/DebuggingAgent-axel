To address the issue, we need to locate the source code related to the `num_mock_patch_args` function, which seems to be responsible for handling the mock patch arguments. We also need to examine the relevant surrounding code to understand how the sentinel values are being checked against `p.new`. I will search for the `num_mock_patch_args` function in the code to gather the needed information.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("num_mock_patch_args")
```

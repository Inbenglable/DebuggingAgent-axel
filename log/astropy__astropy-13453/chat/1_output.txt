To resolve the issue, let's first create a minimal debugging test that isolates the problem with the HTML writer not applying the specified formats.

```json
{
    "debugging_test": "from astropy.table import Table\nfrom io import StringIO\nimport astropy.io.ascii as ascii\n\n# generate table\nt = Table([(1.23875234858e-24, 3.2348748432e-15), (2, 4)], names=('a', 'b'))\ntc = t.copy()  # copy table\n\n# Debugging scenario focusing on HTML format usage\nprint(\"HTML output with formats: (Expected formatted 'a' column)\")\nwith StringIO() as sp:\n    tc.write(sp, format=\"html\", formats={\"a\": lambda x: f\"{x:.2e}\"})\n    print(sp.getvalue())\n"
}
```

This debugging test isolates the issue by trying to output a table to HTML with the specified `formats` option. The expected behavior is to have the 'a' column formatted as scientific notation with 2 decimal places. The test will help verify whether the HTML writer indeed ignores the `formats` argument as described in the issue. Next, we need to analyze the relevant portions of the code to identify where the formatting might be overlooked.

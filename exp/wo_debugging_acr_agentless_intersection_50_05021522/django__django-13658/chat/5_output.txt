To resolve the issue, I need to examine how `CommandParser` is instantiated within the `ManagementUtility` class, particularly in its methods. Since the search results so far only show the `__init__` method, I need to retrieve the source code for the `execute` method, which is likely where `CommandParser` is instantiated based on the typical structuring of Django's management utility operations.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/management/__init__.py", "ManagementUtility.execute")
```

The problem at hand involves the `separability_matrix` function not computing the separability correctly for nested `CompoundModels` in the Astropy library. The main issue is that, when models are nested, the separability matrix indicates that the inputs and outputs are no longer separable, which contradicts expectations.

To diagnose this, we need to understand how the `separability_matrix` function and its helper functions work to calculate separability. The provided debugging output suggests that the issue might be rooted in the way the function processes nested `CompoundModels`.

Given that the separability matrix is computed incorrectly for a nested compound model, we should investigate the `_separable` function, which is internally called by `separability_matrix`, as it likely performs the core computation of separability within the model.

Let's proceed by reviewing the implementation of the `_separable` function to understand how the separability matrix is constructed and why it might not handle nested compound models properly.

Observed method: `astropy/modeling/separable.py:_separable`

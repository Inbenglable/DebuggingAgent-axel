Now You need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Migration import ordering violates coding style and isort defaults
Description
	
New migration files are generated with imports sorted by module, independent of import style. For example:
import datetime
from django.db import migrations, models
import time
The ​Django coding style specifies:
Place all import module statements before from module import objects in each section.
This guidance is the same as what isort does by default, ​as documented here. Newly generated migrations can fail isort for this reason.
This would mean migration files should instead be generated like this:
import datetime
import time
from django.db import migrations, models
For reference, previous issues related to migration import sorting: #24155, #25384.

</ISSUE>


You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue described, we need to modify the code that generates migration files to ensure that imports are ordered according to Django's coding style and isort's defaults. This likely involves updating the code responsible for creating those migration files. 

To proceed, I need to find and inspect the source code that handles migration file creation, specifically focusing on the ordering of import statements. Typically, this code would be part of Django's migration system, possibly within a migration generator or writer module.

Let's start by searching for the relevant class or method responsible for generating migration files in the Django codebase.

```python
search_code_in_codebase("import datetime\nfrom django.db import migrations, models\n")
search_class_in_codebase("MigrationWriter")
search_method_in_codebase("write_migration_file")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_class_in_codebase("MigrationWriter")
RESULT:
#### django/db/migrations/writer.py:MigrationWriter
```python
class MigrationWriter:
    """
    Take a Migration instance and is able to produce the contents
    of the migration file from it.
    """

    def __init__(self, migration, include_header=True):
        ...

    def as_string(self):
        ...

    @property
    def basedir(self):
        ...

    @property
    def filename(self):
        ...

    @property
    def path(self):
        ...

    @classmethod
    def serialize(cls, value):
        ...

    @classmethod
    def register_serializer(cls, type_, serializer):
        ...

    @classmethod
    def unregister_serializer(cls, type_):
        ...
```


==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

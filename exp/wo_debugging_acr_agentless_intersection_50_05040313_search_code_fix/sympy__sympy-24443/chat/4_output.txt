To resolve the issue with the `_check_homomorphism` method in the `sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py` file, I'll make an appropriate modification to handle inverted generators in the `_image()` function. This will involve checking if `s**-1` is within the `gens` and using the corresponding generator image rightly.

Let's create a patch that addresses this:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                elif s**-1 in images:\n=======
                elif isinstance(domain, PermutationGroup) and s**-1 in gens:
                    s_inv_index = gens.index(s**-1)
                    w = w * images[domain.generators[s_inv_index]]**power
                elif s**-1 in images:\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This modification ensures that if `s**-1` is an inverted generator within the generators set, it's correctly identified and handled, thus making `_check_homomorphism` work properly with `PermutationGroup`.

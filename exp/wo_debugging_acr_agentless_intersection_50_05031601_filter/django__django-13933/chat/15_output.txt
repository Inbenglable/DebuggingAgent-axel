Upon reviewing the provided information, it's evident that the patch has modified `ModelChoiceField` to include the invalid choice value in the error message, using `'%(value)s'`. This alteration matches the style and information content of `ModelMultipleChoiceField`, thus addressing the issue as described.

However, the test output before and after applying the patch demonstrates a problem with setting up the test environment due to a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'reproducer'`. This error occurs because the 'reproducer' module, which is apparently expected by the test environment configuration, is missing. Consequently, the test cannot proceed to verify the behavior of the validation error message in `ModelChoiceField`.

Given the current situation:
- The patch itself effectively addresses the issue at the code level by updating the error message of `ModelChoiceField`.
- The test fails to run due to an environmental setup issue unrelated to the patch, making it impossible to determine whether the issue is fixed through execution.

Hence, the determination of whether the issue is resolved is based purely on the code change, not empirical test results:

Issue resolved: `True`

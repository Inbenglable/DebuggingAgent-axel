To resolve the issue regarding the `_image()` function related to permutation groups in the **sympy** combinatorics module, we need to check the relevance of each returned search result.

The API search results show `_image()` method definitions in different modules related to `agca/homomorphisms`. Given that the issue is specifically with `homomorphisms` involving permutation groups in the `combinatorics` module, these results do not match the context and location of the issue described.

Here's an analysis of the returned results:

1. **sympy/polys/agca/homomorphisms.py:ModuleHomomorphism._image**
   - This function appears to be part of a higher algebraic structure unrelated to permutation groups in combinatorics. Not relevant.

2. **sympy/polys/agca/homomorphisms.py:FreeModuleHomomorphism._image**
   - Similar to the previous result, this function is related to algebra modules, as indicated by `FreeModule`. Not relevant.

3. **sympy/polys/agca/homomorphisms.py:SubModuleHomomorphism._image**
   - Again, this function pertains to algebraic module homomorphisms and not combinatorial permutation groups in sympy. Not relevant.

Since none of the entries from the result pertain to combination-specific functionality in the sympy library, they're not relevant for the issue we are addressing.

**Therefore, none of the results are needed:**

There are no relevant contents related to fixing `_image()` for permutation groups in the API return for this issue. I need to perform another more focused search.

The patch was intended to fix the handling of `autodoc_type_aliases` when `autodoc_typehints` is set to "description". However, the `PATCHED OUTPUT` indicates there's a syntax error:

```
IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level
```

This error suggests there is a problem with the formatting of the code in the patch, specifically with the indentation of the `_apply_aliases` method. The method introduced to apply type aliases was not properly indented, leading to a syntax error that prevents the code from running as expected.

Given this syntax error, the patch cannot successfully address the issue, and the functionality described in the patch context is not being tested or verified.

Therefore, due to the syntax error in the patch, the issue remains unresolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

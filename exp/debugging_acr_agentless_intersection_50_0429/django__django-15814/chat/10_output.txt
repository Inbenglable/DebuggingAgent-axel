Here is the patch to resolve the issue with `QuerySet.only()` crashing on proxy models:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/query.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            model_init_attnames = (\n                f.attname for f in klass_info[\"model\"]._meta.concrete_fields\n            )\n=======\n            model_init_attnames = (\n                f.attname for f in klass_info[\"model\"]._meta.concrete_model._meta.concrete_fields\n            )\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation:
- The change involves modifying the way `model_init_attnames` is computed. It ensures that fields from the `concrete_model`'s meta are used, which correctly captures primary keys even for proxy models.
- This addresses the issue where the primary key was missing in cases involving proxy models, causing the `ValueError`. By using `.concrete_model._meta`, we ensure the inclusion of all relevant fields and primary keys.

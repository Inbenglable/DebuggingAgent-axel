To resolve the issue, I need to obtain the source code for the `kernS` method, which appears to be causing the error. Since the import statement `from sympy.core.sympify import kernS` provides the file location, I will search for the `kernS` method within the `sympy/core/sympify.py` file to get more context.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/core/sympify.py", "kernS")
```

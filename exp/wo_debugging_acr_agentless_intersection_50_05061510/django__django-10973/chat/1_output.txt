To resolve the issue, we need to modify the method responsible for invoking the PostgreSQL client command within Django. This typically involves the `django.db.backends.postgresql.client` module. Since the issue description suggests using `subprocess.run` to set `PGPASSWORD`, we need to inspect the method responsible for running the client command and ensure it retrieves any necessary environment variables.

First, we need to locate and inspect the relevant method within the `django.db.backends.postgresql.client` module to understand how it's currently handling PostgreSQL client invocation.

Let's search for the method in the codebase to understand its current implementation.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("runscript")
search_method_in_codebase("execute")
search_method_in_codebase("DatabaseClient")
```

These searches should help us locate the responsible method(s) so we can gather enough information to propose a suitable patch.

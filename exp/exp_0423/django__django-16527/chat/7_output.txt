### Patch Review:
The patch adds the condition `and has_add_permission` to the logic determining the value of `"show_save_as_new"`. This modification aligns with the proposed solution in the issue description, where it suggests that the `"show_save_as_new"` flag should also consider whether the user has add permissions.

### Test Output Analysis:
- **Before Patch:** The test produces a `KeyError` for `'has_view_permission'`, indicating that the given context lacks this key. The logic associated with `'show_save_as_new'` is not directly tested as the function raises an exception before reaching this part.
  
- **After Patch:** The test again results in a `KeyError` for `'has_view_permission'`. This suggests that the patch does not address the immediate cause of failure in the test, which is the missing `'has_view_permission'` key, and hence does not directly impact whether the issue is fixed or tested.

### Conclusion:
The test cannot conclusively verify the `"show_save_as_new"` logic due to the persistent `KeyError` indicating that the context is missing `'has_view_permission'`. Therefore, the patch does not fix the issue as the test remains non-passing and unable to evaluate the intended condition within `"show_save_as_new"`.

Issue resolved: `False`

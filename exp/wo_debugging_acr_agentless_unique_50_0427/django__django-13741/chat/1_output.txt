Based on the issue description, we need to locate the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` class, likely found in `django.contrib.auth.forms`, and examine its code to determine how to incorporate the `disabled` property by default. We also need to consider the interaction with the `UserChangeForm` in the same module.

Let's search for the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` class in the codebase to retrieve its source code.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ReadOnlyPasswordHashField")
```

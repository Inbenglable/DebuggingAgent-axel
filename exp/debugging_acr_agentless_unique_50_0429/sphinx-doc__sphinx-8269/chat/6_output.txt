To determine whether the issue is resolved, we need to analyze both the provided patch and the test outputs:

### Patch Analysis
The patch modifies the `check_anchor` function to check for HTTP status codes before proceeding with anchor checks. Specifically:

```python
def check_anchor(response: requests.requests.Response, anchor: str) -> bool:
    # Check for HTTP error before processing the anchor
    if response.status_code != 200:
        # Report HTTP error, don't search for the anchor
        return False
```

This change aims to report HTTP errors directly rather than incorrectly reporting that an anchor was not found when actually facing a server error.

### Test Output Analysis

#### Original Output Before Patch
- The error encountered is `FileNotFoundError` indicating that the directory or file structure for the test environment was not set up correctly (`'/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/sphinx-doc__sphinx-8269/source/conf.py'`).

#### Patched Output After Patch
- The error remains the same: `FileNotFoundError`, with the same message and cause as before.

### Conclusion
Since the test setup itself is failing due to a missing directory or file (`FileNotFoundError`), the tests cannot execute correctly. This means that the agent's patch cannot demonstrate any impact, and the expected behavior (reporting HTTP errors instead of anchor errors) is untested.

Therefore, it's impossible to determine from the current test outputs whether the issue related to `linkcheck` is resolved. The test environment needs to be corrected to ensure the actual tests can run and validate the logic changes made by the patch.

Issue resolved: `False`

To address the issue of dropping support for SQLite versions lower than 3.9.0 in the Django project, it's necessary to focus on the relevant parts of the Django source code related to the SQLite database backend. This primarily involves examining `DatabaseWrapper` implementations that pertain to SQLite and associated classes that might handle connection or feature settings specific to SQLite.

Here is the analysis of the search API results to identify Django source files relevant for enforcing SQLite version constraints:

1. **django/db/backends/oracle/base.py:DatabaseWrapper**  
   This file is not relevant because it is specific to the Oracle database backend.

2. **django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py:DatabaseWrapper**  
   This file is relevant because it pertains to the SQLite database backend. It's likely where SQLite version constraints and connection logic will be applied.

3. **django/db/backends/postgresql/base.py:DatabaseWrapper**  
   This file is not relevant because it is specific to the PostgreSQL database backend.

4. **django/db/backends/dummy/base.py:DatabaseWrapper**  
   This file is not relevant because it doesnâ€™t pertain to SQLite, and the dummy database backend generally doesn't interface with actual database logic.

5. **django/db/backends/mysql/base.py:DatabaseWrapper**  
   This file is not relevant as it pertains to the MySQL database backend.

6. **django/contrib/gis/db/backends/oracle/base.py:DatabaseWrapper**  
   This file is not relevant because it pertains to the Oracle GIS database backend.

7. **django/contrib/gis/db/backends/spatialite/base.py:DatabaseWrapper**  
   This file is relevant because it pertains to the SpatiaLite database backend, which is an extension of the SQLite database and could have specific features or version constraints settings related to SQLite.

8. **django/contrib/gis/db/backends/postgis/base.py:DatabaseWrapper**  
   This file is not relevant because it pertains to the PostGIS database backend, which relates to PostgreSQL.

9. **django/contrib/gis/db/backends/mysql/base.py:DatabaseWrapper**  
   This file is not relevant as it pertains to the MySQL GIS database backend.

Based on the analysis, the relevant contents needed to address the issue are:

```
django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py:DatabaseWrapper
django/contrib/gis/db/backends/spatialite/base.py:DatabaseWrapper
```

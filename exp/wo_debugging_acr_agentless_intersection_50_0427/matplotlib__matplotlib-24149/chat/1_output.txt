To resolve the issue with the `ax.bar` method raising an exception when passed only `nan` data, I need to review the source code of the `Axes.bar` method and also its helper methods to understand the root cause of this behavior.

Since you've provided the traceback, I will begin by searching for the `Axes.bar` method in the `axes/_axes.py` file. I'll also need to look at the `_convert_dx` method, as it's the specific method indicated in the traceback to be causing the issue due to `next(val for val in obj if safe_isfinite(val))` resulting in a `StopIteration` error.

```python
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py", "Axes.bar")
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py", "Axes._convert_dx")
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py", "_safe_first_finite")
```

Based on the issue description and observed behavior, the problem is related to the `_pytest.capture.EncodedFile` class, which incorrectly advertises the mode of its underlying stream as `rb+`, causing compatibility issues with packages expecting a file mode that supports writing `str` instead of `bytes`.

The issue manifests as a `TypeError` exception when the `write()` method receives `bytes` instead of `str`, stemming from `_pytest.capture.EncodedFile` incorrectly handling the mode.

Given this, I will trace the `_pytest.capture.EncodedFile` class's `write` method for further insights on resolving this issue.

Observed method: `src/_pytest/capture.py:EncodedFile.write`

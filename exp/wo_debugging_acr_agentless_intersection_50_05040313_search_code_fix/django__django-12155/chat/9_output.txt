Based on the explanation and the source code of the `trim_docstring` function, the necessary modification will skip the first line when calculating indentation. Now, let's create the patch to resolve the issue using the proposed change.

Here is the patch formatted in *SEARCH/REPLACE*:

```pythony
### django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())
=======
    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, I will provide the edit result in JSON format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())\n=======\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This edit will address the issue by ensuring that the indentation calculation skips the first line of the docstring, preventing errors when the first line is not empty.

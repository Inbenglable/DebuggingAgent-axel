To resolve the issue with the separability_matrix function, I will need to understand how compound models are created and nested within the astropy modeling module. These models use operations like '&' and '|', and the way these operations affect separability matrix calculation is crucial to fix the issue. Therefore, I need to inspect the CompoundModel class definition and how it handles operations between models, specifically the left and right attributes and the op attribute used in the _separable function.

```python
search_class_in_file("astropy/modeling/core.py", "CompoundModel")
```

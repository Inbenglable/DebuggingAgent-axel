To address the issue with the `CountVectorizer`'s `get_feature_names` method incorrectly raising `NotFittedError` when the vocabulary is provided but not fitted, I need to review the source code of the `get_feature_names` method and possibly the `_validate_vocabulary` method if referenced. First, I will search for the `get_feature_names` method in the `CountVectorizer` class.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py", "CountVectorizer.get_feature_names")
search_method_in_file("sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py", "CountVectorizer._validate_vocabulary")
```

The methods `catching_logs.__enter__` and `catching_logs.__exit__` capture the logic for log level management. The `__enter__` method correctly stores the original log level (`self.orig_level`) and sets a new log level based on the minimum of `self.orig_level` and `self.level`. The `__exit__` method is responsible for resetting the log level but currently does not seem to restore the level properly.

Both the `__enter__` and `__exit__` code snippets are available and provide sufficient context regarding how log levels are being managed during a test. With this information, it is clear that an adjustment is needed to ensure the log level is restored correctly when exiting the `catching_logs` context.

As I have the necessary code for these mechanisms, I am prepared to proceed with generating the patch required to fix the described issue. The change will involve verifying the correct restoration of `self.orig_level` in `__exit__`.

Ready generation: `True`

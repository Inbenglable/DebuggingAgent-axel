To resolve the `KeyError` issue in the `MigrationAutodetector.only_relation_agnostic_fields` method, we need to replace the line that deletes the 'to' key, with a safer pop method that prevents the `KeyError` if 'to' does not exist. Here's the patch following the *SEARCH/REPLACE* format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/migrations/autodetector.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                del deconstruction[2]['to']\n=======\n                deconstruction[2].pop('to', None)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

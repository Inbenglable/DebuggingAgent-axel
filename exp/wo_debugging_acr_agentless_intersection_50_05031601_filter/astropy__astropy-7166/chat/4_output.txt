The source code for the `InheritDocstrings.__init__` method has been retrieved successfully. Based on this implementation, we can see that the metaclass currently only checks for functions using `inspect.isfunction`. We need to modify this method to also handle properties, such that their docstrings can be inherited.

According to the issue, properties are not being handled correctly due to the current implementation. Properties can be detected using `inspect.isdatadescriptor`. Therefore, I am ready to generate the patch to fix the issue.

Ready generation: `True`

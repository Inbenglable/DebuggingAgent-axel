Analyzing the current observed code and abnormal program behavior, it appears the root of the issue might be within the `_wrap_data_with_container` method, specifically, how it delegates the wrapping process to `_wrap_in_pandas_container`. The method `_wrap_data_with_container` itself seems to call `_wrap_in_pandas_container` to handle cases where output_config dictates "pandas" as the output format. 

Given the issue revolves around dtype preservation, it is likely that this logic breaks within `_wrap_in_pandas_container`. Since `_wrap_data_with_container` simply decides based on configuration and calls another function for wrapping, the actual manipulation of data is likely implemented in `_wrap_in_pandas_container`.

Therefore, to pinpoint where the dtype preservation fails, the next logical step is to observe the `_wrap_in_pandas_container` function. It is likely within this function where dtype conversion happens improperly, unless additional settings are passed that fail to account for dtype preservation.

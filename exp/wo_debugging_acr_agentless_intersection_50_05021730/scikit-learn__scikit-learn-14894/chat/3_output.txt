To address the issue and fix the bug, I'll need to modify the `_sparse_fit` method to handle the case when `support_vectors_` is empty. Currently, the division operation is causing a `ZeroDivisionError` due to `n_SV` being zero. I have already retrieved the source code for the `_sparse_fit` method. Based on this, I'm ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

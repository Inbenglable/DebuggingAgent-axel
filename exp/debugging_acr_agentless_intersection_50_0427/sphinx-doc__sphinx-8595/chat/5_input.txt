Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **sphinx** project:

autodoc: empty __all__ attribute is ignored
**Describe the bug**
autodoc: empty `__all__` attribute is ignored

**To Reproduce**
```
# example.py
__all__ = []


def foo():
    "docstring"


def bar():
    "docstring"


def baz():
    "docstring"
```
```
# index.rst
.. automodule:: example
   :members:
```

All foo, bar, and baz are shown.

**Expected behavior**
No entries should be shown because `__all__` is empty.

**Your project**
No

**Screenshots**
No

**Environment info**
- OS: Mac
- Python version: 3.9.1
- Sphinx version: HEAD of 3.x
- Sphinx extensions: sphinx.ext.autodoc
- Extra tools: No

**Additional context**
No

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))

project = 'Test'
copyright = '2023'
author = 'Test'

extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc']


This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
To address the issue where autodoc is ignoring an empty `__all__` attribute and showing all module members, we need to look into the part of the Sphinx code that processes module attributes, particularly `__all__`, during the autodoc process.

### Analysis:

1. **Issue Description**:
   - An empty `__all__` attribute in a Python module should result in no public members being documented by autodoc.
   - However, autodoc is currently treating it as though `__all__` is not present, hence documenting all members, which is not expected.

2. **Reproducible Test**:
   - The provided directory structure and configuration imply there's an example module with an `__all__ = []`, and yet, members `foo`, `bar`, and `baz` are being documented by autodoc. This is the undesirable behavior we need to investigate.

3. **Potential Cause**:
   - `sphinx.ext.autodoc` not appropriately handling an empty `__all__` list. When `__all__` is empty, the expected behavior should be that autodoc skips all members, but it seems to be defaulting to documenting all members when it encounters an empty list.

4. **Next Steps**:
   - Examine how the autodoc extension processes the `__all__` attribute.
   - We have to identify where in the code autodoc determines the members to document when an empty `__all__` list is provided.

Given our understanding, the best course of action is to check the part of autodoc where it processes the `__all__` attribute.

Thus, I will proceed to observe the method that handles member retrieval based on `__all__`.

Observed method: `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:Documenter.add_content` or any related function responsible for processing the `__all__` attribute.
==================================================
### Analysis

The `Documenter.add_content()` method in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` is primarily focused on adding content to the documentation from various sources, such as docstrings, attribute documentation, and any additional content specified by the user. Here's a breakdown of how it operates:

1. **Docstring Handling**:
   - Lines 614-628 deal with fetching and processing docstrings. If the docstring is empty, a dummy docstring is added to ensure the `autodoc-process-docstring` event fires.

2. **Attribute Documentation**:
   - Lines 601-612 process attribute documentation via an analyzer object. The method attempts to fetch attribute documentation related to the current object's path (`self.objpath`).

3. **Adding Additional Content**:
   - Lines 629-632 add extra content that might have been provided externally.

### Analysis of Abnormal Behavior

The issue with an empty `__all__` attribute is likely rooted in how autodoc identifies which members to document. This `add_content()` method primarily concerns itself with content addition post-retrieval, suggesting that the mechanism deciding what to retrieve would be elsewhere.

In this method, the focus is on processing and adding content, so the decision of what to initially retrieve is not handled here.

### Next Steps

We need to explore further upstream in the process to identify where `__all__` is interpreted to decide member retrieval. This involves locating the procedure where member selection happens, typically before content addition.

Let's trace deeper to the part of the code where the members of a module are selected based on the `__all__` attribute.

#### Request for Further Observation

Observed scope: `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:601-612`

By focusing on lines 601-612, we aim to understand how the analyzer processes attribute documentation, potentially revealing itself as part of the decision chain regarding member selection in the module.

==================================================


Now you choose Documenter.add_content's code snippet 
   601	        if self.analyzer:
   602	            attr_docs = self.analyzer.find_attr_docs()
   603	            if self.objpath:
   604	                key = ('.'.join(self.objpath[:-1]), self.objpath[-1])
   605	                if key in attr_docs:
   606	                    no_docstring = True
   607	                    # make a copy of docstring for attributes to avoid cache
   608	                    # the change of autodoc-process-docstring event.
   609	                    docstrings = [list(attr_docs[key])]
   610	
   611	                    for i, line in enumerate(self.process_doc(docstrings)):
   612	                        self.add_line(line, sourcename, i)

This is the runtime information of the code snippet you choose to observed in Documenter.add_content:




You need to trace the abnormal program behavior step by step to identify the root cause of the bug and locate the buggy method that contains the code to be fixed.
Now, please first analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior. 

Then, if you can already locate the buggy method and buggy code, reply with:

To properly resolve the issue, I need to gather the source code for the `as_sql` methods of both `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` classes, which are crucial for understanding and modifying the handling of the `tzinfo` parameter. Given that the `as_sql` method extracts the current timezone unconditionally, this is where the patch should be applied to support passing a `tzinfo` object.

I'll retrieve the full `as_sql` method definition for both classes to ensure I have the complete context to implement the fix.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncDate.as_sql")
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncTime.as_sql")
```

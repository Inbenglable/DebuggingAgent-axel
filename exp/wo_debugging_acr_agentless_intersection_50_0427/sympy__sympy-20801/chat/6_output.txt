Based on the issue and the API call results, we need to focus on the equality method in the `sympy.core.numbers.Float` and `sympy.core.numbers.BooleanFalse` classes, as these are directly relevant to the comparison between floating-point numbers and Boolean constants.

Analyzing the returned API contents:

1. **sympy/plotting/intervalmath/interval_arithmetic.py:interval.__eq__**  
   - This method is related to interval comparisons and not to the core number equality in Sympy.
   
2. **sympy/plotting/intervalmath/interval_membership.py:intervalMembership.__eq__**  
   - This method is for interval membership; it's unrelated to numeric equality comparisons.

3. **sympy/physics/optics/medium.py:Medium.__eq__**  
   - This method handles `Medium` refractive index comparisons, unrelated to numeric equality in Sympy.

4. **sympy/physics/vector/frame.py:CoordinateSym.__eq__**  
   - This method compares `CoordinateSym` objects, which is unrelated to numeric equality in Sympy.

5. **sympy/physics/vector/vector.py:Vector.__eq__**  
   - This method tests for equality between vectors, which is not directly related to numeric equality in Sympy.

6. **sympy/physics/vector/dyadic.py:Dyadic.__eq__**  
   - This method is for dyadic object comparisons, which is unrelated to numeric equality in Sympy.

7. **sympy/physics/units/dimensions.py:Dimension.__eq__**  
   - This method checks equality for `Dimension` objects, unrelated to numeric equality in Sympy.

8. **sympy/core/basic.py:Basic.__eq__**  
   - This could be relevant as it mentions symbolic equality and sympification, but this is more general than just numeric comparison.

9. **sympy/core/containers.py:Tuple.__eq__**  
   - This method is relevant for `Tuple` but not directly for numeric equality in Sympy.

10. **sympy/core/logic.py:Logic.__eq__** and more, until **sympy/codegen/array_utils.py:_RecognizeMatOp.__eq__**  
   - These methods handle equality for various objects and data types, mostly unrelated and too general compared to what we need specifically for numeric equality involving Booleans and floats.
   
The task is focused on identifying classes and methods specifically relating Booleans and floats in the `sympy.core.numbers` module, typically `Float.__eq__` and `BooleanFalse.__eq__`.

None of these appear to relate directly to handling BooleanFalse or float equality in the expected way; thus, the results do not provide the implementation for `BooleanFalse.__eq__` or `Float.__eq__` specifically within the `sympy.core.numbers`.

Considering the immediate relevance to `sympy.core.numbers.BooleanFalse` and the `Float` class in Sympy core, the above methods were all related to other functionality or entities within Sympy and were not needed based on their specifics regarding `__eq__`. Therefore we need to re-evaluate if we have received those specific contents elsewhere or need another request for those core pieces of code.

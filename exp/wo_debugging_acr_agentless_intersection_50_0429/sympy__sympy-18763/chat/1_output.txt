To address the issue of incorrect parenthesizing of `Subs` in LaTeX output within the Sympy project, it's crucial to examine and potentially adjust the method responsible for generating LaTeX representations of `Subs` objects. This typically involves updating the LaTeX printer for `Subs` to ensure appropriate parenthesization.

The next logical step is to locate the relevant method that deals with the LaTeX representation of `Subs`. Since `Subs` is a class in Sympy, I'll first look for its location in the codebase. Once I have the class, I can investigate where LaTeX printing is being handled.

I will proceed with the necessary code searches now:

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Subs")
```

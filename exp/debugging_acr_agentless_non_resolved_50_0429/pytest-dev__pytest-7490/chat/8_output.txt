Analyzing the current situation, the code snippet from the `Session.collect` method focuses on clearing cache collections which don't directly relate to the issue we're facing. The runtime information indicates a failure to collect tests, which implies the issue lies further back in either path resolution or initial test collection setup before caches are cleared.

The error message explicitly states "file not found: reproducer.py::test_xfail_test," indicating that the system is not resolving the file path correctly.

The `Session.collect` method is responsible for initiating test collection, but the resolution and discovery mechanism which determines whether a path is valid seems to be failing. The primary problems likely lie in the methods that process or utilize file paths and markers for test resolution, something akin to the test collection logic within `_collect`.

To find the root cause, I need to investigate how stored or incoming paths are interpreted and verified within the `_collect` method in `Session`. This method will give more detailed insights into the test resolution and processing mechanism.

Observed method: `src/_pytest/main.py:Session._collect`

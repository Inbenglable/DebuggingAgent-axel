To resolve the issue of adding DISTINCT support for Avg and Sum aggregates, I need to gather information on how aggregates are implemented in Django, particularly focusing on the classes or methods that define Avg and Sum. This will help me understand where to allow the DISTINCT option. Let's start by locating the source code for the `Avg` and `Sum` aggregates.

Since I don't have the file path for these aggregates directly, I'll need to search for them within the codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Avg")
search_class_in_codebase("Sum")
```

The problem reported involves the `ds.Coarsen.construct` method in the **xarray** project, where non-dimensional coordinates are demoted to variables rather than remaining as coordinates.

**Test Explanation:**
- A test is set up to verify this issue. A `DataArray` with coordinate `day` is created. After using the `.coarsen()` and `.construct()` methods, an assertion checks if `day` remains a coordinate in the resulting dataset.
- **Original Output:** The test fails, indicating `day` was not treated as a coordinate as expected, confirming the issue exists.
  
**Patch Explanation:**
- The patch modifies `xarray/core/rolling.py`, specifically how `should_be_coords` is computed.
- Instead of only considering intersection between `window_dim` and current coordinates, it expands `should_be_coords` to also include variables that are present in the original dataset's coordinates.
- **Patched Version:** The test output states "The issue is fixed," which implies that after applying the patch, the issue is resolved.

**Issue Resolution:**
- The change in logic in the patch should correctly handle non-dimensional coordinates to ensure they remain as coordinates after the operation.
- The successful test output after applying the patch indicates that `day` now remains as a coordinate, meeting the expected behavior described in the issue report.

Thus, based on the analysis of the patch and the change in test results:

Issue resolved: `True`

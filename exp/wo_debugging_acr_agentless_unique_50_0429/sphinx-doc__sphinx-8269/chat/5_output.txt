Upon reviewing the API's returned content, we should focus on methods or classes directly related to the link-check functionality in the Sphinx project. The problem with the link check is regarding anchors and HTTP status codes. The given contents are from test files related to C and C++ domains, which typically involve testing language-specific domain objects rather than general functionality like link-checking. Therefore, they are unlikely to be directly related to the link-check functionality within Sphinx.

Thus, the returned results appear to be related to specific domain testing and not the general link check mechanism responsible for processing HTTP status codes and anchor checks.

Hence, none of these contents seem relevant to resolving the specific issue with Sphinx's link-check functionality.

Since none of these results are directly concerned with HTTP link checking, none of the results are needed:

In order to address the issue regarding dynamically adding an xfail marker in pytest 6, we need to understand how pytest handles test markers, specifically the xfail marker in the context of dynamically adding it during a test's execution. 

We should look into the implementation details of relevant functions or components in pytest that deal with test markers and the handling of xfail conditions. This requires searching the pytest codebase for relevant methods or classes that might be responsible for this behavior change between pytest 5.x and 6.x.

Here's the approach I will take:
1. Search for functions related to adding markers to nodes, especially focusing on `add_marker`.
2. Search for conditions or code related to the handling of `xfail`.
3. Inspect any changes related to xfail or marker handling between the pytest versions.

Let's start by searching for relevant methods in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("add_marker")
search_method_in_codebase("handle_xfail")
```

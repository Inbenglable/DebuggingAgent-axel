Based on the provided information and analysis:

**Patch Review:**
The patch aims to address the missing import statement issue in the generated migration file. It modifies the `TypeSerializer.serialize` method in `django/db/migrations/serializer.py` to include the import statement for `models`.

**Original and Patched Test Output Analysis:**
Both the original and patched outputs show the same `NameError: name 'models' is not defined` error during the execution of the test script. There is no indication that the patch has altered the behavior or resolved the issue.

The expected resolution was that after applying the patch, the import statement would be correctly added, thus preventing the `NameError`. However, it seems that the same error persists.

**Conclusion:**
The problem is not resolved because the patched output is identical to the original output, meaning the error still occurs.

Issue resolved: `False`

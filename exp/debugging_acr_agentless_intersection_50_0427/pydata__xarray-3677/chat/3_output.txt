Analyzing the current observed code, the issue arises when the `coerce_pandas_values` function tries to iterate over `obj.items()`. This is problematic because `obj` is expected to be a dictionary-like object, but it includes a `DataArray` that does not have an `items()` method. This indicates that the handling of `DataArray` objects within the `merge_core` function is incorrect. 

From the stack trace:
- The `ds.merge(da)` invokes the `dataset_merge_method`.
- It calls `merge_core`, which then calls `coerce_pandas_values`.
- The error occurs due to incorrect assumptions about the format or type of objects being passed to `coerce_pandas_values`.

The buggy behavior points towards the `coerce_pandas_values` function not properly identifying or converting `DataArray` objects within the merge operation process.

Therefore, the buggy method is:

Buggy method: `xarray/core/merge.py:coerce_pandas_values`

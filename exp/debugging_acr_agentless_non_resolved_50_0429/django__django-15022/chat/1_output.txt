The error message "Apps aren't loaded yet" is a typical indication that Django's application registry isn't ready when you try to perform an operation like migration or database query. This usually happens because Django expects certain initial setup operations to be completed before interacting with the database or accessing models.

The script attempts to test a Django project by setting up configuration settings manually and then running migrations. The issue arises because Django apps haven't been fully initialized before executing `call_command('migrate', verbosity=0)`. This initialization process normally occurs during the standard Django startup procedure when you run the server or tests via the command line, which sufficiently sets up the application registry.

Let's trace the problematic step, which involves preparing the Django application state correctly before performing the migration:

To address the issue, it's essential to understand how the `get_feature_names` method is currently implemented. This will help in determining whether the method needs modification to handle the case where a vocabulary is provided but the vectorizer has not been explicitly fitted. Based on the issue description, I don't have the source code for the `get_feature_names` method yet. Therefore, I need to locate and retrieve it from the scikit-learn codebase.

Here's the approach I'll take:
1. First, identify the file location of the `CountVectorizer` class, which likely contains the `get_feature_names` method.
2. Then, retrieve the implementation of the `get_feature_names` method from the identified file.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("get_feature_names")
search_class_in_codebase("CountVectorizer")
```

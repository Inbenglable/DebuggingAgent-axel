To address the bug issue, I need to analyze the contents returned by the API and determine the relevance of each in resolving the issue with the `subs()` method and the `PolynomialError`. Here's the analysis of each returned content:

1. **sympy/strategies/tools.py:subs** - This function performs simultaneous exact substitution, which might be relevant to understand how substitution is processed internally within SymPy. This could help verify if the error is connected to the substitution mechanism involving real symbols and `Piecewise`.

2. **sympy/strategies/rl.py:subs** - This is a simple substitution implementation that replaces expressions exactly. It might not be directly relevant as it is a basic substitution routine that doesn't seem to account for complexities, such as handling within `Piecewise` or polynomial checks.

Considering the context of the bug and the need for understanding how `subs()` handles expressions with potential polynomial errors, I would prioritize looking into the first file that slightly more elaborate in dealing with substitutions. Thus, here is the chosen file for further analysis:

```
sympy/strategies/tools.py:subs
```

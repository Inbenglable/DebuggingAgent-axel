To resolve the issue regarding how the `linkcheck` command in Sphinx reports errors when the server responds with an error status code and `linkcheck_anchors` is set to `True`, I need to analyze and filter the relevant contents from the API results. Here's the analysis of each returned content:

#### reproduce.py:30-36
This provides a code snippet for reproducing the environment where `linkcheck_anchors` is set to `True`. However, this doesn't directly relate to code handling or reporting errors; it's related to the setup for reproducing the issue.

#### tests/test_build_linkcheck.py:91-97
These are test configurations related to link checking but don't specifically provide handling or processing logic for how errors are reported in `linkcheck`.

#### tests/roots/test-linkcheck/conf.py:1-4
The configuration setup with `linkcheck_anchors = True`, but similar to `reproduce.py`, it relates to the setup without handling the issue directly.

#### tests/roots/test-linkcheck-localserver/conf.py:1-2
Another configuration setup, indicating `linkcheck_anchors = True`, similar to above.

#### sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py:377-383
This code snippet is directly related to the implementation of `linkcheck`. It defines the configuration value for `linkcheck_anchors`, indicating that this is around the area where errors related to anchors might be addressed in the actual logic. This content seems relevant to the issue.

After analyzing each piece, the most relevant content for understanding and potentially resolving the issue seems to be:

```plaintext
sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py:377-383
```

To assess whether the issue is resolved, let's review the actions taken:

### Patch Review
The patch introduced a change in the `is_fits` function within the `astropy/io/fits/connect.py` file. Here's a breakdown of the modification:

- **Original Code**:
  ```python
  return isinstance(args[0], (HDUList, TableHDU, BinTableHDU, GroupsHDU))
  ```

- **Patched Code**:
  ```python
  return len(args) > 0 and isinstance(args[0], (HDUList, TableHDU, BinTableHDU, GroupsHDU))
  ```

This change adds a conditional check, ensuring `args` is not empty before accessing `args[0]`. This avoids the `IndexError` when `args` is empty, which was the cause of the bug.

### Test Output Analysis
#### Original Test Output
The original test produced the expected `IndexError`:
```
IndexError: tuple index out of range
```

#### Patched Test Output
The test output after applying the patch is empty, which indicates no exception occurred. This implies that the function executed without encountering the issue.

### Conclusion
Based on the patch that introduces a safety condition to prevent accessing an out-of-bound index and the fact that the test output shows no errors, the issue has been resolved.

**Issue resolved: `True`**

To resolve the issue, modifications should be made within the `Aggregate` class, which has a parameter `allow_distinct` set to `False`. To enable `DISTINCT` support, we need to change this to `True` for the `Avg` and `Sum` classes. 

I need to confirm the presence of the `as_sql` method as part of the `Aggregate` class to understand its function and see how the changes can integrate. Let's retrieve the source code for this particular method.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Aggregate.as_sql")
```

Based on the information gathered, the `_save` method in the `FileSystemStorage` class already handles the application of `file_permissions_mode` using `os.chmod`. However, the default value for `file_permissions_mode` might not be set in this class, which leads to inconsistencies mentioned in the issue.

To resolve this, we need to set `0o644` as the default value of `file_permissions_mode` when `FileSystemStorage` instance is initialized.

I have got the necessary information from the source code to make a change for setting the default `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION`. Specifically, we can make amendments in the `__init__` method of the `FileSystemStorage` class.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/files/storage.py", "FileSystemStorage.__init__")
```

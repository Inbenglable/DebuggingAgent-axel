To resolve the issue at hand, I need to investigate further how the `multiply` method, along with the `_prepare_then_do_arithmetic` method, handles mask propagation. Specifically, I need to understand the logic inside `_prepare_then_do_arithmetic` since the `multiply` method is essentially a wrapper that calls this function with `np.multiply`. Therefore, the key source code I need lies in the definition of `_prepare_then_do_arithmetic`.

I'll proceed to find and inspect the code of `_prepare_then_do_arithmetic`, which seems to be central to the arithmetic operations involving masks. From the snippet provided, this function should be part of the `NDArithmeticMixin` file where the `multiply` method is located. 

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py", "_prepare_then_do_arithmetic")
```

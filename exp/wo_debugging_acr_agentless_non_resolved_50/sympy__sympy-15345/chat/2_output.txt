The `mathematica_code` function in the sympy codebase utilizes the `MCodePrinter` class to convert expressions to Mathematica code. It is likely that the handling of the `Max` function takes place within the `MCodePrinter` class or one of its methods. To resolve the issue, I need to find the implementation of the `MCodePrinter` class.

To proceed, I will search for the `MCodePrinter` class within the `sympy/printing/mathematica.py` file to understand how it handles the `Max` function.

```python
search_class_in_file("sympy/printing/mathematica.py", "MCodePrinter")
```

Based on the overview provided for the `write` methods, particularly in the `astropy/io/ascii/html.py` file with `HTML.write`, I noticed that the `formats` argument is not explicitly handled within the HTML table writing process.

To address this issue, modifications are needed for the `write` function to correctly apply formatting functions as specified by the `formats` argument.

The necessary method has been retrieved; no further code is needed to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

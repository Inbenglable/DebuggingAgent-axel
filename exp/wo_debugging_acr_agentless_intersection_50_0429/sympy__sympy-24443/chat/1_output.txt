To resolve the issue with `_check_homomorphism` in `sympy`, I need to retrieve the source code for the `_check_homomorphism` method to understand its implementation, especially how the `_image()` function is handling the `PermutationGroup` case. Since I do not have information about the exact file path, I will search for the method within the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("_check_homomorphism")
```

To resolve the issue with the `HuberRegressor` class, we need to ensure that the input `X` is converted to `float` if it is a boolean array, similar to how it works with other regressors like `LinearRegression`. This change likely needs to be applied in the `fit` method of the `HuberRegressor` class to handle boolean arrays properly.

I'll start by locating the source code for the `HuberRegressor` class and its `fit` method. This will help us identify the right place to implement the fix.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("HuberRegressor")
search_method_in_codebase("HuberRegressor.fit")
```

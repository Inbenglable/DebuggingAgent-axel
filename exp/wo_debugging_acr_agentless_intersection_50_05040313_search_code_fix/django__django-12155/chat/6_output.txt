To evaluate whether the issue has been resolved, let's consider both the patch and the test outputs before and after applying it.

1. **Patch Review**:
   - The patch is applied to the `trim_docstring` function in `django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py`.
   - The original code calculates indentation from all lines of a docstring:
     ```python
     indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())
     ```
   - The patch modifies this by excluding the first line from the indentation calculation, which is in line with the suggested fix in the issue:
     ```python
     indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())
     ```

2. **Test Outputs Analysis**:
   - The provided test script intends to reproduce the issue but encounters an unrelated problem, specifically an `ImportError`:
     ```
     ImportError: cannot import name 'simplify_exception'
     ```
   - The same `ImportError` is present both before and after applying the patch.
   - The test does not seem to proceed past this import error, meaning it never tests the docstring indentation issue described in the `ISSUE`.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The change made in the patch aligns with the described fix in the `ISSUE`, which likely addresses the indentation problem in `trim_docstring`.
   - However, the test is unable to run properly due to import errors unrelated to the docstring indentation bug.
   - Without adjustments to the test script to resolve the `ImportError`, it is not possible to conclusively verify the effectiveness of the patch through this test.

Based on the above analysis, the issue of the `ImportError` prevents determining if the original docstring issue is resolved from the test perspective. Nevertheless, the patch logically seems to address the docstring indentation issue.

**Issue resolved: `False`**

The verdict here is based on the inability of the current test to verify the patch due to the unrelated `ImportError`. Fixing the test environment error is necessary to conclusively resolve the issue via testing.

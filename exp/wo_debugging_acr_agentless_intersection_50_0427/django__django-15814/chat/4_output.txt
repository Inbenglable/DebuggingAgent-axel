I have gathered enough code context in the snippets provided. The issue arises in handling proxy models when using `select_related()` and `only()` because the current code doesn't consider the concrete model metadata. The problem can be resolved by accessing the concrete model's metadata.

I am now ready to generate the patch for this issue by replacing `opts = cur_model._meta` with `opts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta`.

Ready generation: `True`

To address the `UnicodeDecodeError` caused when using a Unicode method name in Requests on Python 2.7.2, we need to ensure that all method names are properly encoded as strings rather than unicode. This can be resolved by explicitly converting the method name to a string at the point of assignment or usage.

To proceed, I need to search for and gather the source code surrounding the usage of `method.upper()` within the `sessions.py` file as highlighted in the error description. This will allow us to implement a change that ensures the method name is cast to a string before being processed.

Here is the search query to retrieve the relevant source code:

```python
search_code_in_file("requests/sessions.py", "req.method = method.upper()")
```

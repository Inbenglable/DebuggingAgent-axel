Given the information gathered from the `LogCaptureFixture` class and its methods, we have identified the source code necessary to address the issue with the `caplog` fixture not restoring the log level of the handler after the test.

The problem is that while `set_level` does set the handler level, the `_finalize` method does not restore it since it is only restoring logger levels from `_initial_logger_levels`, which does not track the handler's level.

To resolve the issue, we should update `_finalize` to also restore the original level of `caplog.handler`. We know the original level of the handler needs to be tracked in `_initial_logger_levels` similarly to how logger levels are tracked.

Therefore, I'm ready to generate the patch to fix the issue.

Ready generation: `True`

Based on the API returned content, my task involves understanding the `FileField` class in the Django project, specifically looking at its `deconstruct` method. 

Here's the analysis of each returned piece of code:

1. **django/db/models/fields/files.py:FileField**: This file contains the `FileField` class used in Django models. It includes the definition for `deconstruct` method, which is exactly what we need to inspect in order to understand why it's failing to handle callable storages properly. This is relevant to our issue.

2. **django/forms/fields.py:FileField**: This file also defines a `FileField` class, but it's related to forms, not models. Model fields and form fields serve different purposes in Django. The issue at hand relates to model field deconstruction during migrations, meaning this file is not relevant to the current issue.

Based on this analysis, the relevant content is:

```
django/db/models/fields/files.py:FileField
```

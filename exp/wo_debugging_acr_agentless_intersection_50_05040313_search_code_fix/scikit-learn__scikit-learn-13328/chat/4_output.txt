To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code of the `fit` method of the `HuberRegressor` class to determine where type conversion should be implemented. This will involve retrieving the specific implementation details of the `fit` method. Therefore, I will now retrieve the source code.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/linear_model/huber.py", "HuberRegressor.fit")
```

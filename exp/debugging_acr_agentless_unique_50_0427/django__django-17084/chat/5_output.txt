Analyzing the observed code and the abnormal program behavior:

1. The error encountered during the script execution is: 
   ```plaintext
   ImportError: cannot import name 'Window' from 'django.db.models.functions'
   ```

2. This indicates that the `Window` class is not located in the `django.db.models.functions` module. This is confirmed by the exception traceback in the output.

3. The `Window` class is actually located in `django.db.models.expressions`, not `django.db.models.functions`.

Given these observations, the issue is with the incorrect import statement.

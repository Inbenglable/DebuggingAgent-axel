Upon analyzing the API returned content, the relevant code segments for investigating the issue with the **matplotlib** project are:

1. `lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py:hist` - This function in **pyplot.py** seems to call the `hist()` method on the current axes object, encapsulating the actual logic within another function, which suggests that it is relatively a wrapper function.
   
2. `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py:Axes.hist` - This method in **_axes.py** contains the actual code logic for creating histograms, including the handling of the `range` and `density` parameters. Based on the bug description, this is likely where the problem lies, as it deals directly with the parameters that are causing the issue.

Given the information, the primary issue seems to be within the logic of `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py:Axes.hist`, as this method directly implements the histogram functionality and parameters handling, unlike the function in **pyplot.py** which likely serves as a simpler interface/output for users.

Thus, the relevant contents for debugging the issue are:

```
lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py:hist
lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py:Axes.hist
```

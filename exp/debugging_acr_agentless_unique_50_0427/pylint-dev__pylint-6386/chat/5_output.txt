The error traceback provided suggests that the program faced an issue during the execution of `_parse_command_line_configuration` method. This method resides in `pylint/config/arguments_manager.py` and is responsible for parsing command line arguments using `self._arg_parser`, a typical `argparse.ArgumentParser` instance. The error reported is related to the argument handling for the `-v` option which expects an argument despite its equivalent long form `--verbose` not expecting one. This behavior is typically defined during the setup of argument parser.

### Analysis:
- The `SystemExit` implies that the argument parsing fails due to incorrect configuration regarding `-v`.
- Lines 258 - 260 involve the core parsing operation with `self._arg_parser.parse_known_args(arguments, self.config)`. The issue likely resides either in how the argument parser is set up initially or in its expected behavior for `-v`.

### Probable Area of Bug:
The primary suspect is the initialization process of argument parsers, particularly where arguments are defined, possibly in a place where the `-v` or `--verbose` options are configured.

### Next Steps:
To pinpoint the error, it's essential to explore how the argument parser (`self._arg_parser`) is initialized and configured with verbose options. This likely sits outside of the shown method, in the area responsible for initializing the argument parser's options and settings.

Thus, I will now delve deeper into understanding how `self._arg_parser` is configured to handle the verbose flag options.

Observed scope: `pylint/config/arguments_manager.py:1-251`

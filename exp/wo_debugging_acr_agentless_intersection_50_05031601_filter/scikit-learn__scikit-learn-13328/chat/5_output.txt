Based on the provided information:

1. **Patch Context and Changes Made**:
   - A line of code `X = X.astype(float)` has been added immediately after the `check_X_y` function call in `sklearn/linear_model/huber.py`. This ensures that any boolean array passed to `HuberRegressor.fit` is converted to float, which addresses the reported `TypeError`.

2. **Original Output**:
   - The test resulted in a `TypeError` indicating that the numpy boolean negative operation is not supported, suggesting that boolean inputs were not handled correctly in the original code.

3. **Patched Output**:
   - The test output states "Issue is fixed." This indicates the test was successfully executed without raising an exception, suggesting that the patch effectively resolved the `TypeError`.

Given the patch context, the addition of `X = X.astype(float)` ensures compatibility with boolean arrays, which solves the initial problem reported in the issue. The change aligns with the behavior where other models like `LinearRegression` convert input types appropriately.

**Conclusion**:
- The patch fixes the `TypeError` by appropriately handling boolean inputs.
- The test confirms successful execution without errors after the patch.

Issue resolved: `True`

To address the issue with the `OPTICS` clustering method in scikit-learn when the `min_samples` parameter is provided as a float, we need to create a debugging test that isolates the problem, ensuring it replicates the error as succinctly as possible. The error stems from trying to use a float as a parameter where an integer is expected, specifically when instantiating the `NearestNeighbors` class.

Here is the minimal debugging test based on the given information:

```json
{
  "debugging_test" : "
import numpy as np
from sklearn.cluster import OPTICS

# Create some sample data
np.random.seed(0)
data = np.random.rand(50, 2)  # 50 data points in 2D

# Attempt to use OPTICS with a float 'min_samples' should trigger the issue
try:
    clust = OPTICS(metric='minkowski', n_jobs=-1, min_samples=0.1)
    clust.fit(data)
except TypeError as e:
    print('Caught expected TypeError:', e)"
}
```

This test simulates the situation described in the issue, purposefully causing the `TypeError` by running the `OPTICS.fit` method with a `min_samples` value that is a float. The objective is to ensure this exact issue can be reproduced, allowing for precise debugging and validation of any proposed fix.

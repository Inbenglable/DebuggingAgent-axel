To resolve the issue, I need to inspect the source code of the `submit_row` method in the `django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py` file. This will allow me to understand the context in which the logic is applied and integrate the necessary permission check. I will retrieve the source code of the method to ensure a precise patch.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py", "submit_row")
```

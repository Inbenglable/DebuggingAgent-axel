To resolve this issue related to adding an xfail marker dynamically, I need to examine the surrounding code that manages how xfail markers are handled once they are added, to understand the change in behavior from pytest 5.x to 6.x.

Here is the approach I will take:
1. I will inspect the `Node.add_marker` method that affects how markers are appended to tests in pytest.
2. Additionally, I will explore how the xfail marker specifically affects test outcomes post-addition and any related changes between pytest versions.

Given that I have already discovered the `add_marker` method in `src/_pytest/nodes.py`, I will proceed to understand how the xfail condition is handled. 

I will inspect the pytest repository to locate the relevant code which may include or be related to xfail handling or conditions.

Here's the API I will invoke:

```python
search_method_in_codebase("xfail")
search_method_in_file("src/_pytest/nodes.py", "add_marker")
```

To generate a patch, I need to review the source code of the `alter_index_together` method in the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class. This will help me understand its current implementation and determine how the `_delete_composed_index` method is used in practice.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.alter_index_together")
```

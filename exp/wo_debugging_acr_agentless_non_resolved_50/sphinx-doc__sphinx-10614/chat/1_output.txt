To resolve the issue with incorrect links in SVG for the inheritance diagram in Sphinx, I need to understand how the `inheritance-diagram` extension generates these links, especially in SVG format. This likely involves inspecting the part of the code responsible for generating relative paths for SVG links, which seems to differ from the PNG format.

I need to examine the related methods or classes in the `sphinx.ext.inheritance_diagram` extension, tracking how it constructs paths for these diagrams. Therefore, first I need to locate the related code and retrieve the relevant method(s) handling SVG generation and relative paths calculation. 

I'll start searching for pertinent methods involved in SVG generation and link creation for inheritance diagrams within the Sphinx codebase. The overall functionality is handled by the `sphinx.ext.inheritance_diagram` extension, so I will search within this module.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("inheritance_diagram")
```

To resolve the issue, I need to look into the `unapply_migration` method within the `MigrationExecutor` class to understand its current implementation and make necessary modifications for handling squashed migrations. Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code for this method.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/executor.py", "MigrationExecutor.unapply_migration")
```

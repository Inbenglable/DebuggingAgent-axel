I have retrieved the source code for the `TR6` and `_TR56` methods in `fu.py`. The next step is to analyze the `_TR56` method where the invalid comparison of complex numbers occurs. Specifically, the offending line is:

```python
if (rv.exp < 0) == True:
```

To fix the issue, we need to handle cases where `rv.exp` is complex. Before generating the patch, I need to ensure that `bottom_up` and `perfect_power` functions are well-defined and that changes to `_TR56` and `TR6` do not affect other parts of the code unexpectedly. 

Thus, it would be beneficial to inspect the following details:
1. The `bottom_up` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`.
2. The `perfect_power` function.

Let's retrieve the relevant source code.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/simplify/simplify.py", "bottom_up")
search_method_in_codebase("perfect_power")
```

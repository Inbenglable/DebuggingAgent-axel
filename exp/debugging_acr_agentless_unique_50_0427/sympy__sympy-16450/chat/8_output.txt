To resolve the issue, I need to examine the `posify` method's source code to understand how assumptions are currently being handled and how to modify it to preserve additional assumptions like `finite`.

Let's retrieve the source code of the `posify` method in the `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/simplify/simplify.py", "posify")
```

The current issue is caused by attempting to access Django settings before they're configured, which leads to an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception. This occurs because the `format` method checks for `settings.USE_L10N` and `settings.USE_THOUSAND_SEPARATOR` before the Django settings module has been properly initialized.

Analyzing the code, the relevant problematic lines in the `format` method are:

```python
21    use_grouping = (use_l10n or (use_l10n is None and settings.USE_L10N)) and settings.USE_THOUSAND_SEPARATOR
22    use_grouping = use_grouping or force_grouping
23    use_grouping = use_grouping and grouping != 0
```

These lines rely on the assumption that Django settings are already set up.

The method also formats very small numbers using exponential notation by default, as indicated by:

```python
30: if isinstance(number, Decimal):
31:    # Format values with more than 200 digits (an arbitrary cutoff) using
32:    # scientific notation to avoid high memory usage in {:f}'.format().
33:    _, digits, exponent = number.as_tuple()
34:    if abs(exponent) + len(digits) > 200:
35:        number = '{:e}'.format(number)
```

The arbitrary cutoff of 200 digits compels very small numbers (`Decimal('1e-200')` and smaller) to be formatted using scientific notation, which is not desired for this particular use case when `decimal_pos` is specified.

### Steps Forward
- We need to refactor the logic that deals with formatting numbers and potentially force the formatting of very small decimals as simple zero strings when `decimal_pos` is defined.
- Review the logic that determines when scientific notation should be used.
- Adjust the method to not depend on Django settings if they're not configured.

To dive deeper into the logic, especially concerning handling extremely small decimals, we'll further inspect lines concerning the formatting decision and handling decimals:

Observed scope: `django/utils/numberformat.py:29-41` 

We'll look closely at how it formats numbers based on their decimal representation and scientific notation conditions.

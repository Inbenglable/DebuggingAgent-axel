You are a bug repair agent to resolve issues and submit pull requests.
Now You need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
timesince() raises TypeError with USE_TZ=True and >1 month interval.
Description
	 
		(last modified by Sage Abdullah)
	 
As of 8d67e16493c903adc9d049141028bc0fff43f8c8, calling timesince() with a datetime object that's one month (or more) in the past and the USE_TZ setting is set to True results in the following crash:
TypeError: can't subtract offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes
Test:
...
class TimesinceTests(TestCase):
	...
	@requires_tz_support
	@override_settings(USE_TZ=True)
	def test_long_interval_with_tz(self):
		now = timezone.now()
		d = now - datetime.timedelta(days=31)
		self.assertEqual(timesince(d), "1\xa0month")
I believe this is because the pivot instantiated here: â€‹https://github.com/django/django/blob/d2310f6473593d28c14b63a72253408b568e100a/django/utils/timesince.py#L93-L100 does not take into account the datetime object's tzinfo. Adding 0, d.tzinfo arguments to the datetime.datetime call seems to fix this.
Happy to send a PR.


Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test that can trigger the bug:
import datetime
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.utils import timezone
from django.utils.timesince import timesince

# Configure Django settings
settings.configure(USE_TZ=True, INSTALLED_APPS=[])
django.setup()

# Create a timezone-aware datetime for "now"
now = timezone.now()

# Create a datetime 31 days in the past
past_date = now - datetime.timedelta(days=31)

# Wrap the call to timesince in try-except to catch TypeError
try:
    result = timesince(past_date)
    print(f"Success! Result: {result}")
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

This is the tracing and analysis history of how we tracing and locating the buggy method and the root cause:

==================================================
The provided runtime information reveals that the error occurs during the execution of the `timesince` function in the `django/utils/timesince.py` file. The function call `now - pivot` is causing a `TypeError` because one of the datetime objects is timezone-aware, while the other is timezone-naive. This occurs due to the `pivot` datetime object, which is created without timezone information, as shown by the following line in the traceback:

```python
pivot = datetime.datetime(
    pivot_year,
    pivot_month,
    min(MONTHS_DAYS[pivot_month - 1], d.day),
    d.hour,
    d.minute,
    d.second,
)
```

The absence of `tzinfo` when creating `pivot` turns it into a naive datetime object, which cannot be directly compared to the timezone-aware `datetime` object represented by `now`.

Given this information, I can locate the buggy code in the `timesince` function.

Therefore, the anomaly occurs in this specific method:

Buggy method: `django/utils/timesince.py:timesince`
==================================================


Now, you need to fix the buggy method timesince, whose method code is as follow:
    28	def timesince(d, now=None, reversed=False, time_strings=None, depth=2):
    29	    """
    30	    Take two datetime objects and return the time between d and now as a nicely
    31	    formatted string, e.g. "10 minutes". If d occurs after now, return
    32	    "0 minutes".
    33	
    34	    Units used are years, months, weeks, days, hours, and minutes.
    35	    Seconds and microseconds are ignored.
    36	
    37	    The algorithm takes into account the varying duration of years and months.
    38	    There is exactly "1 year, 1 month" between 2013/02/10 and 2014/03/10,
    39	    but also between 2007/08/10 and 2008/09/10 despite the delta being 393 days
    40	    in the former case and 397 in the latter.
    41	
    42	    Up to `depth` adjacent units will be displayed.  For example,
    43	    "2 weeks, 3 days" and "1 year, 3 months" are possible outputs, but
    44	    "2 weeks, 3 hours" and "1 year, 5 days" are not.
    45	
    46	    `time_strings` is an optional dict of strings to replace the default
    47	    TIME_STRINGS dict.
    48	
    49	    `depth` is an optional integer to control the number of adjacent time
    50	    units returned.

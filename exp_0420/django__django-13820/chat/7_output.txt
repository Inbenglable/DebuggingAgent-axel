Based on the information provided, I need to retrieve the source code of the `MigrationLoader.load_disk` method in the file `django/db/migrations/loader.py`. This method will be the target of the corrective implementation.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/loader.py", "MigrationLoader.load_disk")
```

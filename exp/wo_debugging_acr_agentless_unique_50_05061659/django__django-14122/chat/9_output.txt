To determine whether the issue is fixed, we need to review the patch and analyze the test outputs both before and after applying the patch.

### Review of the Patch:
The patch modifies the `get_group_by()` method of the `SQLCompiler` class. It introduces logic to filter out the `Meta.ordering` fields from being included in the `GROUP BY` clause. The change involves:
1. Creating a set of expressions that are derived from `Meta.ordering`.
2. Ensuring that these expressions are not included when generating the `GROUP BY` clause.

### Test Output Analysis:
- **Original Output:** The test encounters a `RuntimeError` indicating that `setup_test_environment()` was called multiple times without a corresponding call to `teardown_test_environment()`. This error occurs before the actual test logic is executed, meaning that it doesn't actually test the main issue regarding the `GROUP BY`.

- **Patched Output:** The patched output remains the same, with the same `RuntimeError` preventing the actual test from running.

### Conclusion:
The `RuntimeError` related to the testing environment setup prevents the test from executing its logic to determine whether `Meta.ordering` fields are improperly included in the `GROUP BY` clause. As a result, neither the original nor the patched test output provides any evidence related to the specific bug described in the issue.

Therefore, the current test setup does not allow us to verify if the patch fixes the original problem. The test infrastructure needs to be corrected to focus on the actual `GROUP BY` and `Meta.ordering` interaction.

Issue resolved: `False`

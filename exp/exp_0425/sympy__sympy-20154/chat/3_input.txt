<ISSUE>
partitions() reusing the output dictionaries
The partitions() iterator in sympy.utilities.iterables reuses the output dictionaries. There is a caveat about it in the docstring. 

I'm wondering if it's really that important for it to do this. It shouldn't be that much of a performance loss to copy the dictionary before yielding it. This behavior is very confusing. It means that something as simple as list(partitions()) will give an apparently wrong result. And it can lead to much more subtle bugs if the partitions are used in a nontrivial way. 

</ISSUE>


A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
The issue described relates to the `partitions` function in `sympy.utilities.iterables`. From the provided trace and test, it's observed that the function reuses the dictionaries it yields, leading to confusion where all dictionaries appear the same after consumption, as seen in the output:

- **Original list of partitions:** `[{1: 6}, {1: 6}, {1: 6}, {1: 6}]`
- **Fixed list of partitions:** `[{2: 3}, {2: 2, 1: 2}, {2: 1, 1: 4}, {1: 6}]`

The root cause is that the function yields the same dictionary multiple times without creating a deep copy, causing overwriting of the previously yielded dictionary as modifications are made for subsequent partitions.

The problematic behavior occurs in the `partitions` function defined in `sympy/utilities/iterables.py`. The function is yielding `ms` (a dictionary tracking partitions) without copying it, hence the confusion arises when modifications are subsequently made to `ms`.

Buggy method: `sympy/utilities/iterables.py:partitions`
==================================================

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
I would need to retrieve the source code of the `partitions` method in the `sympy.utilities.iterables` module to analyze its implementation and make the necessary changes. I'll proceed to search for this method's code in the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/utilities/iterables.py", "partitions")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_file("sympy/utilities/iterables.py", "partitions")
RESULT:
#### sympy/utilities/iterables.py:partitions
```python
def partitions(n, m=None, k=None, size=False):
    """Generate all partitions of positive integer, n.

    Parameters
    ==========

    m : integer (default gives partitions of all sizes)
        limits number of parts in partition (mnemonic: m, maximum parts)
    k : integer (default gives partitions number from 1 through n)
        limits the numbers that are kept in the partition (mnemonic: k, keys)
    size : bool (default False, only partition is returned)
        when ``True`` then (M, P) is returned where M is the sum of the
        multiplicities and P is the generated partition.

    Each partition is represented as a dictionary, mapping an integer
    to the number of copies of that integer in the partition.  For example,
    the first partition of 4 returned is {4: 1}, "4: one of them".

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.utilities.iterables import partitions

    The numbers appearing in the partition (the key of the returned dict)
    are limited with k:

    >>> for p in partitions(6, k=2):  # doctest: +SKIP
    ...     print(p)
    {2: 3}
    {1: 2, 2: 2}
    {1: 4, 2: 1}
    {1: 6}

    The maximum number of parts in the partition (the sum of the values in
    the returned dict) are limited with m (default value, None, gives
    partitions from 1 through n):

    >>> for p in partitions(6, m=2):  # doctest: +SKIP
    ...     print(p)
    ...
    {6: 1}
    {1: 1, 5: 1}
    {2: 1, 4: 1}
    {3: 2}

    Note that the _same_ dictionary object is returned each time.
    This is for speed:  generating each partition goes quickly,
    taking constant time, independent of n.

    >>> [p for p in partitions(6, k=2)]
    [{1: 6}, {1: 6}, {1: 6}, {1: 6}]

    If you want to build a list of the returned dictionaries then
    make a copy of them:

    >>> [p.copy() for p in partitions(6, k=2)]  # doctest: +SKIP
    [{2: 3}, {1: 2, 2: 2}, {1: 4, 2: 1}, {1: 6}]
    >>> [(M, p.copy()) for M, p in partitions(6, k=2, size=True)]  # doctest: +SKIP
    [(3, {2: 3}), (4, {1: 2, 2: 2}), (5, {1: 4, 2: 1}), (6, {1: 6})]

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

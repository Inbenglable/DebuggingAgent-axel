Change uuid field to FK does not create dependency
Description
	 
		(last modified by Simon Charette)
	 
Hi! I am new in django community, so please help me, because i really dont know is it really "bug".
I have a django project named "testproject" and two apps: testapp1, testapp2.
It will be simpler to understand, with this example:
# TestApp1(models.py):
class App1(models.Model):
	id = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, unique=True, default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False, verbose_name=_('identifier'))
	text = models.CharField(max_length=100, verbose_name=_('text'))
	another_app = models.UUIDField(null=True, blank=True, verbose_name=_('another app'))
# TestApp2(models.py):
class App2(models.Model):
	id = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, unique=True, default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False, verbose_name=_('identifier'))
	text = models.CharField(max_length=100, verbose_name=_('text'))
First model named "App1" has UUID field named "another_app":
 another_app = models.UUIDField(null=True, blank=True, verbose_name=_('another app'))
After some time i change field from UUID to FK, like this: 
another_app = models.ForeignKey(App2, null=True, blank=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, verbose_name=_('another app'))
And as result i create new migration, but Migration class was unexpected result, because it does not create any "dependencies" for App2, because of FK.
I think the correct solution will be create dependency for App2.
This project use django version 2.2 and postgresql. Attach archive with sources. Project contains small test, after running him, you will get exception like this: ValueError: Related model 'testapp2.App2' cannot be resolved.
So is it problem in django or maybe i dont understand something ?
Here is my post in django users:

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue, I need to gather more information on how Django handles dependencies in database migrations, specifically concerning ForeignKey relationships. This typically involves looking into the generated migration files as well as understanding the `ForeignKey` field and migration generation process in Django's code.

First, I will retrieve the code for the `ForeignKey` field and also look for the migration class in Django 2.2 to understand how dependencies are created or if there is a condition under which they might not be.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ForeignKey")
search_class_in_codebase("Migration")
```

These searches should help me understand how the dependencies in migrations for ForeignKey fields are handled in Django.

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

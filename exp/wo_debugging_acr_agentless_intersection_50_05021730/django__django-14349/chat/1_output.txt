To resolve the issue, I'll need to modify the `URLValidator` to incorporate handling for LF, CR, and tab characters. To do this, I need to examine the current implementation of the `URLValidator` class/method in Django's codebase. I will first search for the `URLValidator` class to understand its current validation process.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("URLValidator")
```

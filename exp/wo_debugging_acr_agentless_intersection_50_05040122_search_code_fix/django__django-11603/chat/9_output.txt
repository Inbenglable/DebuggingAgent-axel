To resolve the issue by adding DISTINCT support for the `Avg` and `Sum` aggregates in Django, I'll make modifications to these classes similar to how the `Count` class handles DISTINCT. This involves adding the `allow_distinct` attribute with a value of `True`. Below are the patches in the required format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):\n=======\nclass Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):\n=======\nclass Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

These edits will enable DISTINCT support for the `Avg` and `Sum` aggregates without affecting their existing functionality.

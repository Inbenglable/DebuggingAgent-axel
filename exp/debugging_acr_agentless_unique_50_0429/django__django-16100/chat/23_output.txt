To determine whether the issue is resolved, let's analyze the patch and outputs:

### Patch Analysis
The patch applies a change to the `changelist_view` method by wrapping database modification operations within a `transaction.atomic()` block. This should ensure that all modifications are treated as a single transaction, which gets rolled back if any part of it fails, thereby maintaining the consistency of the database.

### Test Output Analysis
- **Original Output**: The error indicates that the Django settings are not configured properly (`ImproperlyConfigured: Requested setting INSTALLED_APPS, but settings are not configured`). This error does not relate to a transaction issue; it relates to the test environment's configuration, specifically the Django settings setup.

- **Patched Output**: The error after applying the patch is identical to the original output. This suggests that the patch did not alter the behavior of the test environment, as the same configuration issue persists.

### Conclusion
The issue indicated by the `ImproperlyConfigured` error prevents the test from executing correctly. Without a proper test setup, we cannot confirm whether the transaction handling is working as intended because the error is unrelated to the transactional code changes. Therefore, even though a transactional block is added in the code, the test for verifying its function could not be executed due to a separate configuration issue.

Issue resolved: `False`

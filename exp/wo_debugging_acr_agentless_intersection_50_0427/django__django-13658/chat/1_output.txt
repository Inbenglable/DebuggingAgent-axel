To resolve the issue, we need to identify where the `ManagementUtility` class and its `__init__` method are defined and then ensure that the `CommandParser` is instantiated with the correct `prog` argument derived from the `self.prog_name`.

I need to retrieve the source code for the `ManagementUtility` class and its usage of `CommandParser` to identify where the changes need to be made.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ManagementUtility")
search_code_in_codebase("CommandParser(usage='%(prog)s subcommand [options] [args]'")
```

The issue described involves the `Paginator` class not implementing the `__iter__` method, which prevents it from being directly iterable in a `for` loop. This is confirmed by the runtime error message: `TypeError: 'MockPaginator' object is not iterable`, which indicates that Python's iteration protocol methods (`__iter__` or `__getitem__`) are missing from the `Paginator` class.

The highlighted `Paginator` class in `django/core/paginator.py` currently does not include an `__iter__` method. As per the issue description, the proposed addition to make this class iterable is:

```python
def __iter__(self):
    for page_num in self.page_range:
        yield self.page(page_num)
```

This would iterate over the pages available in `page_range` and yield each page object, effectively making `Paginator` instances iterable.

Given the analysis and the absence of `__iter__` in the `Paginator` class, I can directly identify the missing method, which needs to be added to resolve the issue.

Buggy method: `django/core/paginator.py:Paginator`

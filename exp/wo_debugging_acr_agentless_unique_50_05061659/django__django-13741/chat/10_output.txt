The patch provided modifies the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` class to introduce an `__init__` method that sets the `disabled` attribute to `True` by default. This patch correctly addresses the original Django issue, which suggested disabling the field by default to prevent accidental password changes when using `UserChangeForm`.

However, the test outputs before and after applying the patch show the same error:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'test_settings'
```

This error is related to the absence of a `test_settings` module, which seems to be the configuration settings for Django. It indicates that the testing environment is not correctly set up with the necessary Django settings module for running tests. This issue is unrelated to the patch itself.

To ensure proper verification of the patch, the test setup needs to be corrected by providing a valid Django settings module. Until then, it is impossible to confirm whether the patch resolves the intended issue fully, as the tests themselves cannot be executed successfully.

Since the testing setup issue has not been addressed, my assessment of whether the issue is resolved must be based on the patch logic rather than successful test runtimes.

Issue resolved: `True`

To resolve the issue, I need to modify how the LaTeX representation is generated for the `Subs` class. This likely involves updating a method responsible for the LaTeX conversion, which might be named something like `_latex` or similar within the `Subs` class.

Given the class definition is located in `sympy/core/function.py`, I will now search for the method responsible for LaTeX conversion within this file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/core/function.py", "Subs._latex")
```

Here's the patch to fix the issue with `combine_attrs='override'` in the `merge` functionality of the xarray project:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### xarray/core/merge.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        return variable_attrs[0]\n=======\n        return dict(variable_attrs[0])\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch ensures that the returned attributes in the "override" case are copied into a new dictionary, thus avoiding unintended side effects when modifying the merged dataset's attributes.

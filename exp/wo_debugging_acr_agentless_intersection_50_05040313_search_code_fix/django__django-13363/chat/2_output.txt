To generate the patch, I need to obtain the source code of the `as_sql` method for both `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` classes. This will help me understand how to incorporate the `tzinfo` parameter appropriately. I will now retrieve the source code for these methods.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncDate.as_sql")
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncTime.as_sql")
```

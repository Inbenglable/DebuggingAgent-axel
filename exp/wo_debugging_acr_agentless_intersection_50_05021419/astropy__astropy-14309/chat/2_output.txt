The retrieved source code for the `is_fits` function shows where the error likely occursâ€”when the `args` tuple is empty, it tries to access `args[0]`, leading to an `IndexError`.

To handle this, the code should first check if `args` has any elements before accessing it. Now, I have enough information to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

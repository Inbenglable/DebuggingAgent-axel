## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Removing a default header of a session
[The docs](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#session-objects) say that you can prevent sending a session header by setting the headers value to None in the method's arguments. You would expect (as [discussed on IRC](https://botbot.me/freenode/python-requests/msg/10788170/)) that this would work for session's default headers, too:

``` python
session = requests.Session()
# Do not send Accept-Encoding
session.headers['Accept-Encoding'] = None
```

What happens is that "None"  gets sent as the value of header.

```
Accept-Encoding: None
```

For the reference, here is a way that works:

``` python
del session.headers['Accept-Encoding']
```

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve this issue, we need to investigate how session headers are managed in the `requests` library. Specifically, we need to find where the headers are being set or modified in the `Session` class, as that's where the behavior needs to be adjusted to support setting a header value to `None`, which should prevent that header from being sent entirely.

Therefore, to understand what part of the code is responsible for handling session headers, I'll need to locate the `Session` class in the `requests` repository. Once we retrieve the source code for this class, we'll look for methods or code blocks that deal with setting or managing headers.

I'll proceed with searching for the `Session` class in the codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Session")
```

==================================================

Your Output:
To address the issue of not sending a session header when its value is set to `None`, I'll need to examine the `request` method of the `Session` class in the `requests/sessions.py` file. This is the method likely responsible for handling headers before sending a request. By understanding its current implementation, I can create a patch to skip headers with `None` values.

Let's proceed by retrieving the code for the `request` method.

search_method_in_file("requests/sessions.py", "Session.request")

==================================================

Your Output:
To resolve the issue, we need to modify the way headers are handled in the `request` method of the `Session` class. Currently, there seems to be no mechanism to skip headers with `None` values. 

To implement this, we'll need to ensure that when preparing the request, any headers with `None` values are removed before the request is sent. This will involve examining how headers are set and manipulated, particularly in the `Session.request` method and potentially the `prepare_request` method.

Since I have the code for the `request` method but need to understand how headers are processed or modified when preparing a request, specifically in the `prepare_request` method, I will retrieve the source code for the `prepare_request` method.

search_method_in_file("requests/sessions.py", "Session.prepare_request")

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

To address the issue, I need to understand how the `symbols` function works in SymPy, particularly how it handles the `cls` argument when there are additional parentheses in the input. Thus, I need to gather the source code of the `symbols` function to analyze it.

I'll start by looking for the `symbols` function within the codebase, as its direct file path isn't mentioned.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("symbols")
```

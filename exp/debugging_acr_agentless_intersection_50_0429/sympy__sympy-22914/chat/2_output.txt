Based on the information provided, we can see that the `PythonCodePrinter` does not support the `Min` and `Max` functions correctly, which is causing the test case to fail with an `AssertionError`. The code snippet in the issue suggests that their implementation is missing in `PythonCodePrinter`. 

The expected output for printing `Min(a, b)` is `min(a, b)`, but the current implementation returns in Python's conditional expression format: `'((a) if (a <= b) else (b))'`. This indicates that the printer's implementation for `Min` function is not aligning with the expected output as per the printer's logic.

The abnormal behavior was apparent when attempting to print Python code for the `Min` function through the `pycode` function, which internally uses the `PythonCodePrinter` to convert sympy expressions to Python code.

Since the issue suggests adding or modifying methods `_print_Min` and `_print_Max` inside the `PythonCodePrinter` class, we should locate where this printer's method or functionality resides inside the repository. The next logical step is to check how `pycode` uses `PythonCodePrinter` and how it processes the `Min` function.

Observed method: `sympy/printing/pycode.py:pycode`

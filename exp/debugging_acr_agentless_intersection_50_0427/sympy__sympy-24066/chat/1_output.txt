The issue lies in how the function `_collect_factor_and_dimension()` in the `UnitSystem` is handling the dimension detection for the exponential function. From the traceback, we see that the `expr` variable equals `second/(farad*ohm)`. When computing the dimensions of `exp(second/(farad*ohm))`, the current implementation erroneously returns `Dimension(time/(capacitance*impedance))` instead of `Dimension(1)`.

This suggests the bug lies in how the system is handling dimensionless quantities. Specifically, the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method should correctly recognize that the result of an exponential function of a dimensionless quantity is also dimensionless.

Given this context, let's start by focusing on how `_collect_factor_and_dimension` deals with the computation of dimensions, particularly for exponential (potentially dimensionless) expressions.

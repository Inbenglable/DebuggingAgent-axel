Now You need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Migration import ordering violates coding style and isort defaults
Description
	
New migration files are generated with imports sorted by module, independent of import style. For example:
import datetime
from django.db import migrations, models
import time
The ​Django coding style specifies:
Place all import module statements before from module import objects in each section.
This guidance is the same as what isort does by default, ​as documented here. Newly generated migrations can fail isort for this reason.
This would mean migration files should instead be generated like this:
import datetime
import time
from django.db import migrations, models
For reference, previous issues related to migration import sorting: #24155, #25384.

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue described, we need to modify the code that generates migration files to ensure that imports are ordered according to Django's coding style and isort's defaults. This likely involves updating the code responsible for creating those migration files. 

To proceed, I need to find and inspect the source code that handles migration file creation, specifically focusing on the ordering of import statements. Typically, this code would be part of Django's migration system, possibly within a migration generator or writer module.

Let's start by searching for the relevant class or method responsible for generating migration files in the Django codebase.

```python
search_code_in_codebase("import datetime\nfrom django.db import migrations, models\n")
search_class_in_codebase("MigrationWriter")
search_method_in_codebase("write_migration_file")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_class_in_codebase("MigrationWriter")
RESULT:
#### django/db/migrations/writer.py:MigrationWriter
```python
class MigrationWriter:
    """
    Take a Migration instance and is able to produce the contents
    of the migration file from it.
    """

    def __init__(self, migration, include_header=True):
        ...

    def as_string(self):
        ...

    @property
    def basedir(self):
        ...

    @property
    def filename(self):
        ...

    @property
    def path(self):
        ...

    @classmethod
    def serialize(cls, value):
        ...

    @classmethod
    def register_serializer(cls, type_, serializer):
        ...

    @classmethod
    def unregister_serializer(cls, type_):
        ...
```


==================================================

Your Output:
To resolve the issue, I need to inspect the source code of the `MigrationWriter` class, specifically its `as_string` method, which is likely responsible for formatting the generated migration files, including import statements. This will provide more details on how imports are currently organized and how modifications can be applied to enforce import ordering as per Django's coding style.

I will retrieve the `as_string` method from the `MigrationWriter` class in the `django/db/migrations/writer.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/writer.py", "MigrationWriter.as_string")
```

Your Output:
Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

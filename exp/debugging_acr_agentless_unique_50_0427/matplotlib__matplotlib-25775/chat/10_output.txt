To address the issue, I will need to:

1. Add `set_antialiased` and `get_antialiased` methods to the `Text` class in `lib/matplotlib/text.py`.
2. Update the `RendererAgg.draw_text` method in `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_agg.py` to check and use the antialiasing property from the `Text` object instead of the global `rcParams` setting.

I have already retrieved the necessary source code for the `Text` class and the `RendererAgg.draw_text` method. Therefore, I am ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

### Analysis of Current Observed Code

The provided code snippet (lines 950 to 970 in `defaulttags.py`) is part of the Django template tag parsing logic, specifically handling the `ifchanged` tag. It shows how tokens are split and parsed into true and false node lists which are then used to render conditional content changes within templates.

### Abnormal Program Behavior

The primary abnormal behavior noted during testing is a `TemplateSyntaxError` due to the non-existence of a registered `json_script` template tag. This suggests a missing registration or implementation and is unrelated to the functionality or parsing of the `ifchanged` tags, which were observed in the current scope.

Separate from this template processing, an `AssertionError` related to file path checks (`os.path.exists(file_path)`) in the debugging environment interrupts the execution trace. While not affecting Django template tag behavior, this debugging setup issue could hinder further insights into the normal runtime environment.

### Analysis Conclusion

The observed code snippet pertained to the `ifchanged` tag logic and does not seem directly related to the `json_script` template tag registration or usage. Therefore, the observed scope does not provide clues toward resolving the primary issue with `json_script`.

### Next Steps

To resolve the primary issue, the focus must shift to areas within Django's template system where the template tags, such as `json_script`, should be defined or registered. This includes:

- **Locating the definition** of `json_script` within existing Django libraries or codebase sections.
- **Identifying the registration** process for template libraries to ensure `json_script` can be properly loaded.

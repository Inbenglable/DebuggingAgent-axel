Based on the tracing data provided, we can observe the following:
1. The issue arises when handling expressions involving exponential functions with dimensionless arguments.
2. The function `_collect_factor_and_dimension()` is called with `expr` set to `exp(second/(farad*ohm))`.
3. Inside `_collect_factor_and_dimension()`, there's a block that checks if `expr` is an instance of `Function` (lines 192-196). Here, `_collect_factor_and_dimension` is recursively called for each argument of the function. The function collects the factor and dimension for the arguments but does not adequately handle the case for when the exponential expression should be dimensionless.
4. The recursive call on the arguments returns the dimension `Dimension(time/(capacitance*impedance))`, which is not correctly inferred as dimensionless, leading to a `ValueError`.

Given the observed block and flow, the indication is that the problem likely originates from the handling of `Function` types within `_collect_factor_and_dimension()` where it fails to recognize dimensionless results for special functions like `exp` when their arguments are dimensionless.

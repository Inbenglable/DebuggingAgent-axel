The provided error message and the context indicate that the function `combine_by_coords` is raising a `ValueError` when the coordinates of the dimension `y` are non-monotonic even if they are identical. According to the issue, the expectation is that the `combine_by_coords` function should not raise an error when non-varying coordinate dimensions are identical, irrespective of their order.

### Analyzing the issue:

1. **Current Observation**: The error occurs when `combine_by_coords` attempts to combine datasets `ds1` and `ds2` with non-monotonic `y` coordinates.

2. **Expectation**: The function is expected to ignore identical but non-monotonic coordinates when they don't vary across datasets.

3. **Root Cause Identification**: The error occurs because the function `combine_by_coords` currently includes a check for monotonicity on coordinate dimensions, even when they do not vary between datasets.

The task requires examining the internal workings of the `combine_by_coords` function, or connected functionality, such as the code related to the validation of dataset coordinates, to understand why the function is enforcing monotonicity.

### Next Step:

To diagnose the behavior, we need to trace into the `combine_by_coords` function to observe how it is currently processing the dataset coordinates.

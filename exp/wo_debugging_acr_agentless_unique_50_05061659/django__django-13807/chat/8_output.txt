To determine if the issue is resolved, I need to assess the provided details:

1. **Patch Context**:
   - The patch introduces changes in the SQL statements within the `check_constraints` method by adding backticks around table names. This should address the root cause of the crash due to SQL keywords being unquoted.

2. **Original Output**:
   - Initially, there was a failure during the test setup due to missing the module `test_app`.

3. **Patch Output**:
   - The error remains the same after applying the patch, indicating there's no change in behavior, meaning the application couldn't reach the point of executing the `check_constraints` method because `test_app` is missing.

Given this analysis, the problem is not with the SQL syntax, but with setting up the Django test environment properly due to the absence of the `test_app` module. Until this issue is resolved, the effectiveness of the patch cannot be successfully tested.

Issue resolved: `False`

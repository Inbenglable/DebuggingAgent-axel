To resolve the issue, we need to examine the `_pytest.capture.EncodedFile` class, specifically its initialization and how it sets the `mode`. We will need the class code to determine how to adjust the mode attribute to avoid including `b`.

Let's proceed to retrieve the source code for the `_pytest.capture.EncodedFile` class using the search APIs.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("_pytest.capture.EncodedFile")
```

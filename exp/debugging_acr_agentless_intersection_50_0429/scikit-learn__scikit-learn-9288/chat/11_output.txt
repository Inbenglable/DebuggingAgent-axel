The patch attempted to address the issue by ensuring consistent random seed generation and random state checking. The main goal was to make the results of KMeans clustering identical regardless of the number of parallel jobs specified (`n_jobs`). 

Upon reviewing the test outputs before and after the patch:

- **Original Output Before Patch:** The inertia values between `n_jobs=1` and `n_jobs=2` were slightly different, leading to an `AssertionError`.
- **Output After Patch:** The same `AssertionError` persists, indicating that the inertia values remain different even after applying the patch.

Since the output indicates that the discrepancy remains unresolved, the patch did not successfully fix the issue.

Issue resolved: `False`

To resolve the issue and enable support for the `distinct` option in Django's `Avg` and `Sum` aggregates, we first need to address the problem of the application registry not being ready when attempting to define models and perform database operations. The error `AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet.` highlights this problem.

### Analysis of Current Code and Abnormal Behavior

1. **Initialization Issue**:
   - The script attempts to define a Django model (`TestModel`) and perform various operations before the Django application registry is fully initialized.
   - It directly defines the model class immediately after configuring settings but does not ensure that the Django app setup is complete.

2. **Missing Setup Call**:
   - The Django framework requires the `django.setup()` call to fully initialize the application registry, prepare the models, and be ready to perform any model-related operations.
   - The absence of this call is causing the app registry to be in a non-ready state. This results in the `AppRegistryNotReady` exception.

3. **Script Setup Sequence**:
   - Immediate use of models or operations before registry initialization is causing this script to fail when checking for the readiness of app configurations.

### Bug Identification
The current test setup fails due to the improper order of initializing Django components. The bug is not in the handling of aggregates as defined in the issue yet but is an issue with script configuration and setup.

### Next Steps for Issue Resolution
- Ensure correct initialization sequence by inserting `django.setup()` before any models or database operations are performed in the script.
- Once we have resolved the setup issue and the test can proceed, we can then focus on extending `distinct` support to `Avg` and `Sum` aggregates.

### Continued Tracing
To address this, we need to ensure proper initialization and call `django.setup()` early in the script. I'll continue tracing to find where this should happen in the execution sequence. Here is the next step:

Observed method: `django/__init__.py:setup`

To address the issue of exposing `warm_start` in the `IsolationForest` class, I need to retrieve the source code for `IsolationForest` and potentially the methods associated with its initialization and fitting processes to confirm where the `warm_start` parameter can be added and how the documentation and test can be adjusted appropriately.

I'll search for the `IsolationForest` class and its `__init__` method in the codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("IsolationForest")
search_method_in_codebase("IsolationForest.__init__")
```

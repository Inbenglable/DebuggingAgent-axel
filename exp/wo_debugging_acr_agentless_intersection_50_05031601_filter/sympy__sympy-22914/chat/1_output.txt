To resolve the issue, I need to add the `_print_Min` and `_print_Max` methods to the `PythonCodePrinter` class in the SymPy project. However, before generating the patch, I need to gather the source code for the `PythonCodePrinter` class to understand where and how to integrate these methods.

Let's search for the `PythonCodePrinter` class in the codebase to locate its source file.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("PythonCodePrinter")
```

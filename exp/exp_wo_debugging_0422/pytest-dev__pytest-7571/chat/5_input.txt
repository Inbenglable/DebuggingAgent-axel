#### ISSUE
caplog fixture doesn't restore log level after test
From the documentation at https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.0.0/logging.html#caplog-fixture, "The log levels set are restored automatically at the end of the test".
It used to work, but looks broken in new 6.0 release. Minimal example to reproduce:

```
def test_foo(caplog):
    caplog.set_level(42)

def test_bar(caplog):
    print(caplog.handler.level)
```

It prints "0" for pytest<6, "42" after.

==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue related to the `caplog` fixture not restoring the log level, I need to examine how the `caplog` fixture is implemented, particularly focusing on any methods related to setting and restoring log levels. Since I don't have the file path for where the `caplog` fixture is likely implemented, I need to search for this code in the codebase.

I'll start by searching for the `caplog` fixture which could be implemented as a function or part of a class. I'll look for the class or method likely responsible for handling the log level changes within the `caplog` fixture.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("caplog")
search_class_in_codebase("caplog")
```

==================================================

Your Output:
To resolve the issue, I need to examine the implementation details of the `LogCaptureFixture` class, which seems to be responsible for managing log capture in the `caplog` fixture. I need to investigate how it handles setting and restoring log levels. More specifically, I should look for methods in `LogCaptureFixture` related to setting and restoring log levels.

To begin with, I will search for the `LogCaptureFixture` class in the codebase to review its source code and understand its behavior regarding log level management.

```python
search_class_in_file("src/_pytest/logging.py", "LogCaptureFixture")

        logger_obj = logging.getLogger(logger)
        orig_level = logger_obj.level

        finally:
            logger_obj.setLevel(orig_level)
            self.handler.setLevel(handler_orig_level)
```


==================================================

Your Output:
Based on the information retrieved so far, the `LogCaptureFixture` class has an `at_level` context manager method which appears to handle the temporary setting of the log level and ensures it's restored afterwards. However, the issue seems to be that the log level isn't being properly restored outside this context manager.

The `set_level` method, which is meant to set the log level, might not be accompanied by a corresponding mechanism to restore the original log level when it's called directly (not within `at_level`). Resolving this issue might involve ensuring that `set_level` itself has a mechanism to record and restore the original log level, similar to `at_level`.

I'll check the `set_level` method implementation in detail to understand its current behavior and decide on the necessary patch.

search_method_in_file("src/_pytest/logging.py", "LogCaptureFixture.set_level")

        logger_obj = logging.getLogger(logger)
        # save the original log-level to restore it during teardown
        self._initial_logger_levels.setdefault(logger, logger_obj.level)
        logger_obj.setLevel(level)
        self.handler.setLevel(level)

```


==================================================

Your Output:
The `set_level` method in the `LogCaptureFixture` class already saves the original logger levels to a dictionary named `_initial_logger_levels`, indicating that the restoration of the log level should occur at the end of the test. However, this restoration might not actually be implemented in the `_finalize` method, leading to the issue at hand. 

To confirm this and see how the restoration should be implemented (if necessary), I should retrieve the source code of the `_finalize` method to examine its contents and ensure it contains the logic to restore original log levels. I should also retrieve fields to ensure `_initial_logger_levels` is declared and set up. 

```python
search_method_in_file("src/_pytest/logging.py", "LogCaptureFixture._finalize")
search_code_in_file("src/_pytest/logging.py", "_initial_logger_levels")

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

### IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

### IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

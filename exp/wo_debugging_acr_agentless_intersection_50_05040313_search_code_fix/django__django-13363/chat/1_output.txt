To resolve the issue, I need to review the source code related to the problematic line and understand how the `tzinfo` parameter should work.

I will start by retrieving the source code of the `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` classes in the file `django/db/models/functions/datetime.py` to determine how the `tzinfo` parameter is currently being handled.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncDate")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncTime")
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "get_current_timezone_name")
search_code_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "get_current_timezone_name()")
```

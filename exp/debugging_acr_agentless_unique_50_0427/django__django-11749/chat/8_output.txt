To generate a patch for the issue, I need to access the source code of the `call_command` method within the `django/core/management/__init__.py` file. This method is responsible for executing Django management commands and currently doesn't handle mutually exclusive argument groups correctly. I'll retrieve the source code for `call_command` to understand its structure and implement the necessary fix.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/management/__init__.py", "call_command")
```

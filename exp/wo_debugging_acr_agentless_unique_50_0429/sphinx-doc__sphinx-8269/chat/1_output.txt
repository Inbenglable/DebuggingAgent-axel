To resolve this issue, I need to understand how the `linkcheck` feature is implemented in the Sphinx project, particularly the part that handles the checking of anchors and status codes. Therefore, I need to search for relevant methods or classes in the codebase.

First, I will search for any method related to `linkcheck` or anchor checking to get the relevant code that handles this feature.

Since the issue is related to `linkcheck_anchors=True`, it makes sense to start by retrieving functions or classes that directly relate to link checking with the anchor functionality. Iâ€™ll search with relevant keywords to narrow down the code.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("linkcheck")
```

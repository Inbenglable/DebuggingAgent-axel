To add DISTINCT support to the Avg and Sum aggregates in Django, I need to modify the corresponding class definitions by allowing DISTINCT as a parameter. For that, I should examine the source code of these classes to see how they could be adjusted for this change.

I will retrieve the source code for the Avg and Sum classes to make those adjustments.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Avg")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Sum")
```

To generate a patch for this issue, I need to examine the source code of the `add_fields` method in the `django/forms/formsets.py` file. I'll need to retrieve this method's source code to understand its context and ensure that the proposed fix is correctly applied.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/forms/formsets.py", "add_fields")
```

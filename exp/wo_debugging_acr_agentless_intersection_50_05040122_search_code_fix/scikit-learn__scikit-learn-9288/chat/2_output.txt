I have identified that the issue lies in the KMeans class, particularly in how the `n_jobs` parameter is handled during the fitting process. The `fit` method calls the `k_means` function, passing along the `n_jobs` parameter. To address the issue, I need to examine the `k_means` function to understand how it deals with parallel computation.

It's important to understand the internals of the `k_means` function, but the code snippet I retrieved earlier does not provide the source code of the `k_means` function. We need to search for the `k_means` function to analyze its implementation.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("k_means")
```

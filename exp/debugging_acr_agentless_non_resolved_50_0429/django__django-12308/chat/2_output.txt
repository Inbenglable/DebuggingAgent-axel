The traceback indicates that we're encountering an `AppRegistryNotReady` exception when attempting to retrieve app configuration using `apps.get_containing_app_config(module)` in the `ModelBase.__new__` method. This error typically occurs when Django's app registry is not properly initialized.

In a standard Django application, the app registry is set up automatically during startup, typically through management commands such as `runserver` or `migrate`. However, in the provided test setup, Django settings are configured manually, and this direct call to `apps.get_containing_app_config(module)` happens before the application registry is ready, leading to the exception.

The error suggests that the apps aren't considered "ready" at the point where we attempt to define the `TestModel`. This is often due to not having run the setup phase that defines applications within the framework. Normally, the fix would be to ensure that the Django app registry is properly initialized before accessing models.

Hence the likely buggy method is where the app setup logic should be called before accessing model classes.

Buggy method: `django/apps/registry.py:Apps.get_containing_app_config`

Next, to fix this error, we'll need to make sure the Django application setup is complete before accessing any model definitions, possibly adapting the test setup to more accurately mimic normal Django initialization processes. 

However, if we do not have privilege to directly edit Django's code, the fix would involve adjusting the test script to properly load the application configuration before defining models.

To resolve the issue, I need to examine the `execute` method within the `ManagementUtility` class, as the instantiation of the `CommandParser` is likely within this method. However, I currently do not have the source code for this method.

I will retrieve the source code for the `execute` method from the `ManagementUtility` class in the `django/core/management/__init__.py` file to make the necessary adjustments.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/management/__init__.py", "ManagementUtility.execute")
```

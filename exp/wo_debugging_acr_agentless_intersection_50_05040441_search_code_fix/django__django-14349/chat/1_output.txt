To address the issue with the URLValidator tests failing due to changes in Python's URL splitting behavior, it's crucial to investigate the source code of the `URLValidator` and its associated test in the Django project. This will allow us to understand how the validation is implemented and where the adjustments need to be made.

Given that we need to analyze the specific implementation details of the `URLValidator`, we should find its source code and the associated test method where the problem has been reported.

Let's retrieve the necessary source code using the available APIs:

```python
search_method_in_codebase("URLValidator")
search_method_in_codebase("TestValidators.test_validators")
```

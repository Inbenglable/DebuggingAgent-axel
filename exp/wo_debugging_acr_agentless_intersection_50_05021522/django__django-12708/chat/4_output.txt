To generate a patch for this issue, I need to gather more context on how constraints are managed around the `_delete_composed_index` method and possibly inspect methods like `_constraint_names`, which assists in identifying constraints that need to be deleted. This method is crucial for understanding why multiple constraints are being identified. So, I'll begin by retrieving the source code for `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor._constraint_names` method. Once I have this, I'll be able to generate the necessary patch with comprehensive understanding.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor._constraint_names")
```

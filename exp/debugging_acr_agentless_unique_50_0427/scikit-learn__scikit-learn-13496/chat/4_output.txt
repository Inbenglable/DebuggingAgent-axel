Based on the provided trace and the observed code snippet, it seems that the `IsolationForest.__init__` method does not explicitly expose the `warm_start` parameter. The `warm_start` parameter is managed by the parent class `BaseBagging`, but since it is not explicitly included in the `IsolationForest` constructor, users are unable to set it directly when initializing an `IsolationForest` instance.

### Analysis of the Issue
1. **Trace Analysis:** The failure occurs because the `warm_start` parameter is not included in the `__init__` method of `IsolationForest`, causing `set_params` to throw an error when `warm_start` is set.

2. **Constructor Observation:** The constructor of `IsolationForest` initializes the base estimator and passes a number of parameters to the superclass but does not include `warm_start`. This omission results in the inability to directly initialize `IsolationForest` instances with `warm_start` set to `True`.

3. **Required Action:** To fix this, the `warm_start` parameter needs to be added explicitly to the `IsolationForest.__init__` method and subsequently passed to the `super().__init__()` call.

Given this analysis, we can identify the root cause as the lack of explicit inclusion of `warm_start` in the `IsolationForest` constructor.

### Conclusion:
- **Buggy Method:** `sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py:IsolationForest.__init__`

By integrating `warm_start` explicitly into the `__init__` method, this issue should be resolved, allowing users to set the parameter directly while initializing `IsolationForest`.

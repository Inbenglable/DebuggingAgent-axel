Given the source code retrieved for the `TypeSerializer.serialize` method, it is evident that the special case for `models.Model` is lacking the necessary import statement. This needs to be modified in order to include `"from django.db import models"` in the generated migration file.

With the information provided, I have sufficient details to generate the patch to correct the missing import for `models.Model`. No further source code retrieval is necessary.

Ready generation: `True`

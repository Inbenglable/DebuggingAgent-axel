Based on the gathered information, I need to focus on the `MigrationWriter` class as it is responsible for producing the contents of migration files. Specifically, I am interested in the `as_string` method, as it likely controls the output format of the migration files, including the import statements.

Let's retrieve the `as_string` method's source code from the `django/db/migrations/writer.py` file to understand how the import ordering is implemented.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/writer.py", "MigrationWriter.as_string")
```

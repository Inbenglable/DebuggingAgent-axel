To generate the patch for the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass to handle properties, I've reviewed the `__init__` method, which currently checks for functions using `inspect.isfunction`. Since properties are not considered functions by this check, we need to extend the logic to include checks for properties using `inspect.isdatadescriptor`. I have enough information to proceed with generating the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

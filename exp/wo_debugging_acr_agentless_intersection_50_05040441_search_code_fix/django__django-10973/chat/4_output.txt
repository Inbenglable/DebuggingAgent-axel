I need to retrieve the source code for the `DatabaseClient` class or any method in it that handles subprocess calls to update it with `subprocess.run` and set `PGPASSWORD`. Since `DatabaseClient` is imported in `tests/dbshell/test_postgresql.py`, it's likely defined somewhere within `django.db.backends.postgresql.client`. I'll search for this class in the relevant file.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py", "DatabaseClient")
```

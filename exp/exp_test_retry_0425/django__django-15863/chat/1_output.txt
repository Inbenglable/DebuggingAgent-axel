Based on the provided information and the issue description, `floatformat` template filter is suspected to have a bug where precision is lost when it processes `Decimal` numbers. The precision loss seems to stem from converting `Decimal` values to `float`, which inherently cannot maintain high precision.

From the traceback, we see the sequence of function calls starting with the initialization of `Context` and `Template`, leading to the `render` method, where the `floatformat` filter is applied.

To locate the bug, I need to examine the implementation of the `floatformat` template filter, specifically checking where and how it processes `Decimal` objects. It's likely that the faulty conversion happens here.

To proceed, I will trace into the method that handles `floatformat` logic. Based on Django's structure, this is likely located in the template backends.

Observed method: `django.template.defaultfilters:floatformat`

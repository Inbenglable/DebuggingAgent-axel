Analyzing the current observed code and abnormal program behavior reveals that the issue arises during the argument parsing process within the `_parse_command_line_configuration` method. The traceback indicates that the problem occurs when handling the short option `-v`. The runtime indicates that the `argparse.ArgumentError` is raised due to this option expecting an argument, contrary to expected behavior.

In this context, the code handling the argument parsing seems responsible for incorrectly specifying that `-v` requires an argument. This is likely defined elsewhere in the argparse setup process, which is part of the argument manager class.

To trace the set-up of argument parsing, particularly focusing on the specification of the `verbose` option, I will need to observe further upstream where the argparse object, `self._arg_parser`, has this behavior defined or modified.

Observed scope: `pylint/config/arguments_manager.py:257-259`

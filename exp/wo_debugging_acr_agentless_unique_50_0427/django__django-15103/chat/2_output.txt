To determine which retrieved code contents are relevant to addressing the issue of making the `element_id` argument of the `json_script` function optional, let's evaluate the provided code snippets:

1. **django/template/defaultfilters.py:json_script**
   - This snippet shows a `json_script` function that essentially calls another function `_json_script(value, element_id)`. It does not provide the actual implementation of how `json_script` handles its arguments or how the `element_id` is used or required.

2. **django/utils/html.py:json_script**
   - This snippet contains the actual implementation code for the `json_script` function. It shows how `element_id` is used inside the function to create a script tag with an `id` attribute. This is the part where we can make the `element_id` optional by modifying the way the `id` attribute is handled.

Given that we need to modify the function to make the `element_id` optional, the relevant code snippet that needs to be addressed is the one containing the actual implementation of the method:

```
django/utils/html.py:json_script
```

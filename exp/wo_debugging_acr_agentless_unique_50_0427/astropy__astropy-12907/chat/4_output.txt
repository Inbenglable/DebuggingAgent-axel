To resolve the issue at hand, I need to understand how the `_operators` dictionary in the `_separable` method handles nested compound models. Specifically, I need to examine how the operators like '&' are applied to obtain the separability matrix.

I'll search for the `_operators` definition in the `separable.py` file, as it is referenced in `_separable`.

```python
search_code_in_file("astropy/modeling/separable.py", "_operators")
```

Here are the necessary patches in *SEARCH/REPLACE* format to resolve the issue described:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/auth/backends.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if username is None:\n=======\
        if username is None or password is None:  # Early return if username or password is None\n        return\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/contrib/auth/backends.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
        try:\n=======\
        if username is None:\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

These patches ensure that the `authenticate` method in the `ModelBackend` class returns early when `username` or `password` is `None`, preventing unnecessary database queries and password hashing. The code maintains the original functionality while addressing the mentioned issue.

To address the issue, I need to examine the source code of the `GaussianMixture` class and specifically the `fit_predict` and `predict` methods to understand the discrepancy when `n_init > 1`. 

I will search for the `GaussianMixture` class and these methods in the scikit-learn codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("GaussianMixture")
search_method_in_codebase("GaussianMixture.fit_predict")
search_method_in_codebase("GaussianMixture.predict")
```

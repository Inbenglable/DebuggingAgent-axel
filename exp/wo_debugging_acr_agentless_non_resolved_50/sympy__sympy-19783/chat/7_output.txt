To fix the issue of the `Dagger(A) * Identity` not simplifying to `Dagger(A)` correctly, we need to adjust the multiplication behavior in the `IdentityOperator.__mul__` method to specifically check for the `Dagger` type and handle it appropriately.

Here's the patch to address this:

```pythony
### sympy/physics/quantum/operator.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if isinstance(other, Operator):
=======
        if isinstance(other, Operator) or isinstance(other, Dagger):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, I will present the changes in JSON format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/physics/quantum/operator.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if isinstance(other, Operator):\n=======\n        if isinstance(other, Operator) or isinstance(other, Dagger):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

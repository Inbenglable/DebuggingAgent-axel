I haven't retrieved the complete source code of the `runshell_db` method, which is likely where the subprocess for the PostgreSQL client is being invoked. To proceed, I need to examine that method.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py", "DatabaseClient.runshell_db")
```

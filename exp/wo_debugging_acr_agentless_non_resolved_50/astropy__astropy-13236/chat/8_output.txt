Given the context provided by the code snippets, I can determine the required modifications to implement a `FutureWarning`. This warning will notify users about the impending change where structured `np.array` data will eventually be handled as `Column` instead of being automatically transformed into an `NdarrayMixin`. I have enough context to generate the required patch for the issue.

Ready generation: `True`

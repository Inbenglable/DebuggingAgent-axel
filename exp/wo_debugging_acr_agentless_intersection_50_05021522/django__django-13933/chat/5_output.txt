I have gathered the necessary source code to address the issue with `ModelChoiceField` not displaying the invalid choice value in its validation error messages. The `Field.validate` method includes the mechanism to raise a `ValidationError` with the `invalid_choice` error message along with the parameters necessary to include the invalid value.

The next step is to modify the `ModelChoiceField` class to include the `%(value)s` parameter in the `invalid_choice` error message and make sure this value is passed properly when the `ValidationError` is raised.

Ready generation: `True`

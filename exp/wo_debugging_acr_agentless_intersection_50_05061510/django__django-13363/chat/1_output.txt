To resolve the issue described, I need to take the following steps:

1. Retrieve and examine the `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` methods in the `datetime.py` file to verify how the `tzinfo` parameter is currently being handled.
2. Investigate the `get_current_timezone_name()` method implementation, as it is specified that it is used unconditionally.
3. Review the `TimeZone` mixin used in `TruncBase` to understand its intended behavior with regard to timezone handling.

Let's start by retrieving the source code for `TruncDate`, `TruncTime`, and `get_current_timezone_name()` from the specified file path.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncBase.TruncDate")
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncBase.TruncTime")
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "get_current_timezone_name")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TimeZone")
```

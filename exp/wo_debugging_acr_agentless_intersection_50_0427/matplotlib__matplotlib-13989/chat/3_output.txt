Based on the analysis of the `Axes.hist` method, it seems that the bug arises because the `range` parameter is not appropriately used when calculating the bin edges within the `np.histogram` calls, especially when the `density=True` condition is applied. The code handles several potential pathways for `range` and `density`, accompanied by checks for normalized data. However, when it comes to setting up the histogram bins, it might not completely apply the specified `range` values under the density condition, leading to the observed discrepancy.

I have gathered enough information to work on adjusting how the `range` is accounted for during the histogram computation process. I believe additional validation or modification in `histogram_bin_edges` computation within the `Axes.hist()` method can remedy this issue.

Thus, I'm prepared to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

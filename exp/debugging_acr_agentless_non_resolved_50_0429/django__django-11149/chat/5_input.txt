Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Admin inlines for auto-created ManyToManyFields are editable if the user only has the view permission
Description
	
From https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/8060#comment:34
Replying to Will Gordon:
This seems to have regressed in (at least) 2.1. I have 2 view only permissions. I have a ManyToManyField represented in my main model as a TabularInline. But, my user with view only permissions can now add or remove these items at will!
I am having the same issue, so I assume this is a bug. I did not find Will had created a separate ticket.
models.py:
class Photo(models.Model):
	pass
class Report(models.Model):
	photos = models.ManyToManyField(Photo)
admin.py:
		class ReportPhotoInlineModelAdmin(admin.TabularInline):
			model = Report.photos.through
			show_change_link = True

This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
The issue here is that the test script is encountering an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception due to attempting to access Django settings before they are properly configured. Specifically, the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting is requested, but the framework is not fully set up due to missing configurations.

Examining the test script:
1. The script begins by importing several Django modules and configuring settings with `settings.configure`.
2. However, the error indicates that `settings.configure()` is not correctly being applied before accessing Django functionalities that require these settings, such as importing models from `django.contrib.auth`.

The immediate problem is happening because the `settings.configure()` command cannot be used to fully simulate a Django environment, especially when using Django's app registry. Proper Django initialization requires setting an environment variable or using a settings module that Django's `manage.py` script would typically handle.

In order to resolve this, I need to ensure that Django is initialized properly in the testing environment. This involves ensuring that apps are ready when models are accessed.

Based on the traceback, since the code encountered the error at:
```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User, Permission
```

The test setup should ensure Django apps are ready before reaching this import. However, since the setup seems incorrect, let's focus on the proper initialization.

Observed method: `django/conf/__init__.py:_setup`
==================================================
The traceback indicates that the program encountered an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception due to the Django settings module not being configured properly. The specific issue occurs when the script attempts to access `INSTALLED_APPS` early in the execution process, particularly when models from `django.contrib.auth` are being imported, which triggers Django's app registry setup. This setup requires the settings module to be configured.

When tracing the call to `LazySettings._setup`, we see that the environment variable `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is not set, and `settings.configure()` seems ineffective in this context because the test setup is not correctly initializing the Django environment to allow for app configurations to be accessed safely.

From this analysis, the problem seems rooted in the initialization phase of the script where the Django environment is inadequately set up, indicated by failed access to `django.contrib.auth.models` due to `INSTALLED_APPS` being required beforehand.

To pinpoint the exact code location, I will need to further inspect how Django's settings are being interacted with before reaching the point of inadequate setup. Given this examination, the focus should be on how and where setup should ensure the settings are fully prepared before further access.

Therefore, my next step is to inspect how settings are managed before imports and ensure configurations are handled effectively in the function that attempts these imports.

Observed scope: `django/conf/__init__.py:49-62`
==================================================
Analyzing the current observations and abnormal program behavior, the root cause appears to be related to improper configuration of Django settings before accessing certain functionalities that depend on these settings. Specifically, the error occurs when attempting to access "`INSTALLED_APPS`" as part of the Django imports, triggering the `LazySettings._setup` method. The traceback and runtime details indicate that the environment variable `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is not set, causing the settings to remain unconfigured.

The abnormal behavior points out that the `settings.configure()` call is not sufficient in this context, because it seems to be executed after attempts to access settings-related functionality that require proper initialization, likely indicated by the failing import of `django.contrib.auth.models`.

To fix this, there should be an initial setup that either properly defines the required environment variable or ensures that the settings are configured at a point in execution that precedes the dependent import statements.

Thus, we need to ensure the Django settings are fundamentally configured before any imports that require them are executed, particularly concerning the app registry setup.

Since current tracing points toward the necessity of proper sequence in defining the settings environment before the test execution proceeds, and considering the `LazySettings._setup` method is central to the initialization check, a logical next step is to further inspect the process that leads up to the configuration access, ensuring proper setup is respected.

Since we've reached a method that highlights an initialization issue, I will proceed with observing the process leading up to this improper setting access to locate where configuration guarantees are bypassed:

Observed method: `django/conf/__init__.py:LazySettings.__getattr__`
==================================================


Now you choose downstream method LazySettings.__getattr__ to further observe, tracing the abnormal program behavior.
This is the method code:
    73	    def __getattr__(self, name):
    74	        """Return the value of a setting and cache it in self.__dict__."""
    75	        if self._wrapped is empty:
    76	            self._setup(name)
    77	        val = getattr(self._wrapped, name)
    78	        self.__dict__[name] = val
    79	        return val


This is the runtime information of LazySettings.__getattr__:

Error occurred during script execution:Requested setting INSTALLED_APPS, but settings are not configured. You must either define the environment variable DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE or call settings.configure() before accessing settings.

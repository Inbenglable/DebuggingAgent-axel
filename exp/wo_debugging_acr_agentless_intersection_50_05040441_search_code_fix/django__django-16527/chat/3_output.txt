To address the issue with "show_save_as_new" in the Django admin, we need to adjust the permission logic in the relevant file. We'll add the `has_add_permission` check to the existing logic in the `admin_modify.py` file as indicated by the user.

Here's the patch in the required SEARCH/REPLACE format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            and has_change_permission\n=======\n            and has_add_permission\n            and has_change_permission\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This modification adds the `has_add_permission` condition to the evaluation, ensuring the "save_as_new" button is only shown when the user has the add permission, aligning the feature with the intended permission model.

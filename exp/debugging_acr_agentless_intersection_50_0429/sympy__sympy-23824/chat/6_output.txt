To address the bug where the leading uncontracted gamma matrices are inserted in reverse order, I'll make a patch for the `kahane_simplify` function. The correction is to modify how results are combined with the `prepend_indices` list, ensuring the indices retain their original order during the final merging step.

Here's the patch:

```pythony
### sympy/physics/hep/gamma_matrices.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
expr1 = prepend_indices
expr2 = list(reversed(prepend_indices))
resulting_indices = [expri + ri for ri in resulting_indices for expri in (expr1, expr2)]
=======
resulting_indices = [prepend_indices + ri for ri in resulting_indices]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This patch modifies the code to prepend the indices in their original order instead of reversing them. Let's put this in JSON format.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/physics/hep/gamma_matrices.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nexpr1 = prepend_indices\nexpr2 = list(reversed(prepend_indices))\nresulting_indices = [expri + ri for ri in resulting_indices for expri in (expr1, expr2)]\n=======\nresulting_indices = [prepend_indices + ri for ri in resulting_indices]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

Make sure to test the modified function on several cases to ensure it correctly simplifies gamma matrix products without reversing the order of uncontracted leading gamma matrices.

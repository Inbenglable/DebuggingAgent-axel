To address the issue with the printing of matrix symbol expressions, we need to modify the printing functions to handle subtraction of matrix symbols correctly. Here's how the solution can be implemented, focusing on the `_print_Add` methods for `LatexPrinter`, `StrPrinter`, and `PrettyPrinter`.

For each of these, when dealing with a subtraction, which is internally represented as an addition with negative coefficients, the printer should directly recognize `MatrixSymbol` subtractions and format them without using the negative multiplication approach. 

Here is the set of changes:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/printing/latex.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            elif _coeff_isneg(term):\n=======\n            elif _coeff_isneg(term) and not isinstance(term, MatrixSymbol):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### sympy/printing/str.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            if t.startswith('-'):\n=======\n            if t.startswith('-') and not isinstance(term, MatrixSymbol):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            if term.is_Mul and _coeff_isneg(term):\n=======\n            if term.is_Mul and _coeff_isneg(term) and not isinstance(term, MatrixSymbol):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

These search and replace operations ensure that the changes are specific to non-matrix symbol classes where the current behavior is correct and maintain how matrix symbols should be displayed when subtracted. This ensures that matrix symbol operations retain clear and expected printing formats across different sympy print methods.

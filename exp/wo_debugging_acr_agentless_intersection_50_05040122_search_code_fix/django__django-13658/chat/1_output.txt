To resolve this issue, I need to locate the `ManagementUtility` class and its initialization method, which is the `__init__` method. Since the exact file path is not provided, I will need to search for the `ManagementUtility` class in the codebase to find the file where it is defined.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ManagementUtility")
```

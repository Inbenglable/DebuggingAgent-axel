To address the issue, I need to consider properties alongside functions when handling docstrings in the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass. To do this effectively, I should use the `inspect.isproperty` function in addition to `inspect.isfunction`. I already have the necessary code for the `InheritDocstrings` class and its `__init__` method, which is where the changes will be made. Therefore, I have sufficient information to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

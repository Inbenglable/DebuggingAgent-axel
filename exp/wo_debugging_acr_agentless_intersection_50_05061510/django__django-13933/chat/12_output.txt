### Review of Patch

The patch modifies the line in `django/forms/models.py` file to include the invalid choice value in the `ValidationError` message. The original code raised a `ValidationError` with a message from `self.error_messages['invalid_choice']`, which did not specify the invalid value. The change replaces this with a message that interpolates the invalid value using `% {'value': value}`. 

This modification appears to correctly inject the invalid choice value into the error message, addressing the issue described in the bug report.

### Analysis of Test Output

#### Original Output
The original test output shows a `ModuleNotFoundError` indicating that the `reproducer` module cannot be found. This error suggests that the test setup or environment configuration is incorrect, preventing the test from running and assessing whether the invalid choice value is included in the error message.

#### Patched Output
The patched test output presents the same `ModuleNotFoundError` as seen in the original output. Because of this environment error, the test does not run and cannot verify if the issue has been resolved.

### Conclusion

Due to the environment setup issue (`ModuleNotFoundError`), neither the original nor the patched test outputs confirm whether the error message is resolved. The patch itself correctly addresses the insertion of the invalid choice value into the error message, but without a successful test execution, we cannot definitively determine if the issue is resolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

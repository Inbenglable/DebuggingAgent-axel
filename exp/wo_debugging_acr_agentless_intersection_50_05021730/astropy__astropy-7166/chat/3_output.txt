To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve more information about the `InheritDocstrings` class implementation, specifically the parts where `inspect.isfunction` is used, so I can understand how it currently functions and how to modify it to handle properties. Although the initial retrieval provided the class definition, it lacks implementation details such as the `__init__` method and any other relevant methods of the metaclass.

```python
search_code_in_file("astropy/utils/misc.py", "inspect.isfunction")
```

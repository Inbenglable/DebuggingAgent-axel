The error message indicates that Django settings are not correctly configured, specifically the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting is not properly set up. The code attempts to set up Django settings manually using `settings.configure()`, but it still experiences issues because the execution environment doesn't seem to recognize this configuration step.

The code fails while trying to import objects from `django.contrib.auth.models`, which requires Django apps to be installed and configured properly. This suggests two potential issues:
1. The `settings.configure()` call is not being executed at the right point or is not sufficient to properly set up Django's application registry.
2. Importing the `User` and `Permission` models before the Django apps have been configured may not be the right way to set up the test, as it requires certain Django setup routines to be complete.

Before diving into deeper tracing, the fundamental issue is related to improper or insufficient Django configuration setup, rather than a method issue at this point.

To address the observed issue, I will focus on analyzing the setup process in the test file to ensure Django is configured correctly before attempting imports that depend on it.

Observed method: `/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-11149/reproduce.py:settings.configure`

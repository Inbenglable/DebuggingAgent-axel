To determine whether the issue is fixed, let's review the patch and analyze the test outputs before and after applying the patch.

### Review of the Patch

The patch modifies the handling of `CompoundModel` within the `astropy/modeling/separable.py` file. The original code computes a combined separability matrix using `_operators[transform.op]` for `sepleft` and `sepright`, but doesn't account for scenarios where the shape of the resulting matrix might need adjustment for nested models.

The patch introduces:
- The computation of an intermediate `combined_matrix`.
- Creation of a new `result_matrix` with shape adjusted to match the number of outputs for nested models.
- Retention of the original separability matrix's computed shape using slicing: `result_matrix[:combined_matrix.shape[0], :combined_matrix.shape[1]] = combined_matrix`.

### Test Output Analysis

- **Original Output:** The test failed with an `AssertionError` because the actual separability matrix did not match the expected matrix for a nested compound model.
  
- **Patched Output:** The test still fails with an `AssertionError`. This indicates that after applying the patch, the `separability_matrix` computation still didn't match the expected output, suggesting that the patch did not resolve the underlying issue.

Given that the test output remains unchanged and the test still fails post-patch, it is clear that the intended fix did not address the original issue.

**Conclusion:**

Issue resolved: `False`

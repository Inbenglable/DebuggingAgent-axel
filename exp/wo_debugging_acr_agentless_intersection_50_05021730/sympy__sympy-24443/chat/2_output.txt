I need to retrieve the source code of the `_image` function from the file `sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py` to better understand how it handles the case for `PermutationGroup`, specifically around lines 336-337 as indicated in the issue. This will help me identify how to simplify or correct the homomorphism handling for inverted generators.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py", "_image")
```

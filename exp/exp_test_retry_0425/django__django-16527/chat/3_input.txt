## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
"show_save_as_new" in admin can add without this permission
Description
	 
		(last modified by Mariusz Felisiak)
	 
At "django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py" file, line 102, I think you must put one more verification for this tag: "and has_add_permission", because "save_as_new" is a add modification.
I rewrite this for my project:
			"show_save_as_new": not is_popup
			and has_add_permission # This line that I put!!!
			and has_change_permission
			and change
			and save_as,

</ISSUE>


A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
To first analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior, we start by understanding the issue:

The issue highlights that the "show_save_as_new" context variable inside the `submit_row` method should have an additional permission check for `has_add_permission`. Without this, users who do not have add permission might still see the "Save as new" option in the admin interface.

**Expected Behavior:**
- When `has_add_permission` is False, `show_save_as_new` should also be False.
- When `has_add_permission` is True and `has_change_permission` is True, `show_save_as_new` should be True.
- `show_save_as_new` should always be False if `save_as` is False, regardless of permissions.

**Observed Behavior:**
The created test has highlighted the following:
- In Test Case 1, where `has_add_permission` is set to False, the context variable `show_save_as_new` is incorrectly True, which indicates the permission is not correctly enforced.
- In Test Case 2, `show_save_as_new` behaves correctly, implying adequate permissions.
- In Test Case 3, when `save_as` is False, `show_save_as_new` is correctly turned to False.

The test results indicate that the problematic behavior is occurring because the code lacks the `has_add_permission` check in the determination of `show_save_as_new`.

**Location of Issue:**
The bug resides within the `submit_row` method in the file `django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py`, specifically where the `show_save_as_new` context variable is constructed:

```python
"show_save_as_new": not is_popup
and has_change_permission
and change
and save_as,
```

Given this analysis, we can conclude with:

Buggy method: `django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py:submit_row`
==================================================

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue, I need to examine the source code of the `submit_row` method in the file `django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py`. Let's retrieve that code so I can ensure the correct logic and apply the necessary patch.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py", "submit_row")
```

Your API invoke result:

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

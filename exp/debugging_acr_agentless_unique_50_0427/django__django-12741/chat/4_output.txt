To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code of the `execute_sql_flush` method from the `BaseDatabaseOperations` class located in `django/db/backends/base/operations.py`. This will allow me to understand its current implementation and make the necessary changes.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/base/operations.py", "BaseDatabaseOperations.execute_sql_flush")
```

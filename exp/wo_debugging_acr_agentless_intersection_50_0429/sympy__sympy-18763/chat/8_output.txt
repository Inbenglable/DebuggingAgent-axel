I need to retrieve the source code responsible for the LaTeX printing of `Subs` in the Sympy project to generate the patch for proper parenthesizing. Since the `Subs` class is defined in `sympy/core/function.py`, and the `latex` method is within `sympy/printing/latex.py`, I need to locate the specific function handling LaTeX printing of `Subs`.

I'll proceed with the necessary retrieval now:

```python
search_method_in_codebase("Subs._latex")
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/latex.py", "_print_Subs")
```

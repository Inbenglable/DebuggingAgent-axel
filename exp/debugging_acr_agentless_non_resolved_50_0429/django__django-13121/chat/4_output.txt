To address the issue, I need to inspect the `convert_durationfield_value` method in the `django/db/backends/base/operations.py` file. This method was highlighted as the potential point of failure in the debugging observations, and understanding its current implementation is crucial before generating the patch.

I'll proceed with searching for the method implementation in the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/base/operations.py", "convert_durationfield_value")
```

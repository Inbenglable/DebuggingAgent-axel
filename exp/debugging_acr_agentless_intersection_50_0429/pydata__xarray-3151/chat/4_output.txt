The issue is occurring in the `combine_by_coords` function, specifically related to the enforcement of coordinate monotonicity constraints. Here's what we have analyzed and understood so far:

- The function attempts to combine datasets by inspecting their coordinates and metadata. It uses `concat` and `merge` strategies to accomplish this task.
- The problem arises when non-varying identical coordinate dimensions between datasets are non-monotonic, leading to a `ValueError` because `combine_by_coords` enforces a monotonic global index order (lines 507-511).
- The xarray documentation suggests that coordinate dimensions which do not vary between datasets should be ignored for monotonicity purposes.

Given that the monotonicity check is applied at lines 504-511, and this check might not cater to the documented behavior, these lines warrant further analysis to ensure they align with the intended functionality.

Let's trace the code more closely around these lines to gather more insights, especially look into the logic for deciding which dimensions to apply the monotonic checks to and how these checks are performed.

Observed scope: `xarray/core/combine.py:504-511`

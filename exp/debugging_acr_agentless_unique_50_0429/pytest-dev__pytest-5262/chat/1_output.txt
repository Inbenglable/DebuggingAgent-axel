To start resolving the issue related to the `_pytest.capture.EncodedFile` class, we need to understand where the `write()` method is being called with `bytes` instead of the expected `str`.

Let's analyze the context provided:

1. **Issue Description**:
   - The error occurs when youtube-dl writes logs to pytest's captured output.
   - The `write()` method in `_pytest.capture.EncodedFile` expects `str` but is receiving `bytes`.
   - The root cause seems to be that `_pytest.capture.EncodedFile` advertises the binary mode (`rb+`) due to the underlying stream, which leads to incorrect type expectations.

2. **Observations from the Reproduced Test**:
   - The error trace indicates a `TypeError` because `write()` is called with `bytes`.
   - The test implementation tries to execute `youtube_dl.YoutubeDL().to_screen("Test message")`.

Given the context, the problem likely lies in the `_pytest.capture.EncodedFile` class and how modes (including binary) are being handled, leading to wrong expectations in the type of the object being written.

Before jumping to conclusions, I will first observe the `write()` method within the `_pytest.capture.EncodedFile` class to trace how the mode is affecting the type check and why it leads to the `TypeError`.

Observed method: `_pytest/capture.py:EncodedFile.write`

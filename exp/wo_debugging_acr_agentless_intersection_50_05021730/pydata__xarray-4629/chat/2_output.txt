I need to retrieve the relevant part of the `merge_core` function that handles the `combine_attrs` logic with `"override"` as its value to resolve the issue. This should give us insight into the problem identified in the `merge` function. 

Let's proceed with searching for the `merge_core` method in the specified file:

```python
search_method_in_file("xarray/core/merge.py", "merge_core")
```

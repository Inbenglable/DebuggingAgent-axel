Here is the patch to resolve the issue. We're checking if the `return_` is `None` before attempting to call the `to` method, which should resolve the error in the `quantity_input` decorator when a `None` return type is specified.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### astropy/units/decorators.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                return return_.to(wrapped_signature.return_annotation)\n=======\n                if return_ is not None:\n                    return return_.to(wrapped_signature.return_annotation)\n                else:\n                    return return_\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
``` 

This change ensures that the code will safely handle a `None` return value without attempting to call the `to` method on it.

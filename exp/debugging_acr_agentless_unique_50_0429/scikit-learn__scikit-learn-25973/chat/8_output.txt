In reviewing the patch and the test results before and after the patch application, the key points to consider are as follows:

### Patch Overview:
The patch introduces a change where the cross-validation generator (`cv`) is converted to a list in the SequentialFeatureSelector's code. This change aims to prevent the exhaustion of the generator on repeated use during the cross-validation process:
```python
# Convert generator to a list to prevent exhaustion
splits_list = list(self.cv) if hasattr(self.cv, '__iter__') else self.cv
```
This modification ensures that `cv` can be reused by converting the iterable to a list before it is exhausted in the first pass.

### Test Output Analysis:

#### Original Output:
The test failed with an `IndexError: list index out of range` exception when trying to index into `scores[0]`, indicating that the scores list is empty. This happened because the cv generator was exhausted in the initial run, leaving no splits for subsequent operations.

#### Patched Output:
After applying the patch, the same error occurs: `IndexError: list index out of range`. The problem persists because the generator (`cv`) is likely converted to a list too late or not in the correct scope thereby still being exhausted before it can be utilized fully.

### Conclusion:
The attempt to fix the issue did not lead to successful execution of the test case. The error encountered ("IndexError: list index out of range") is unchanged, indicating the generator is still being improperly handled or converted late. Consequently, the solution isn't effective in resolving the specific problem described in the issue.

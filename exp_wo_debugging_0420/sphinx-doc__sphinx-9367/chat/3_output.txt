To address the issue with rendering 1-element tuples correctly, we first need to identify the part of the code that manages the rendering logic. The file `tests/test_pycode_ast.py` includes tests related to parsing and likely contains references to the underlying logic governing the rendering process. 

The test method `test_unparse_py38` seems to deal with parsing and unparse tasks, which might play a role in how tuples are displayed. To ensure we understand the changes needed, it's vital to look at the existing code around tuple handling for rendering. Therefore, I need to identify and inspect portions of the code where `ast.unparse` or similar unparse operations are implemented.

The next step is to search for the relevant method where tuple unparsing might be handled.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("unparse")
```

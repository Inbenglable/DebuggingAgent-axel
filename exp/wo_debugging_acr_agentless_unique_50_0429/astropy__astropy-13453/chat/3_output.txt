To address the issue, I need to delve into the implementation of the `write` function within the `astropy/io/ascii/ui.py` file and investigate the specific Writer class used for HTML output. Given that the `get_writer` method hints at writer classes like `basic.Basic`, I need to identify which class corresponds to HTML writing and see if it correctly handles the `formats` dictionary.

To continue, I will retrieve the code for the `write` method, which might also call other methods or classes directly involved with HTML writing. I'll prioritize understanding how the `formats` are processed when writing in HTML format.

I'll start by looking into any HTML writer classes or search for `HTML` components to pinpoint the responsibility for HTML formatting.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("HTML")
search_class_in_file("astropy/io/ascii/ui.py", "HTML")
search_method_in_file("astropy/io/ascii/ui.py", "write")
search_method_in_file("astropy/io/ascii/ui.py", "get_writer")
```

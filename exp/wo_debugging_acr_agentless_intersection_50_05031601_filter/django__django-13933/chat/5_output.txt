To generate the patch for this issue, I need to ensure I have the source code for the `Field` class where the `validate` method raises the `ValidationError`. Since I have already obtained the implementation of the `Field.validate` method and confirmed where validation errors are being raised for invalid choices, I now need to verify if there is any final code related to `ModelChoiceField` where it uses or customizes the `validate` method from its superclass, although it appears that the error is raised by the `Field` class directly.

Since we are aiming to modify `ModelChoiceField`'s default error message, the core task involves ensuring the `params={'value': value}` is passed to the `ValidationError`, which was confirmed in the `Field.validate` method provided. Therefore, as we get ready to modify the `ModelChoiceField` class, I believe I have gathered all the necessary source code to implement these changes.

Ready generation: `True`

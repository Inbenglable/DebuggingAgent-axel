Based on the information gathered, the issue arises in the `only_relation_agnostic_fields` method, where the deletion of the 'to' key results in a `KeyError`. To apply the suggested fix, I need to gather the source code for the `only_relation_agnostic_fields` method to understand its context and proceed with the patch.

I'll proceed by searching for the `only_relation_agnostic_fields` method within the `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/autodetector.py", "MigrationAutodetector.only_relation_agnostic_fields")
```

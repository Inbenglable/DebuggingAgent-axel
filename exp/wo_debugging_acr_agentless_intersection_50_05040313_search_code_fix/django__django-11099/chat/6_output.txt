To address the issue of the `UsernameValidator` allowing trailing newlines in usernames, we need to adjust the regular expressions used in both `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator`. We will replace the `$` regex pattern with `\A` and `\Z`.

Here are the necessary *SEARCH/REPLACE* patch edits:

```python
### django/contrib/auth/validators.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    regex = r'^[\w.@+-]+$'
=======
    regex = r'\A[\w.@+-]+\Z'
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This patch will modify both instances where the regular expression appears in the `django/contrib/auth/validators.py` file.

Here is the final JSON representation of the patch edits:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/auth/validators.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    regex = r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'\n=======\n    regex = r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

Please apply this patch to resolve the issue.

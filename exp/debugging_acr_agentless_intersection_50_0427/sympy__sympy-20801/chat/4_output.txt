In the retrieved method `Float.__eq__`, it's evident that the asymmetry in comparison is due to how Booleans are treated when the `Float` value is zero. The method currently checks for `if not self` (which is true for zero), and then returns `not other`, which results in the Boolean conversion issue with `S.false`.

To fix this issue, I need to modify the `Float.__eq__` method to handle comparisons with `S.false` explicitly. I have enough information and code to generate the patch for this issue.

Ready generation: `True`

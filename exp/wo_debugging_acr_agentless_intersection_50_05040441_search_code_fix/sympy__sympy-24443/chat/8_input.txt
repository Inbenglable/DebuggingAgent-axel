You are a PR reviewer that needs to review the patch generated by a bug repair agent and determine whether the issue is fixed or not.
This is the bug issue, which is in the **sympy** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
`_check_homomorphism` is broken on PermutationGroups
```python
In [1]: from sympy.combinatorics import *
   ...: from sympy.combinatorics.homomorphisms import homomorphism
   ...: D3 = DihedralGroup(3)
   ...: T = homomorphism(D3, D3, D3.generators, D3.generators)

ValueError: The given images do not define a homomorphism
```

The issue is in the internal `_image()` function, where it handles the case of a `PermutationGroup`:

https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/809c53c077485ca48a206cee78340389cb83b7f1/sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py#L336-L337

When `r[i]` is an inverted generator, the `in gens` test fails.

I think the whole thing can be greatly simplified.

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
## REPRODUCE TEST
```
# reproducer.py

from sympy.combinatorics import DihedralGroup
from sympy.combinatorics.homomorphisms import homomorphism
import traceback
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        D3 = DihedralGroup(3)
        T = homomorphism(D3, D3, D3.generators, D3.generators)
        # If no exception is raised, the issue might be fixed
        print("No exception raised, the issue might be fixed.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except ValueError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The given images do not define a homomorphism")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

And this is the original output when running the test (before applying the patch):

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

```

The repair agent has tried to generate a patch to fix the issue:
## PATCH CONTEXT
<PATCH_CONTEXT>
To address the issue described, I will simplify the `_image()` function in the `_check_homomorphism` method to handle inverted generators correctly. The main change will be ensuring that the homomorphism is checked even when generators are inverted.

Let's define the changes needed:

```python
### sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            i = 0
            j = 0
            # i is the index for r and j is for
            # r_arr. r_arr[j] is the tuple (sym, p)
            # where sym is the generator symbol
            # and p is the power to which it is
            # raised while r[i] is a generator
            # (not just its symbol) or the inverse of
            # a generator - hence the need for
            # both indices
            while i < len(r):
                power = r_arr[j][1]

                    s = domain.generators[gens.index(r[i])]
                else:
                    s = r[i]
                if s in images:
                    w = w*images[s]**power
                elif s**-1 in images:
                    w = w*images[s**-1]**power
                i += abs(power)
                j += 1
=======
                # find the generator corresponding to sym
                if sym in gens:
                    idx = gens.index(sym)
                    gen = domain.generators[idx]
                    # Check both the generator and its inverse
                    if gen in images:
                        w = w * images[gen] ** power
                    elif gen**-1 in images:
                        w = w * images[gen**-1] ** -power

```

To determine whether the issue is resolved, let's first review the provided information and analyze the outcomes:

1. **Issue Description:**
   - The `call_command` fails when an argument from a mutually exclusive group is passed via keyword arguments (`kwargs`) and not interpreted correctly because the current code only accounts for individually required arguments, ignoring mutually exclusive groups.

2. **Test Details:**
   - The test attempts to run a custom command that has a mutually exclusive group of arguments using `call_command('command', shop_id=1)`.
   - Expected functionality is that this call should be valid as 'shop_id' is part of a required mutually exclusive group.

3. **Original Error Output:**
   - The error indicates that the 'command' isn't recognized, specifically a `CommandError` for "Unknown command: 'command'". This shows that the command was not registered correctly for testing.

4. **Patch Review:**
   - The patch attempts to adjust `parse_args` to recognize and validate mutually exclusive groups as `required` if any part of the group is passed.
   - However, it appears this logic was never actually tested with a valid command due to the initial registration problem.

5. **Patched Output Analysis:**
   - Post-patch, the error remains unchanged: "Unknown command: 'command'". 
   - This is the same issue as the pre-patch scenario, indicating the patch doesn't resolve the root cause of the test failure.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The test is failing due to a misconfiguration or setup issue where the custom command is not registered correctly, and this should be resolved for meaningful testing of the patch.
   - The bug related explicitly to `call_command` and mutually exclusive groups may still be present, but the evidence from the test output can't confirm this due to the separate issue concerning "Unknown command: 'command'."

Considering the above points, the reported issue does not seem to be fixed based on the current test configuration and outcomes.

**Issue resolved:** `False`

To proceed with generating a patch, I need to review the source code related to the `linkcheck` command and its handling of anchor and HTTP error reporting. Specifically, I need to understand the part of the code responsible for reporting errors in `linkcheck` when `linkcheck_anchors` is set to `True`.

I will start by searching for the `linkcheck` functionality and related methods. Here's how I'll proceed:

1. Search for the method related to link checking in the codebase, since the specific file is not mentioned.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("linkcheck")
```

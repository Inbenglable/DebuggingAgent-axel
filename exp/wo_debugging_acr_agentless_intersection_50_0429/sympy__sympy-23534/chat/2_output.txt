In order to resolve the issue with the `symbols` function not working properly when there is an extra layer of parentheses, I need to analyze the code and determine where the problem might be. The relevant code and logic reside in the `sympy/core/symbol.py` file where the `symbols` function is defined. I need to ensure that I understand how the `symbols` function interacts with tuples or sequences when specifying a `cls` argument like `Function`. 

Given that the root cause seems to be related to handling tuples or sequences within the `symbols` function, I already have the main function code that I need to examine, namely `symbols`. Now, let's proceed to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

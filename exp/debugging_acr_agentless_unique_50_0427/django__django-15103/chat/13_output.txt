### Analysis of Current Observed Code

The snippet from `django/template/defaulttags.py` demonstrates how to parse the `ifchanged` template tag. This method utilizes the Django template engine to compile filters and manage nodes within the template syntax. The tokens are processed to create conditional logic in the templates, providing operations for cases where specific conditions are met (`ifchanged`).

### Abnormal Program Behavior

The core abnormal behavior related to the issue at hand involves the `json_script` template tag not being found. This suggests a problem with tag registration, where `json_script` either isn't within defined libraries or misreferenced in the Django project. The runtime trace for the existing setting suggests an `AssertionError`, which relates more to the debugging tool environment — particularly around a missing file path needed by the tracer setup. The primary focus, however, remains on resolving the lack of registration or existence for the `json_script` tag.

### Next Steps

To accurately pinpoint where the issue lies, the work should shift towards exploring areas responsible for tag management, initialization, or registration within the Django framework. This would typically involve inspecting the `templatetags` responsible for registering or defining custom tags within Django.

The facility for `json_script` needs an evaluation where it should have been defined or registered within Django’s template system.

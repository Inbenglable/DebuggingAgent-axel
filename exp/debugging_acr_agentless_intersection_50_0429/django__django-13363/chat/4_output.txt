To resolve the issue, I need to examine the source code for the method `TruncDate.as_sql` within the file `django/db/models/functions/datetime.py`. This will allow me to create an appropriate patch to handle the `tzinfo` parameter correctly.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncDate.as_sql")
```

The patch effectively addresses the issue in the `quantity_input` decorator where it fails for constructors with a type-hinted return value of `None`. The primary problem was the attempt to call `.to()` method on a `NoneType` object, which resulted in an `AttributeError`. 

### Analysis of the Patch:

- **Original Code:**
  - Attempts to use `.to()` method on `return_`, which causes an error if `return_` is `None`.

- **Modified Code:**
  - Introduces a conditional check to ensure `return_` is not `None` before invoking `.to()`.
  - Returns `return_` directly if it is `None`, preventing the `AttributeError`.

The modification resolves the original issue by handling cases where `None` is returned from the constructor, thus maintaining the expected functionality for other return types.

### Test Output:

- **Original Output:** 
  - An `AttributeError` is raised, confirming the presence of the issue.

- **Patched Output:** 
  - The message "The issue is fixed." is printed, indicating that the exception is no longer raised, and the PoC class can be instantiated without error.

The patch clearly fixes the reported issue by bypassing the `.to()` call when `None` is returned, allowing for normal operation even when type hints specify `None` as the return type.

Issue resolved: `True`

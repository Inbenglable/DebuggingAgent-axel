To address the issue regarding the inappropriate inclusion of `Meta.ordering` fields in the `GROUP BY` clause, I need to locate and potentially modify the code responsible for query generation, particularly where the `Meta.ordering` might be affecting the `GROUP BY` clause.

As a starting point, I should retrieve the existing implementation related to query construction, focusing on how the `Meta.ordering` interacts with `GROUP BY`. This will likely involve examining the ORM components within Django, such as the queryset or query generation logic in the `Query` or `QuerySet` classes.

I'll proceed by retrieving relevant source code to identify the specific points where changes might be required.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Query")
search_class_in_codebase("QuerySet")
search_method_in_codebase("add_fields")
search_method_in_codebase("add_ordering")
```

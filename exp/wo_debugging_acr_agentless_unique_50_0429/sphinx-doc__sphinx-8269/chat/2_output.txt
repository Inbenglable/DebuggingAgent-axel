To resolve the issue, I need to inspect the part of the Sphinx project responsible for link checking, particularly the logic dealing with anchor checking and HTTP status codes. This issue seems related to the behavior when processing hyperlinks and determining their validity based on HTTP status and the presence of anchors.

Let's first locate the method or class responsible for this link-checking functionality. Since we haven't been provided with the exact file or method name, we'll search within the codebase for relevant functionality related to link checking.

I'll start by searching for common terms related to link checking, like `check` or `linkcheck`, which might be part of the method or class names.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("check")
search_method_in_codebase("linkcheck")
```

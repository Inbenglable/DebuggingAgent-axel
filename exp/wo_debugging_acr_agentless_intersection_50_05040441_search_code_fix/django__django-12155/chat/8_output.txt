To resolve the issue described in the `trim_docstring` function where docstrings must handle cases even when the first line is not empty, I will adjust the code to skip the first line when calculating the minimum indentation. This will ensure that the indentation logic correctly processes such docstrings without raising errors.

Here's the necessary patch for the `trim_docstring` function:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())\n=======\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```
This patch modifies the function to avoid considering the first line when determining the common indentation across all lines of the docstring, which prevents the error observed when the first line of the docstring is not empty.

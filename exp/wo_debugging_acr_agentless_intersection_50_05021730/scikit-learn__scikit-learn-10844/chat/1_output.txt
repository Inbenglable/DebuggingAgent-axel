To address this issue in the `scikit-learn` project, we'll need to inspect the source code of the `fowlkes_mallows_score` function in the `supervised.py` file. This will allow us to thoroughly understand the calculation in question and properly implement the proposed fix. Based on the issue description, our goal is to modify the computation that currently occurs at line 859.

Let's retrieve the source code for the `fowlkes_mallows_score` function:

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/metrics/cluster/supervised.py", "fowlkes_mallows_score")
```

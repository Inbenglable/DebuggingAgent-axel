I'm ready to generate the patch based on the information retrieved. The next step will involve modifying the `FileInput` class to properly override or implement the `use_required_attribute` method, similar to how it's done in `ClearableFileInput`. This will ensure the `required` attribute doesn't appear when there is initial data present.

Ready generation: `True`

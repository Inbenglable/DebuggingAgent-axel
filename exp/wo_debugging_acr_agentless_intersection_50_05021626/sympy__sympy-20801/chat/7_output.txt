In order to generate a patch, I need to implement or modify the `__eq__` method in the `BooleanAtom` class or its specific subclasses such as `BooleanFalse`. This would address the inconsistency when comparing instances of sympy's boolean singleton objects with numerical representations of zero.

To do that, I need to first retrieve the source code of `BooleanAtom` to guide the implementation and modification of the `__eq__` method precisely in the targeting class (`BooleanFalse`). I already have information about `BooleanTrue` and `BooleanFalse`, but I need to ensure the remaining logic in `BooleanAtom` is aligned so that subclasses can act accordingly. Hence, I'm ready to generate the patch based on collected insights.

Ready generation: `True`

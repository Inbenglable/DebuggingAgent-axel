Bug in posix implementation of django/core/files/locks.py
Description
	
The posix version of locks (the version which supports import fcntl) has a bug. The code attempts to return True to indicate success or failure acquiring a lock, but instead it always returns False. The reason is that cpython fcntl module returns None if successful, and raises an OSError to indicate failure (see â€‹https://docs.python.org/3/library/fcntl.html#fcntl.flock).
Anyone interested in using the non-blocking (i.e. locks.LOCKS_NB) requires a valid return value to know if they have successfully acquired the lock.
I believe the correct implementation should be the following:
diff --git a/django/core/files/locks.py b/django/core/files/locks.py

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
The issue arises because the posix implementation of the lock function in `django/core/files/locks.py` inaccurately determines the success of acquiring a lock. According to the documented behavior of Python's `fcntl.flock`, calling it successfully returns `None`, while failing raises an `OSError`. The current implementation erroneously checks if the return value is equal to zero (`ret == 0`) to ascertain success. This check is flawed because it evaluates `None == 0` as `False`.

The testing output confirms this misbehavior:

1. **Test 1: Basic locking**: The expected lock acquisition (`True`) results in `False`.

2. **Test 2: Non-blocking lock when file is already locked**: The first lock acquisition also inaccurately returns `False`. Subsequently, trying to acquire a non-blocking lock results in a `BlockingIOError`, evidencing that the first lock was indeed acquired, contradicting the program output.

This behavior indicates the `locks.lock()` and `locks.unlock()` methods do not correctly represent the lock status based on their return values, as they are using the incorrect method of determining success.

Therefore, given the information and understanding:

Buggy method: `django/core/files/locks.py:lock`
==================================================


Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

The error occurs when `is_fits` is called and the `args` list is empty, leading to an `IndexError` when attempting to access `args[0]`. To fix this, we need to modify the `is_fits` method to handle the case when `args` is empty appropriately.

Since the `identify_format` method calls various identifier functions, including `is_fits`, we should ensure that `is_fits` function handles empty `args`, thus preventing the `IndexError`.

Here's the adjusted plan:
1. Modify the `is_fits` method to add a check before accessing `args[0]`.

With the gathered code, I am ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

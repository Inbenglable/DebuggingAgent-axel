You are a bug repair agent to resolve issues and submit pull requests.
Now You need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
method_decorator() should preserve wrapper assignments
Description
	
the function that is passed to the decorator is a partial object and does not have any of the attributes expected from a function i.e. __name__, __module__ etc...
consider the following case
def logger(func):
	@wraps(func)
	def inner(*args, **kwargs):
		try:
			result = func(*args, **kwargs)
		except Exception as e:
			result = str(e)
		finally:
			logger.debug(f"{func.__name__} called with args: {args} and kwargs: {kwargs} resulting: {result}")
	return inner
class Test:
	@method_decorator(logger)
	def hello_world(self):
		return "hello"
Test().test_method()
This results in the following exception
AttributeError: 'functools.partial' object has no attribute '__name__'

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue related to `method_decorator` not preserving wrapper assignments which results in missing function attributes, we need to inspect the source code of the `method_decorator` function in the Django project. The aim is to ensure that the `@wraps` decorator, which is part of Python's standard library (`functools`), is correctly applied to maintain these attributes.

I need to retrieve the source code of the `method_decorator` function to modify its implementation to correctly utilize `functools.wraps`. I will search for the `method_decorator` function's source code within the Django codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("method_decorator")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("method_decorator")

```python
def method_decorator(decorator, name=''):
    """
    Convert a function decorator into a method decorator
    """
    # 'obj' can be a class or a function. If 'obj' is a function at the time it
    # is passed to _dec,  it will eventually be a method of the class it is
    # defined on. If 'obj' is a class, the 'name' is required to be the name
    # of the method that will be decorated.
    def _dec(obj):
        if not isinstance(obj, type):
            return _multi_decorate(decorator, obj)
        if not (name and hasattr(obj, name)):

    # meaningless.

        update_wrapper(_dec, decorator)

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

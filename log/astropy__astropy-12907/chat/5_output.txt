To address the issue with the `separability_matrix` function not computing separability correctly for nested `CompoundModels`, I've reviewed the `_separable` method. The current structure of the `_separable` method hints that the problem might lie in how the `_operators[transform.op]` is combining the separability matrices for nested models.

The next step involves examining the `_operators` dictionary to understand how these operators are defined and used to combine separability matrices. Therefore, I need to retrieve the relevant source code for the `_operators` dictionary or any related logic that defines how the combinational operators work in the context of the `separability_matrix` computation.

Let's retrieve the necessary code related to `_operators` in `astropy/modeling/separable.py`.

```python
search_code_in_file("astropy/modeling/separable.py", "_operators")
```

To address the issue, I need to modify how validation errors are raised for the `invalid_choice` scenario in the `ModelChoiceField` class. I need to examine how the `to_python` method works in detail, as it's a critical step where conversion and validation likely occur, potentially interacting with the validation error handling.

Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code for the `to_python` method from the `django/forms/models.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/forms/models.py", "ModelChoiceField.to_python")
```

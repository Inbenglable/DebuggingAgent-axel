Based on the information and analysis provided, the issue arises because non-dimensional coordinates are omitted when intersecting `window_dim` with `self.obj.coords`. We will adjust the `should_be_coords` to include all original coordinates.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### xarray/core/rolling.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        should_be_coords = set(window_dim) & set(self.obj.coords)\n=======\n        should_be_coords = set(self.obj.coords.keys())\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
``` 

This patch changes the calculation of `should_be_coords` to include all coordinates initially present in `self.obj.coords`, ensuring that non-dimensional coordinates are retained after the coarsen operation.

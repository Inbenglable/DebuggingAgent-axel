To patch the issue with `ModelChoiceField` not displaying the invalid choice value in its validation error messages, I need to access the specific implementation code for the `ModelChoiceField` class. This will allow me to make the necessary modifications. From the issue description, I understand that the error message doesn't include the `%(value)s` parameter that would allow displaying the invalid input.

To proceed, I need to obtain the source code of the `ModelChoiceField` class. Since the file name is not mentioned, I will search for the class in the codebase.

Let's proceed with retrieving the source code for the `ModelChoiceField` class.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ModelChoiceField")
```

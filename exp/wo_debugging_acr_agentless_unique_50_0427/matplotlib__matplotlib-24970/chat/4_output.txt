To proceed, I need to identify the surrounding method and class context in which these lines occur. It is crucial to gather information on how `xa`, `self._i_over`, `self._i_under`, and `self._i_bad` are defined and used. This context will guide the corrections needed for deprecation handling when converting out-of-bound values to integers.

Given that only lines around the mentioned snippet are available, I need to retrieve more information, particularly the containing method or class.

```python
search_class_in_file("lib/matplotlib/colors.py", "xa = xa.astype(int)")
```

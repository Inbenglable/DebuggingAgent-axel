To address this issue, I need to retrieve the source code of the `_convert_data_to_col` method within the `table.py` file of the Astropy project. This will help me examine the transformation logic to understand how to implement the proposed fix and add a `FutureWarning`.

I need to search for the method in the specified file as I have information regarding its location.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/table/table.py", "_convert_data_to_col")
```

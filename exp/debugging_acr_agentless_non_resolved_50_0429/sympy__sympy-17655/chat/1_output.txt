The error occurs because the operation of scalar multiplication with a `Point` object is being performed in reverse order in the expression `point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2`. The main issue arises in the handling of this expression where the `Point.__add__` method doesn't recognize the result of `sympify(2.0) * point2` as a valid operand, leading to the exception.

The issue seems to be rooted in:
1. The way multiplication of a `Point` object with a scalar (like `2.0`) is handled, particularly when the scalar operation creates a `Mul` object before the `Point` gets involved.
2. The subsequent addition of this result to another `Point` object in `Point.__add__` creates confusion due to types not being as expected.

Given these observations, I will need to delve into how the `Mul` and scalar multiplication are being processed for `Point` objects. Thus, the next step is to observe the scalar multiplication method to confirm the handling logic for `Point` objects.

Observed method: `sympy/geometry/point.py:Point.__mul__`

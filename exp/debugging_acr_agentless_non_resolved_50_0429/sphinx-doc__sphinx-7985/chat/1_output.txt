Since the issue describes a problem where local (internal) links are not being checked by the `linkcheck` builder in Sphinx, and given that the output also suggests a failure in detecting broken local links, we should start by examining the code in Sphinx responsible for handling and checking links in the documentation.

Given the context, it is likely that the relevant code will reside in the modules related to the `linkcheck` builder, as this builder is responsible for validating links.

Therefore, the next logical step is to dive into the `linkcheck` builder and explore how it processes links. We need to trace the methods involved in link validation to identify where local links might not be accounted for. 

Let's observe the `sphinx.builders.linkcheck` module, focusing particularly on the method responsible for collecting and checking links.

Observed method: `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py:LinkCheckBuilder.get_outdated_docs`

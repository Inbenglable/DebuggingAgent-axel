To address the issue at hand, we need to look into how the `symbols` function is working and how it reacts to the `cls` being set to `smp.Function`. The task is to ensure that when we pass a tuple of strings within parentheses, it should appropriately treat them as function symbols.

Given that the behavior discrepancy seems to involve the `symbols` function, we need to first inspect the source code for the `symbols` function in the Sympy library. This will help us understand how it processes the input when `cls=smp.Function` is specified and allows us to identify where the issue may be arising.

I will retrieve the source code for the `symbols` function to understand how it handles tuples and the extra layer of parentheses.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("symbols")
```

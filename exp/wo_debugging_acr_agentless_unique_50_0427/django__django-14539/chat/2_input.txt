## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
urlize() does not handle html escaped string and trailing punctuation correctly
Description
	
Example:
urlize('Search for google.com/?q=1&lt! and see.')
# expected output
'Search for <a href="http://google.com/?q=1%3C">google.com/?q=1&lt</a>! and see.'
# actual output
'Search for <a href="http://google.com/?q=1%3C">google.com/?q=1&lt</a>lt! and see.'

In the previous round, you called search APIs to retrieve relevant source code that would help identify the root cause of the issue and generate a patch. However, the code you retrieved appears in multiple locations (maybe some are irrelevant but have same key). So now your task is to determine which of the retrieved contents are indeed you need, and filter out the irrelevant ones.
This is your API invocation round output:
In order to resolve the issue, I need to understand how the `urlize()` function is currently implemented in the Django project. Therefore, I'll need to retrieve its source code.

Since the issue pertains specifically to the `urlize` function, and I don't have information about the file where this function is defined, I will need to search for the method in the project codebase.

I'll proceed with the necessary API call to locate the `urlize` function within the Django codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("urlize")
```

And this is the corresponding API returned result (each content is started with #### FILE_PATH:NAME):
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("urlize")
RESULT:
#### django/template/defaultfilters.py:urlize
```python
def urlize(value, autoescape=True):
    """Convert URLs in plain text into clickable links."""
    return mark_safe(_urlize(value, nofollow=True, autoescape=autoescape))

```

#### django/utils/html.py:urlize
```python
def urlize(text, trim_url_limit=None, nofollow=False, autoescape=False):
    """
    Convert any URLs in text into clickable links.

    Works on http://, https://, www. links, and also on links ending in one of
    the original seven gTLDs (.com, .edu, .gov, .int, .mil, .net, and .org).
    Links can have trailing punctuation (periods, commas, close-parens) and
    leading punctuation (opening parens) and it'll still do the right thing.

    If trim_url_limit is not None, truncate the URLs in the link text longer
    than this limit to trim_url_limit - 1 characters and append an ellipsis.

    If nofollow is True, give the links a rel="nofollow" attribute.

    If autoescape is True, autoescape the link text and URLs.

Among the API returned contents, there may be some irrelevant ones or not. So now you need to analyze each returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.
Now, please first analyze the API returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.

Then you need to choose you needed ones with the following format:
```
FILE_PATH_1:NAME_1
FILE_PATH_2:NAME_2
...
```

Note:
1. The value of FILE_PATH:NAME, must consistent with the API returned content (but remove the prefix ####).
2. You may select one or more contents, or even all of them if they are indeed you need.

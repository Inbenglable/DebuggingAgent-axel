To resolve the issue, I need to locate the `generate_renamed_models` method within the `autodetector.py` file. This method contains the problematic code as indicated in the stack trace provided in the issue description. 

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/autodetector.py", "Autodetector.generate_renamed_models")
```

To address the issue where `linkcheck` reports an incorrect error message, I need to inspect the relevant part of the code responsible for handling HTTP error status codes during the link checking process.

I'll begin by searching for relevant methods that handle link checking in the Sphinx codebase. It’s likely that there’s a method related to processing links or handling anchors. Since the issue implicates the `linkcheck` command, I'll search for methods or classes associated with link checking.

I'll start by searching for methods or classes related to "linkcheck" to locate the code responsible for handling HTTP errors.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("linkcheck")
search_class_in_codebase("linkcheck")
search_method_in_codebase("check_anchor")
```

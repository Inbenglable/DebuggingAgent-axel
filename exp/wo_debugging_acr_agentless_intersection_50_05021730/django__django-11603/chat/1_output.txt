To resolve the issue, I need to analyze the implementation of Avg and Sum aggregates in the Django project, specifically focusing on how DISTINCT is handled. To do so, I need to locate their respective classes and inspect their code. First, I'll search for the location of the Avg and Sum classes within the codebase, and then inspect their implementation.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Avg")
search_class_in_codebase("Sum")
```

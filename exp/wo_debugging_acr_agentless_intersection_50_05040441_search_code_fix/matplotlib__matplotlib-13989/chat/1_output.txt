To resolve the issue, we first need to retrieve the source code for the `hist` method from the Matplotlib repository. As the bug is related specifically to the handling of `range` and `density` parameters in `hist()`, locating where `hist()` is defined and understanding its logic is a necessary step. Since we don't have the exact file path, we'll need to search the codebase for the method `hist`.

Let's proceed with searching for `hist` in the codebase:

```python
search_method_in_codebase("hist")
```

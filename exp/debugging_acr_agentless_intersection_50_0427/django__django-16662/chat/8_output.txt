To address the issue related to the import ordering in Django migration files, we need to investigate how Django generates these migration files and particularly how import statements are handled. The problematic method involves managing boolean interactive prompts: `InteractiveMigrationQuestioner._boolean_input`.

Since I need to address the import order in migrations rather than just the interactive questioner handling, I will search for the code responsible for generating migration files. This will likely involve the Django makemigrations command implementation. 

I will search for the relevant methods and classes involved in generating migration files and handling their import order, focusing on the part of the codebase related to migration file generation logic.

```python
search_code_in_codebase("import datetime\nfrom django.db import migrations, models")
search_method_in_codebase("makemigrations")
search_method_in_codebase("write_migration_script")
search_class_in_codebase("MigrationWriter")
```

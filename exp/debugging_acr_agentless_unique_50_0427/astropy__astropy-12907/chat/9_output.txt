To determine if the issue is resolved, let's review the patch and analyze the test output before and after applying the patch.

### Patch Review

**Patch Details:**
- The patch modifies two assignments in the function within `astropy/modeling/separable.py`.

1. **First Edit**:
   - Changes `cleft[: left.shape[0], : left.shape[1]] = left` to `cleft[: left.shape[0], : left.shape[1]] = 1`
   - This change suggests that the `cleft` matrix is being initialized with ones in the leading segment, instead of copying from `left`.

2. **Second Edit**:
   - Changes `cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = 1` to `cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = right`
   - This edit implies replacing a constant one-fill with the actual `right` matrix values for the trailing segment of `cright`.

These changes indicate a focus on correctly handling the separability logic for nested models, where previously a constant matrix (all ones) or zeros might have hampered proper evaluation of separability.

### Test Output Analysis

**Original Test Output:**
- The test fails with an `AssertionError` because the computed separability matrix did not match the expected matrix.

**Patched Test Output:**
- "The issue is fixed. Exiting with code 0."
- The patched output suggests that the assertion passes, meaning the actual separability matrix now matches the expected matrix.

### Conclusion

Based on the patch review and the successful result of the test after applying the patch, it appears that the issue with computing the separability matrix for nested compound models has been addressed. The changes in the patch ensure that the separability properties are correctly reflected and evaluated, leading to the expected behavior as described in the issue.

Issue resolved: `True`

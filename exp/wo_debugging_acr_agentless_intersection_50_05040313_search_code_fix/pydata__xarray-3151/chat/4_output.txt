The patch attempted to address the issue by modifying the monotonic check for coordinates. The change allows for non-monotonic coordinates if all datasets have the same values for that dimension, which aligns with the expected behavior described in the issue.

**Review of the patch:**

1. **Adjustment of Conditions**:
   - The patch correctly adjusted the conditions to skip the monotonic check if all datasets have identical coordinates for the dimension.

2. **Use of `np.array_equal`**:
   - The patch introduced a check using `np.array_equal` to verify that the coordinates are identical across datasets.

3. **Import of `np`**:
   - The patch failed to include an import statement for `numpy` as `np`, which is why the patched output has a `NameError`.

**Test Output Analysis:**

- **Original Output**: The test raised a `ValueError` as expected, due to the non-monotonic coordinates.
- **Patched Output**: After applying the patch, the test failed with a `NameError` stating that 'np' is not defined, indicating a missing import statement for `numpy`.

**Conclusion:**

The root cause of the new error (`NameError: name 'np' is not defined`) is due to the missing import of `numpy`. The patch does move in the right direction to address the original `ValueError` issue by modifying conditions to accommodate identical non-monotonic coordinates, but the oversight in implementing the import statement for `numpy` means the patch does not function as intended.

Therefore, the issue is not fully resolved due to this error.

Issue resolved: `False`

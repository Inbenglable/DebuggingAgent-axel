Based on the code examination and problem analysis, the ZeroDivisionError occurs when there are no support vectors, leading to an empty `dual_coef_indices`. Therefore, we need to add a check to handle cases where there are zero support vectors before performing operations that assume the presence of support vectors.

Here's the patch to resolve the issue:

```pythony
### sklearn/svm/base.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        dual_coef_indices = np.tile(np.arange(n_SV), n_class)
        dual_coef_indptr = np.arange(0, dual_coef_indices.size + 1,
                                     dual_coef_indices.size / n_class)
        self.dual_coef_ = sp.csr_matrix(
            (dual_coef_data, dual_coef_indices, dual_coef_indptr),
            (n_class, n_SV))
=======
        if n_SV > 0:
            dual_coef_indices = np.tile(np.arange(n_SV), n_class)
            dual_coef_indptr = np.arange(0, dual_coef_indices.size + 1,
                                         dual_coef_indices.size / n_class)
            self.dual_coef_ = sp.csr_matrix(
                (dual_coef_data, dual_coef_indices, dual_coef_indptr),
                (n_class, n_SV))
        else:
            self.dual_coef_ = sp.csr_matrix((n_class, 0))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The patch introduces a check for `n_SV > 0` before executing the logic that leads to the ZeroDivisionError. If there are no support vectors, the `self.dual_coef_` is set to an empty sparse matrix, which handles the case without error while maintaining the expected usage.

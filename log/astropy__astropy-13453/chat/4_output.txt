Based on the issue described and the current trace, it seems that the problem with formats not being applied arises from how the write operation for HTML does not factor in the formats. The current trace shows the `UnifiedReadWriteMethod.__get__` correctly sets up the `TableWrite` instance, yet it does not indicate the specific handling issue with formats.

To identify the root cause, I need to investigate how the `TableWrite` instance handles the `formats` argument when writing HTML. Therefore, I will examine the method where the `formats` argument should be processed during the HTML write operation.

Observed scope: `astropy/table/connect.py:999-1020`  
This scope should include the implementation handling the `formats` argument during table writing, especially for HTML formatting. Let's proceed with observing this part.

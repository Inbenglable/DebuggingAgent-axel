To address the issue, the handling of non-dimensional coordinates should be adjusted to ensure they are not demoted to variables during the `construct` method. Let's create a patch to resolve this by ensuring the non-dimensional coordinates remain as such after constructing the dataset.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### xarray/core/rolling.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        should_be_coords = set(window_dim) & set(self.obj.coords)\n=======\n        should_be_coords = set(self.obj.coords)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This change ensures that all coordinates from the original object are preserved in the result, addressing the issue where non-dimensional coordinates were being demoted to variables.

I have located the Paginator class. Now, let's ensure we have the complete source code of the Paginator class to confidently add the `__iter__` method in the correct place. Currently, the search results show only the method names and some of the signatures, but no complete source code. I will retrieve the entire class definition.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/core/paginator.py", "Paginator")
```

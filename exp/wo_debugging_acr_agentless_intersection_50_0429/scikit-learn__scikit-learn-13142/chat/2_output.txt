Based on the issue description, it is evident that we need to focus on the `GaussianMixture` class's implementations of the `fit_predict` and `predict` methods.

Among the API returned contents for `fit_predict`, the following is relevant:

1. **sklearn/mixture/base.py:BaseMixture.fit_predict** - This is related to the GaussianMixture as it deals with mixture models and contains specific logic handling multiple initializations (`n_init`), which is precisely what the issue is about.

Let's proceed with the relevant result:

```
sklearn/mixture/base.py:BaseMixture.fit_predict
```

We need to examine this file to identify any discrepancies between the `fit_predict` and `predict` methods, particularly in handling multiple initializations (`n_init`).

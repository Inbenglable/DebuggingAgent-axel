To address the issue, we need to modify how the `_image()` function handles generators within `PermutationGroups`. The description points to the handling of inverted generators resulting in failing tests. Therefore, we should look into the `_image()` function's current implementation to understand what needs to be changed.

To proceed, we need to locate and review the `_image()` function within the `homomorphisms.py` file in the SymPy codebase. This will provide us with the context required to generate a suitable patch.

Since we know the file path from the information mentioned in the issue, I will search for the `_image()` method directly within the `sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py` file to examine its code.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py", "_image")
```

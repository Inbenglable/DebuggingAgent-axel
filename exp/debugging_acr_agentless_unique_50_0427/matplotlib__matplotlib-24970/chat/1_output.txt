The issue stems from the conversion of out-of-bound Python integers (values like 256, 257, and 258) to NumPy integer arrays with the dtype `np.uint8`. These conversions will cause deprecation warnings starting from NumPy version 1.24 because numpy is planning to stop allowing this kind of conversion.

The code snippet in question uses the colormap from Matplotlib, which internally makes these conversions, leading to deprecation warnings. The problematic part is likely in the handling of these values within Matplotlib's colormap logic, specifically in the `colors.py` file of Matplotlib as indicated by the stack trace.

Given the information, the potential issue lies in the handling of out-of-bounds values in the `matplotlib.colors` module in Matplotlib.

Now, proceed to observe the method in `matplotlib.colors` where the array `xa` is modified, as indicated by the following warnings:

1. `/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/matplotlib/colors.py:730`
2. `/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/matplotlib/colors.py:731`
3. `/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/matplotlib/colors.py:732`

I will trace into this module to observe the handling and modification logic there.

Observed method: `lib/matplotlib/colors.py:<method handling xa modification>`

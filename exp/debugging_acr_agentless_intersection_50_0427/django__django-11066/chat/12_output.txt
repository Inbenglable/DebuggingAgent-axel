To determine if the issue is fixed, let's analyze both the patch and the test outputs before and after the patch.

### Patch Analysis

The patch modifies the `content_type.save` method call in the `RenameContentType._rename()` method to include the `using` parameter:

Original Code:
```python
content_type.save(update_fields={'model'})
```

Patched Code:
```python
content_type.save(using=db, update_fields={'model'})
```

The patch correctly implements the suggested change from the issue description, which involves specifying the database to be used by adding the `using=db` argument to the `save()` method.

### Test Output Analysis

#### Original Output
The test fails with an `ImproperlyConfigured` error due to Django settings not being configured, specifically indicating that `INSTALLED_APPS` is not accessible:

```
django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: Requested setting INSTALLED_APPS, but settings are not configured. You must either define the environment variable DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE or call settings.configure() before accessing settings.
```

#### Patched Output
The patched output is identical to the original output:

```
django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: Requested setting INSTALLED_APPS, but settings are not configured. You must either define the environment variable DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE or call settings.configure() before accessing settings.
```

### Conclusion

The identical error in both cases (before and after applying the patch) indicates that the test environment is not correctly set up, as it is failing due to an unrelated configuration issue rather than the original bug the patch was supposed to address.

The patch itself appears correct based on the issue description, but we cannot verify its impact due to the improper configuration of the Django settings environment in the test.

Therefore, as the test environment issue prevents verification of the specific problem described in the issue, we cannot confirm that the issue related to saving to the wrong database has been resolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

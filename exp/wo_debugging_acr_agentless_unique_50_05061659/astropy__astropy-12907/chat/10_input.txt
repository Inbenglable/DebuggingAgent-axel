This is the bug issue, which is in the **astropy** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Modeling's `separability_matrix` does not compute separability correctly for nested CompoundModels
Consider the following model:

```python
from astropy.modeling import models as m
from astropy.modeling.separable import separability_matrix

cm = m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)
```

It's separability matrix as you might expect is a diagonal:

```python
>>> separability_matrix(cm)
array([[ True, False],
       [False,  True]])
```

If I make the model more complex:
```python
>>> separability_matrix(m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5))
array([[ True,  True, False, False],
       [ True,  True, False, False],
       [False, False,  True, False],
       [False, False, False,  True]])
```

The output matrix is again, as expected, the outputs and inputs to the linear models are separable and independent of each other.

If however, I nest these compound models:
```python
>>> separability_matrix(m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm)
array([[ True,  True, False, False],
       [ True,  True, False, False],
       [False, False,  True,  True],
       [False, False,  True,  True]])
```
Suddenly the inputs and outputs are no longer separable?

This feels like a bug to me, but I might be missing something?

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
## REPRODUCE TEST
```
import traceback
import sys
from astropy.modeling import models as m
from astropy.modeling.separable import separability_matrix

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Define the models
    cm = m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)
    nested_cm = m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm

    # Expected separability matrix for the nested compound model
    expected_matrix = [
        [True, True, False, False],
        [True, True, False, False],
        [False, False, True, False],
        [False, False, False, True]
    ]

    # Get the actual separability matrix
    actual_matrix = separability_matrix(nested_cm)

    # Check if the actual matrix matches the expected matrix
    try:
        assert (actual_matrix == expected_matrix).all(), "Separability matrix does not match the expected output."
        print("The issue is fixed. Exiting with code 0.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

And this is the original output when running the test (before applying the patch):
## ORIGINAL OUTPUT
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/astropy__astropy-12907/reproduce.py"
    34: assert (actual_matrix == expected_matrix).all(), "Separability matrix does not match the expected output."
AssertionError: Separability matrix does not match the expected output.

```

The repair agent has tried to generate a patch to fix the issue:
## PATCH CONTEXT
<PATCH_CONTEXT>
To address the issue of incorrect computation of separability for nested CompoundModels in the Astropy library, the solution involves modifying the `_separable` function so it correctly handles cases when combining models with the `&` operator. Here's the patch proposal to fix the identified bug:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### astropy/modeling/separable.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        return _operators[transform.op](sepleft, sepright)\n=======\n        if transform.op == '&':\n            return np.block([ [sepleft, np.zeros_like(sepright)], [np.zeros_like(sepleft), sepright] ])\n        else:\n            return _operators[transform.op](sepleft, sepright)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Change in `_separable` function**: 
  - By modifying the handling of the `&` operator, we should concatenate the matrices for left and right submodels in a block diagonal fashion using `np.block`. This ensures that the separability matrices reflect the independent nature of nested compound models correctly, preserving independence when inputs are combined with `&`. 

This change will maintain correct separability behavior when models are combined with other operations and keep the intended separability for complex, nested combinations too.

```
The issue is fixed. Exiting with code 0.

```

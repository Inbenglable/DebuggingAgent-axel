To address the issue, I need to inspect the `_multi_decorate` function because it is responsible for applying the decorator inside the `method_decorator`. This will help me understand why the `__name__` attribute and other expected function attributes are not being properly assigned.

Since I don't have the file path for `_multi_decorate`, I will search for it in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("_multi_decorate")
```

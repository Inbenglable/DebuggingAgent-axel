Currently, we are focusing on the `unparse` method in `sphinx/pycode/ast.py`. The function takes an AST node and attempts to unparse it into a string representation. We see that the method correctly identifies the nature of the node and delegates the unparsing task to the `_UnparseVisitor` with the `visit` method. The expected output `(1,)` is incorrectly returned as `(1)`, indicating a flaw in how the unparse logic handles single-element tuples.

Given that the misunderstanding occurs in the visit call path (as evidenced by the return value), the aberrant behavior must be located downstream in the process when `visit` on `_UnparseVisitor` is invoked. Therefore, we should examine the logic within `_UnparseVisitor` when processing nodes of type `Tuple`, which seems responsible for the erroneous conversion.

Next, we should trace within `_UnparseVisitor`'s methods that are pertinent to `Tuple` nodes. 

Observed scope: `sphinx/pycode/ast.py:_UnparseVisitor-visit`

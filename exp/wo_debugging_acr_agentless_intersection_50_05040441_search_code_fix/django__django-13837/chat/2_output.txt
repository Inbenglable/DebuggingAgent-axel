To resolve the issue, I need to modify the `get_child_arguments` function to utilize Python's documented way of determining if it was launched with the `-m` flag.

Since I have already obtained the source code for the `get_child_arguments` function in `django/utils/autoreload.py`, I'm ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

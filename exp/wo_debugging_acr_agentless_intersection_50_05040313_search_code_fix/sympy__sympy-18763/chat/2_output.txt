To address the issue of incorrect LaTeX parenthesizing of the `Subs` object, I need to locate the printing method responsible for LaTeX representation in the `sympy` codebase related to the `Subs` class.

Based on the search results, the `Subs` class is defined in `sympy/core/function.py`, and there is a `latex` function in `sympy/printing/latex.py`. It's likely that there's a specific method within the `LatexPrinter` class related to `Subs` printing.

To proceed, I will search for the `LatexPrinter` class and its method pertinent to `Subs`. This requires examining the source code to understand and apply the fix.

```python
search_class_in_file("sympy/printing/latex.py", "LatexPrinter")
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/latex.py", "Subs")
```

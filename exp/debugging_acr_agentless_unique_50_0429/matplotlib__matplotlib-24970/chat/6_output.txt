Based on the current information, I have gathered the necessary source code for the `Colormap.__call__` method, which is central to addressing the deprecation warning issue. This method processes colormap indices and will need adjustments to handle out-of-bound integer values correctly.

I now have enough information to generate a patch to resolve the issue.

Ready generation: `True`

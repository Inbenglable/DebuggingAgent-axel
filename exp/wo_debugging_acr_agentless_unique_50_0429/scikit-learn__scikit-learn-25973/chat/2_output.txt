To resolve the issue of passing the splits directly to the `SequentialFeatureSelector` class, we need to ensure that the class correctly handles an iterable of splits in its `fit` method. The error traceback indicates a problem in `_validation.py`, therefore, reviewing how cross-validation splits are processed in `SequentialFeatureSelector.fit` is essential to determine if the iterable is correctly supported.

Since we have already retrieved the `fit` method code for the `SequentialFeatureSelector`, our next step is to explore how the `cv` parameter is utilized or delegated within this method, or somewhere in `_validation.py` if needed, because iterable splits may be expected to follow a certain format or have specific handling.

I'll now retrieve relevant parts from `_validation.py` related to the error in handling the `cv` iterable.

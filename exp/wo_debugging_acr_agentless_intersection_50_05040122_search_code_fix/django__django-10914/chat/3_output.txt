I need to retrieve the source code for the `FileSystemStorage._save` method in the `django/core/files/storage.py` file to ensure that a default permission mode is being set when files are saved. Additionally, I want to check how the `file_permissions_mode` is being set within the method.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/files/storage.py", "FileSystemStorage._save")
search_method_in_file("django/core/files/storage.py", "FileSystemStorage.file_permissions_mode")
```

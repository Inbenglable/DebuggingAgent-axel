You need to trace the abnormal program to resolve project issues and submit pull requests.
Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **pytest** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
caplog fixture doesn't restore log level after test
From the documentation at https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.0.0/logging.html#caplog-fixture, "The log levels set are restored automatically at the end of the test".
It used to work, but looks broken in new 6.0 release. Minimal example to reproduce:

```
def test_foo(caplog):
    caplog.set_level(42)

def test_bar(caplog):
    print(caplog.handler.level)
```

It prints "0" for pytest<6, "42" after.

</ISSUE>


Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
import pytest

def test_foo(caplog):
    print(f"Initial handler level: {caplog.handler.level}")
    caplog.set_level(42)
    print(f"Handler level after set_level: {caplog.handler.level}")

def test_bar(caplog):
    print(f"Handler level in next test: {caplog.handler.level}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pytest.main([__file__, "-v"])


This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
Given the issue description and the provided test script, the problem appears to stem from the `caplog` fixture not restoring the log level after a test when it should. The test script behavior shows that the log level set in `test_foo` (42) is still present in `test_bar`, indicating the log level was not reset to its original state after `test_foo` was completed.

To address this defect, we need to analyze the behavior of the `caplog` fixture, particularly focusing on how it handles log level modifications and restoration at the end of each test function.

The test appears to indicate that the handling or wrap up after test execution is where the issue lies, which would most likely involve the context or cleanup around tests in the logging handler.

To trace further, we need to observe the method in the pytest codebase responsible for setting and restoring the log level, especially focusing on handler operations with `caplog`. Proceeding, I will observe potential methods involving hook functions or fixture tear-down mechanisms relevant to `caplog`.

Observed method: `src/_pytest/logging.py:LogCaptureFixture.set_level`
==================================================
The initial analysis of the `LogCaptureFixture.set_level` method shows that it sets the log level on line 436 with `logger_obj.setLevel(level)` and presumably restores the original log level later using the `self._initial_logger_levels` dictionary which stores the initial log level on line 435. However, the issue is that these levels aren't restored automatically at the end of the test, as indicated by the user's complaint.

The problem likely lies in how and when these stored initial levels are supposed to be used to reset the log level at the end of a test, which is usually handled in a tear-down or finalization method within the fixture lifecycle.

To identify the root cause, I need to observe the finalization logic of the `LogCaptureFixture` to ensure the log levels stored in `self._initial_logger_levels` are indeed restored. This involves tracing the teardown processes or any cleanup mechanisms related to the fixture, which are typically located in methods like `_finalize`.

To further investigate, I will observe the `_finalize` method, since this is logically connected with restoring states or performing cleanup. 

Observed scope: `src/_pytest/logging.py:120-160`
==================================================
The runtime information provided pertains to the `auto_indent_option`, which seems unrelated to the `caplog` fixture issue and log level restoration. The observed lines of code essentially deal with indentation logic, rather than with logging.

The issue lies in the fact that log levels are not restored after a test completes, and this code snippet does not address that aspect. We are interested in the procedures that involve handling logging fixtures, specifically focusing on the set and reset of log levels.

To further probe into the root of the problem, we need to find the portion of the code that manages the teardown or cleanup of a test using the `caplog` fixture, ensuring that the log levels are reverted correctly after each test. This process will likely be managed by a method in the `LogCaptureFixture` class.

The next logical step is to observe the `_finalize` method which appears pertinent to teardown procedures.

Observed method: `src/_pytest/logging.py:LogCaptureFixture._finalize`
==================================================
The `_finalize` method in the `LogCaptureFixture` class appears to be correctly implemented for restoring logger levels. This method iterates over the initial logger levels stored in `self._initial_logger_levels` and resets them back to their original state at the end of the test. This aligns with the expected behavior described in the documentation. 

However, from the issue description and the tests provided, it seems that the `_finalize` method is not being called as expected after each test, which leads to the log levels not being restored between tests.

The problem might be elsewhere in the lifecycle of test fixtures or in the initialization or integration of this fixture itself, where this `_finalize` method is perhaps not triggered at the correct time or under the correct conditions.

Given this deduction, the next logical step would be to observe how and when the `_finalize` method is invoked within the fixture lifecycle. This would involve understanding how fixture setup and teardown are managed in pytest, particularly for the `caplog` fixture. To trace this, I will need to examine the code responsible for managing fixture finalization.

Therefore, I will move upstream to see how fixtures are finalized, which could lead us to further insights on why `_finalize` isn't called properly.

Observed scope: `src/_pytest/logging.py:LogCaptureFixture.__init__` through any fixture lifecycle management methods. Let's observe:
```plaintext
Observed scope: src/_pytest/logging.py:300-350
```
==================================================
From the analysis and the runtime information, it's apparent that the issue is with the lifecycle management of the `caplog` fixture, specifically its failure to reset logger levels after a test. The `LogCaptureFixture._finalize` method appears to be correctly restoring logger levels, which implies it should be called as part of the exit routine for the fixture context.

The issue may lie in the fact that this finalization isn't being triggered correctly on test completion. This could be due to improper fixture teardown handling or context management within the pytest framework. 

Given this analysis, the problem seems rooted in the triggering and connection of this finalization method within the `caplog` fixture, potentially in the way teardown or fixture finalization is integrated.

To verify this hypothesis and pinpoint the root cause, we should observe the lifecycle management of fixtures, particularly looking for potential gaps in teardown procedures that might prevent `_finalize` from executing as expected.

Therefore, the next step is to trace further up into fixture lifecycle handling to ascertain if `_finalize` is invoked correctly. Observing how the `caplog` fixture is managed and finalized seems like a logical progression.

Observed method: `src/_pytest/logging.py:LogCaptureFixture.__enter__` (to inspect how resources/handlers are acquired and should lead to corresponding teardown).
==================================================


Now you choose downstream method catching_logs.__enter__ to further observe, tracing the abnormal program behavior.
This is the method code:
   296	    def __enter__(self):
   297	        root_logger = logging.getLogger()
   298	        if self.level is not None:
   299	            self.handler.setLevel(self.level)
   300	        root_logger.addHandler(self.handler)
   301	        if self.level is not None:
   302	            self.orig_level = root_logger.level
   303	            root_logger.setLevel(min(self.orig_level, self.level))
   304	        return self.handler


This is the runtime information of catching_logs.__enter__:

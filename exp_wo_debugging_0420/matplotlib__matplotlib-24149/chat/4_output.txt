The issue seems to be related to the handling of all-NaN inputs in the `Axes.bar` method, specifically when trying to find the first non-NaN value using `_safe_first_finite`. The function `_safe_first_finite` seems to be raising an error when there are no finite numbers to be found, which is why the `StopIteration` exception is occurring.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `_safe_first_finite` doesn't raise `StopIteration` when no finite numbers are present and instead handle it gracefully.

Given that I have the source code for the `Axes.bar` method and the `_safe_first_finite` function, I'm ready to generate the patch for the fix.

Ready generation: `True`

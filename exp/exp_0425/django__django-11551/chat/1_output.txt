The test script is attempting to configure Django settings and set up the Django environment, which includes populating the installed apps. However, during this process, it encounters a `ModuleNotFoundError` because it cannot find the `test_app` module, which is expected to exist as part of the Django app configuration.

The error specifically occurs during the call to `django.setup()`, which is responsible for initializing the Django application registry using the list of installed apps specified in the settings.

This indicates that none of the actual checks relevant to the reported issue are being executed because the test environment setup itself fails.

To resolve this, we need to ensure that the test application, `test_app`, and its relevant models and admin configurations are correctly defined and available in the test environment.

Since the code in the original issue is primarily related to a bug within the `_check_list_display_item` validation within Django's admin checks, I'll focus on the method where the issue in the admin validation might be originating:

Observed method: `django/contrib/admin/checks.py:_check_list_display_item`

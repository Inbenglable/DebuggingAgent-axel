The issue at hand occurs because `ManagementUtility` is expecting `argv[0]` to hold a valid program name that `os.path.basename` can process. However, in the test scenario, `argv[0]` is set to `None`, which results in a `TypeError`. Since the problem arises when `os.path.basename` is called with `None`, the root cause is at this particular line in the `__init__` method of `ManagementUtility`.

The bug is triggered when the `argv` passed to `ManagementUtility` has `argv[0]` as `None`, not being properly processed by the `__init__` method. The correct fix is to handle `None` as a potential value for `argv[0]` and correct it accordingly.

Based on the provided information and the analysis:

Buggy method: `django/core/management/__init__.py:ManagementUtility.__init__`

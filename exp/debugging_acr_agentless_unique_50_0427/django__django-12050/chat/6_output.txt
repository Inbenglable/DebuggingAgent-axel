Given the information at hand, I need to retrieve the source code for the `resolve_lookup_value` method in the `Query` class within the file `django/db/models/sql/query.py` to fully understand its current implementation and generate the necessary patch.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/sql/query.py", "Query.resolve_lookup_value")
```

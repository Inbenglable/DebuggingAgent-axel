## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Use subprocess.run and PGPASSWORD for client in postgres backend
Description
	
â€‹subprocess.run was added in python 3.5 (which is the minimum version since Django 2.1). This function allows you to pass a custom environment for the subprocess.
Using this in django.db.backends.postgres.client to set PGPASSWORD simplifies the code and makes it more reliable.

In the previous round, you called search APIs to retrieve relevant source code that would help identify the root cause of the issue and generate a patch. However, the code you retrieved appears in multiple locations (maybe some are irrelevant but have same key). So now your task is to determine which of the retrieved contents are indeed you need, and filter out the irrelevant ones.
This is your API invocation round output:
Since the initial attempts to locate the `client` method within Django's PostgreSQL backend have yielded no relevant results, I need to search for the method again, possibly within a different scope or by considering specific class context. Given my understanding, we should be searching within the Django PostgreSQL backend files.

Let's try locating the `client` method within the context of the `PostgreSQLDatabaseWrapper` class, which is a more specific and likely location of where the command execution is handled.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("PostgreSQLDatabaseWrapper.client")
search_class_in_codebase("DatabaseClient")
```

And this is the corresponding API returned result (each content is started with #### FILE_PATH:NAME):
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("PostgreSQLDatabaseWrapper.client")
RESULT:
#### tests/template_tests/views.py:client
```python
def client(request, id):
    pass

```

#### django/utils/autoreload.py:WatchmanReloader.client
```python
    def client(self):
        return pywatchman.client()

```



Among the API returned contents, there may be some irrelevant ones or not. So now you need to analyze each returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.
Now, please first analyze the API returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.

Then you need to choose you needed ones with the following format:
```
FILE_PATH_1:NAME_1
FILE_PATH_2:NAME_2
...
```

Note:
1. The value of FILE_PATH:NAME, must consistent with the API returned content (but remove the prefix ####).
2. You may select one or more contents, or even all of them if they are indeed you need.

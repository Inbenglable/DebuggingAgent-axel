To resolve the issue of adding DISTINCT support for Avg and Sum aggregates in a Django project, I need to investigate how the existing aggregates handle the DISTINCT parameter. I must first locate and review the code for Avg and Sum aggregates, typically found in the aggregation modules of Django's ORM.

I will start by searching for the class definitions of Avg and Sum, likely found in the `django.db.models` module under its aggregation submodules. This module deals with database operations including aggregations.

Let's begin by searching for these class definitions to understand how they currently process or handle any DISTINCT flags.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Avg")
search_class_in_codebase("Sum")
```

Based on the analysis and runtime information provided, the assertion error observed is not directly related to the behavior of the `-v` (short verbose) option, but rather an issue with the test setup not finding a file or path. This means our focus should continue to be on understanding how `optdict` for the `-v` option might incorrectly be configured to `store` instead of `store_true`.

### Current Understanding:
- The `_convert_option_to_argument` function creates argument class instances depending on configurations in `optdict`.
- The problematic behavior of expecting an argument for `-v` suggests that within `optdict`, `-v` might be initialized with an incorrect `action`.

### Next Steps:
Trace back the setup and initialization of `optdict` and its assignment of attributes for `-v`, especially focusing on whether the expected action is mistakenly set to `store`.

Thus, the next logical step is to observe where `optdict` is configured or populated, specifically focusing on the details for the verbose option. This involves tracing back through modules and methods responsible for the initial setup of this dictionary.

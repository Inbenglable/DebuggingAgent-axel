To implement the `--skip-checks` option, I need to modify the `BaseCommand.add_arguments` method to integrate this user-facing option. Additionally, since the option relates to the handling and execution of the command, it might also involve changes in the `execute()` and `_run_checks()` methods, as they are likely related to the option `requires_system_checks`. Let's retrieve these methods to understand better how to handle the `--skip-checks` flag within their contexts.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/management/base.py", "BaseCommand.execute")
search_method_in_file("django/core/management/base.py", "BaseCommand._run_checks")
```

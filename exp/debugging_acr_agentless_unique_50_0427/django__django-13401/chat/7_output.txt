To resolve the issue where Django model fields are incorrectly considered equal across models, we need to modify the `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods in the `Field` class. The adjustment should include consideration of the `field.model` along with the `creation_counter`. Here are the `SEARCH/REPLACE` format patches:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        # Needed for @total_ordering\n        if isinstance(other, Field):\n            return self.creation_counter == other.creation_counter\n        return NotImplemented\n=======\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        # Needed for @total_ordering\n        if isinstance(other, Field):\n            return (self.creation_counter == other.creation_counter) and (self.model == other.model)\n        return NotImplemented\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    def __hash__(self):\n        return hash(self.creation_counter)\n=======\n    def __hash__(self):\n        return hash((self.creation_counter, self.model))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    def __lt__(self, other):\n        # This is needed because bisect does not take a comparison function.\n        if isinstance(other, Field):\n            return self.creation_counter < other.creation_counter\n        return NotImplemented\n=======\n    def __lt__(self, other):\n        # This is needed because bisect does not take a comparison function.\n        if isinstance(other, Field):\n            if self.creation_counter == other.creation_counter:\n                return self.model < other.model\n            return self.creation_counter < other.creation_counter\n        return NotImplemented\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

These changes ensure that equality, hash, and comparison operations also consider the model associated with a field, preventing incorrect field comparisons across models.

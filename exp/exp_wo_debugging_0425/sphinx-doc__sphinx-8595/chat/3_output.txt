To address the issue, I need to understand how the `__all__` attribute is handled in Sphinx, especially in the context of autodoc and the `automodule` directive. While I've gathered information about certain methods like `get_module_members`, there's still a missing piece related to how exactly the `__all__` attribute influences which members are documented.

The specific handling of the `__all__` attribute might be in the class or method that deals with module-level documentation. Therefore, I need to locate the relevant class or method that processes a module in `autodoc`.

I will start by examining the `ModuleDocumenter` class as it seems relevant given its addition during setup. Also, it is the likely candidate to handle the module member documentation process in Sphinx autodoc.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ModuleDocumenter")
```

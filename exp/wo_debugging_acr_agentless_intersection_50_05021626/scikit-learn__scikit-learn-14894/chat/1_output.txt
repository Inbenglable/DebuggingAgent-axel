We need to inspect the `_sparse_fit` method in the scikit-learn codebase to understand where the ZeroDivisionError occurs and how we can prevent it when the `support_vectors_` attribute is empty. 

Since we don't have the file path for the `_sparse_fit` method, we'll search for it in the whole codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("_sparse_fit")
```

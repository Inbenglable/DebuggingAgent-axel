To address the reported issue with the migration optimizer, specifically focusing on how it processes multiple `AlterField` operations, we need to identify where the method responsible for optimizing these operations is implemented. Typically, such functionality would be tied to a class or method responsible for optimizing or reducing migration operations.

It seems likely that there is a method related to optimizing or reducing `AlterField` operations within Django's migration system. Therefore, we should specifically look for methods or classes responsible for migration operation optimization and verify if an enhancement is required to reduce `AlterField` operations. 

Let's start by searching for the class and methods targeting migration optimization processes. We'll particularly want to find where the `AlterField` operation reduction might occur.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("optimize")
search_class_in_codebase("MigrationOptimizer")
search_class_in_codebase("AlterField")
```

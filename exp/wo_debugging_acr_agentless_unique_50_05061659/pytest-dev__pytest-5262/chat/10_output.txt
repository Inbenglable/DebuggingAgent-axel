To determine whether the issue is resolved, let's analyze the patch and the test outputs.

### Patch Analysis:
The proposed patch modifies the `__getattr__` method in `src/_pytest/capture.py`. Specifically, it changes the way the `mode` attribute is returned. The patch removes the character `'b'` from the `mode` attribute, addressing the specific issue where `_pytest.capture.EncodedFile` incorrectly advertised the mode as binary.

### Test Output Analysis:
1. **Original Output**:
   - The original test output shows a `ModuleNotFoundError`, indicating that the `youtube_dl` module is not installed. This error does not allow for testing of the functionality affected by the patch and does not directly relate to the original issue described (regarding the `mode` attribute).

2. **Patched Output**:
   - The patched test output is identical to the original, displaying the same `ModuleNotFoundError`. This suggests that the test environment is not set up correctly to reproduce the issue since it lacks the required `youtube_dl` package. Therefore, no conclusion can be drawn regarding the success or failure of the patch based purely on these test results.

### Conclusion:
Although the patch seems to address the issue described in the original problem statement by altering the `mode` attribute, the test outputs provided do not include a successful setup to verify this. The tests themselves are unable to run due to a missing module, meaning they do not test the actual functionality related to the issue.

To determine if the issue is truly resolved, it would be necessary to ensure the `youtube_dl` module is installed in the test environment and to verify that the modified functionality works as expected without triggering the exception originally described.

Issue resolved: `False`

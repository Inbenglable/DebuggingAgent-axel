Analyzing the issue presented in the code execution:

1. The core problem is that when using `mathematica_code(Max(x, 2))`, the output `Max(2, x)` is incorrectly formatted for valid Mathematica syntax; the expected output is `Max[x,2]`.

2. The traceback shows that the `mathematica_code` function is called, and within this function, `MCodePrinter(settings).doprint(expr)` is responsible for generating the incorrect code. 

3. As the issue lies in how the symbols are being printed (i.e., using parentheses instead of square brackets which are standard for Mathematica), the problem is likely with the printing method used within SymPy to format expressions. This incorrect formatting may occur due to the order of arguments or the use of incorrect brackets.

Given these observations, the focus should be on how expressions are being printed within the `mathematica_code` functionality in SymPy, which leads us to the printing mechanism.

Therefore, the next logical step is to observe the method that handles the printing of expressions.

Observed method: `sympy/printing/mathematica.py:MCodePrinter.doprint`

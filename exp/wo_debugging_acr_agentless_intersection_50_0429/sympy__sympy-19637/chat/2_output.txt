The issue arises because the variable `kern` is referenced in the `kernS` function before assignment when `quoted` is True or when there are no parentheses in `s`.

To resolve this issue, we should ensure that `kern` is defined before it is referenced. `kern` is currently defined inside an `if` block, and its definition should be moved outside or set to a default value prior to its use.

I've gathered enough information from the source code of the `kernS` method to generate a patch for this issue.

Ready generation: `True`

The issue at hand is with the unparsing of a 1-element tuple. The expected output of unparsing the string `"(1,)"` should be `"(1,)"`, but the current implementation incorrectly returns `"(1)"`, which lacks the trailing comma. Based on the debugging test results, the issue lies within the `unparse` function in the file `sphinx/pycode/ast.py`. According to the trace, the final output incorrectness arises after calling the `unparse` method.

Therefore, the current observation should focus on the `unparse` method.

Observed method: `sphinx/pycode/ast.py:unparse`

To resolve the issue, I first need to understand the implementation of the `_image` and `_check_homomorphism` functions and potentially any other relevant surrounding code. Since the issue arises in the `_image` function, it's crucial to start by examining the source code of that function and any interaction it has with permutation groups.

I'll retrieve the source code for the `_image` method, likely within a relevant class or module, by using the available search APIs to find its location and context within the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("_image")
search_method_in_codebase("_check_homomorphism")
```

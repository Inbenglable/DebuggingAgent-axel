You need to trace the abnormal program to resolve project issues and submit pull requests.
Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Add transaction handling to Changelist list_editable processing.
Description
	
It seems that changelist_view in Django admin is missing a transaction. Since the view may change data in database, it should be wrapped in a transaction to prevent unexpected states in case of errors.

This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
Analyzing the provided information, the main issue is an improper configuration of Django settings. The exception `django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured` indicates that Django settings are not set up correctly. Specifically, the error message "Requested setting INSTALLED_APPS, but settings are not configured" points out that the environment variable `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` has not been defined, or the settings have not been configured before accessing models, resulting in issues when importing Django modules.

The root cause lies in the setup of the Django environment in the test script. The setup is performed in the following lines of the script:

```python
# Set up Django environment
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'myproject.settings')  # Adjust the settings module according to your project
import django
django.setup()
```

The error indicates that either the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is not correctly set to the appropriate settings for the Django project or the settings module does not exist.

To trace further within the Django configuration, the method where the exception is thrown involves accessing apps that rely on the `INSTALLED_APPS` listâ€”this functionality is encapsulated within the Django app registry.

Observed method: `django/apps/registry.py:check_apps_ready`
==================================================
Analyzing the provided runtime information, the main issue arises from the improper configuration of Django settings before attempting to access models. The exception thrown is `django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured`, indicating that the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting is being accessed without the Django environment being properly set up.

The method `Apps.check_apps_ready()` checks if the Django apps have been imported, which requires the settings to be configured. The key line leading to the issue is:

- Line 137 in `django/apps/registry.py`: `settings.INSTALLED_APPS`

It attempts to access `INSTALLED_APPS`, causing an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception because the settings have not been set up yet. The root cause seems to be that the test script is not correctly setting up the Django environment before models are being accessed.

In the reproduced runtime information, the improper setup starts with the import statement:

```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
```

without prior setup of Django settings. Before proceeding with deeper analysis, the setup environment line in the test script should ensure it correctly configures Django settings before any imports that rely on these settings.

As of now, the scope contains both code logic and setup issues, so it's not fully conclusive to pinpoint the exact method causing the bug until the environment is correctly set up. 

To further trace the underlying code, I would need to inspect the initial setup and interaction with Django's configuration. Therefore, I will choose to observe the following scope within the test setup:

Observed scope: `django/conf/__init__.py:72-92`

This scope will provide insight into how settings are resolved internally, which is crucial for tracking down potential misconfigurations leading to the exception.
==================================================
The issue you're encountering is due to the Django settings not being properly configured before accessing the models. The trace clearly indicates that the error `django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured` is raised when attempting to access `settings.INSTALLED_APPS`. This occurs because the environment variable `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is not set or misconfigured.

To address the issue, it's crucial to ensure that the Django settings are properly set up before importing Django-specific parts like `models`. The observed traceback and analysis suggest that the setup environment line might be incorrectly placed or misconfigured.

### Current Observations:
1. The environment variable `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is not set, resulting in `settings_module` being `None`.
2. The error is triggered in `LazySettings.__getattr__` when it tries to access `INSTALLED_APPS` without proper settings.
3. The script attempts to import Django models before configuring the settings.

### Next Steps:
To properly diagnose and resolve the issue, we need to ascertain how and where the settings are being assessed and ensure configurations occur prior to any Django imports.

Observed method: `django/conf/__init__.py:Settings._setup`

This method is responsible for setting up the settings environment, making it crucial in diagnosing why and where the settings configuration is failing. Observing this should illuminate the correct setup process or point out any implicit missteps in the current configuration.
==================================================
The issue at hand is due to the Django settings not being properly set up, which leads to a `django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured` error. The traceback indicates that the settings are not configured when trying to access `INSTALLED_APPS`. This occurs because the environment variable `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is not set or misconfigured when the script attempts to import Django modules.

### Analysis of the Current Observed Code

The method `LazySettings._setup` is trying to load the settings module indicated by the environment variable `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`. Here are the key points of the method:

- It attempts to get the `settings_module` from the environment variable `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`.
- If `settings_module` is not found, it raises an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception, indicating that settings need to be properly configured by defining the environment variable or by using `settings.configure()` before accessing settings.

In the current scenario, `settings_module` is `None`, which means the environment variable `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is not correctly set at the time of importing models. This results in the lazy settings attempting to access configuration settings prematurely, leading to the error.

### Conclusion

As observed, the improper configuration or absence of the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable leads to the raised exception. The next step is to locate and fix the setup of the Django environment within the script before any model imports occur.

To accurately pinpoint the location contributing to this misconfiguration, I need to trace further back in the execution chain to any missteps prior to the `_setup` method call.

### Next Steps

I will investigate further into the initial setup and configuration of the Django environment that should occur before model imports. This will help locate where the environment variable is not being set correctly. Thus, I need to observe the environment setup and variable declaration in the test script or initial setup phase of the Django project.

Observed scope: `django/conf/__init__.py:50-60`

I will observe code within this range to understand how configuration initialization is intended to occur at the start of using Django settings and trace where it might go wrong.
==================================================
The runtime information from `LazySettings._setup` confirms the issue is related to the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable not being set before importing Django models. The error message, "Requested setting INSTALLED_APPS, but settings are not configured," indicates that Django tries to access the settings before they are configured.

### Analysis Summary:

- **Current Issue:** The `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable is not set when the script tries to import Django models. This causes the `LazySettings._setup()` method to raise an `ImproperlyConfigured` error because it can't find the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting.
- **Environment Setup:** The setup of the Django environment should happen before accessing Django models/components that depend on these settings.

### Steps Taken:
1. Code execution attempts to import `User` from `django.contrib.auth.models` before setting up the Django environment.
2. This triggers a cascade where Django attempts to configure apps, accessing `INSTALLED_APPS` prematurely.
3. The error arises from `LazySettings._setup()` within the Django configuration utility.

The observations indicate that the issue is concerning the environment's setup rather than a logic error within `LazySettings._setup()` itself. 

### Next Steps:
To address the root cause, I need to identify where the setup of the Django environment might be failing or incorrectly placed.

**Next Method to Observe:**
I will trace back to where the Django setup should occur in the test script or during initialization. Therefore, the initialization or import process in the test script should be observed.

Observed method: `django/__init__.py:django.setup`
==================================================


Now you choose downstream method setup to further observe, tracing the abnormal program behavior.
This is the method code:
     8	def setup(set_prefix=True):
     9	    """
    10	    Configure the settings (this happens as a side effect of accessing the
    11	    first setting), configure logging and populate the app registry.
    12	    Set the thread-local urlresolvers script prefix if `set_prefix` is True.
    13	    """
    14	    from django.apps import apps
    15	    from django.conf import settings
    16	    from django.urls import set_script_prefix
    17	    from django.utils.log import configure_logging
    18	
    19	    configure_logging(settings.LOGGING_CONFIG, settings.LOGGING)
    20	    if set_prefix:
    21	        set_script_prefix(
    22	            "/" if settings.FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME is None else settings.FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME
    23	        )
    24	    apps.populate(settings.INSTALLED_APPS)


This is the runtime information of setup:

Error occurred during script execution:Requested setting INSTALLED_APPS, but settings are not configured. You must either define the environment variable DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE or call settings.configure() before accessing settings.

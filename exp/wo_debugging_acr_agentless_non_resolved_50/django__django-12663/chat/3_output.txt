The issue arises because the `SimpleLazyObject` doesn't automatically get evaluated when used in the context of filter conditions. Based on the retrieved code, the main area of interest is the `Lookup.__init__` method which handles the `lhs` and `rhs` values in query filters. The `rhs` value (which is the `SimpleLazyObject` in this scenario) needs to be evaluated before it's used.

I need to confirm the handling and evaluation of `SimpleLazyObject` within the method `Lookup.__init__`. To effectively patch the issue, I'll need the complete source code for this method to ensure precise modifications.

Let's retrieve the source code of the `Lookup.__init__` method.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/lookups.py", "Lookup.__init__")
```

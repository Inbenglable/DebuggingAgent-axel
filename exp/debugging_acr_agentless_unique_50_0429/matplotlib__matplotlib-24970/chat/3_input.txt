[Bug]: NumPy 1.24 deprecation warnings
### Bug summary

Starting NumPy 1.24 I observe several deprecation warnings.


### Code for reproduction

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

plt.get_cmap()(np.empty((0, ), dtype=np.uint8))
```


### Actual outcome

```
/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/matplotlib/colors.py:730: DeprecationWarning: NumPy will stop allowing conversion of out-of-bound Python integers to integer arrays.  The conversion of 257 to uint8 will fail in the future.
For the old behavior, usually:
    np.array(value).astype(dtype)`
will give the desired result (the cast overflows).
  xa[xa > self.N - 1] = self._i_over
/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/matplotlib/colors.py:731: DeprecationWarning: NumPy will stop allowing conversion of out-of-bound Python integers to integer arrays.  The conversion of 256 to uint8 will fail in the future.
For the old behavior, usually:
    np.array(value).astype(dtype)`
will give the desired result (the cast overflows).
  xa[xa < 0] = self._i_under
/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/matplotlib/colors.py:732: DeprecationWarning: NumPy will stop allowing conversion of out-of-bound Python integers to integer arrays.  The conversion of 258 to uint8 will fail in the future.
For the old behavior, usually:

    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Convert warnings to exceptions
    warnings.simplefilter('error', DeprecationWarning)
    
    try:
        # Code to reproduce the issue
        cmap = plt.get_cmap()
        cmap(np.array([256, 257, 258], dtype=np.uint8))
        # If no warnings are raised, the issue is fixed
        print("No deprecation warnings observed. The issue is fixed.")
    except DeprecationWarning as e:
        # If a deprecation warning is raised, print the stack trace and raise an AssertionError
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Deprecation warnings were observed. The issue is present.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()


This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
The deprecation warnings observed are due to NumPy's plan to disallow the conversion of out-of-bound Python integers to integer arrays. The warnings indicate that the existing code in `matplotlib` might be using integer values that exceed the limits for a given `dtype` (in this case, `uint8`), which may cause an overflow in future versions of NumPy.

From the traceback and deprecation warnings, the issue appears to occur in the color mapping logic of `matplotlib`, specifically in how it handles indices for mappings. The warnings point to the lines in `matplotlib/colors.py`:

```python
xa[xa > self.N - 1] = self._i_over
xa[xa < 0] = self._i_under
xa[mask_bad] = self._i_bad
```

These lines are responsible for setting certain indices to special values meant for "over", "under", and "bad" values in a colormap. The deprecated behavior in NumPy allows for overflow when setting these indices, which `matplotlib` seems to be inherently relying upon in these assignments.

Given this information, the next logical step is to examine the method in the `matplotlib.colors` module responsible for this operation to identify how indices are determined and set.

Observed method: `lib/matplotlib/colors.py:_Colormap.__call__`
==================================================
Based on the current analysis, we can observe that the `DeprecationWarning` specifically points out issues related to handling out-of-bound values within `uint8` arrays. The observed trace indicates that this issue is propagating through `matplotlib.colors.Colormap.__call__`, and further into the `matplotlib.colors.NoNorm.__call__`.

### Current Understanding:

- The `DeprecationWarning` is raised when values 256, 257, and 258 are processed by `cmap(np.array([256, 257, 258], dtype=np.uint8))`.
- These values exceed the range for `uint8` (which is 0-255), resulting in the execution of lines in `matplotlib/colors.py` such as `xa[xa > self.N - 1] = self._i_over`.

### Next Steps:

To trace the execution in `matplotlib/colors.py` further, I need to analyze the scope where those specific lines are contributing to the sharing or transformation of these values. The warning references specific lines responsible for this out-of-bound conversion. We should first inspect deeper into the method responsible for setting these indices to examine how `xa` is processed and handed off to this logic. 

### Further Scope to Observe:

To find the precise processing of `xa` within the `Colormap.__call__` method, I will observe within the following scope:

Observed scope: `lib/matplotlib/colors.py:700-740` 

This should provide insights into how these operations are being handled, particularly the interactions surrounding `xa > self.N - 1`, `xa < 0`, and `mask_bad`. Once this is understood, we should be able to determine the necessary changes to fix the depreciation warnings with future NumPy versions.

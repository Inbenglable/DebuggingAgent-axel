To resolve the issue where `Dagger(A) * IdentityOperator()` does not simplify to `Dagger(A)`, we need to modify the `__mul__` method of the `IdentityOperator` class to include handling for instances of `Dagger`. This involves checking if the `other` operand is a `Dagger` type and returning it directly upon multiplication, similar to how we handle `Operator`.

Here's the patch:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/physics/quantum/operator.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if isinstance(other, Operator):\n=======\n        if isinstance(other, (Operator, Dagger)):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch modifies the multiplication logic to ensure that if `other` is a `Dagger` object, the result will be simplified to return `other` directly.

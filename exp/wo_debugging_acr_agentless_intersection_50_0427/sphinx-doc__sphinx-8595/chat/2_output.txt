To address this issue, it's crucial to inspect the `get_object_members` and `filter_members` methods within the `Documenter` class, as these methods are likely involved in determining which members of a module are documented. Particularly, `get_object_members` deals with fetching members, potentially considering `__all__`, and `filter_members` could influence which fetched members are eventually included in the documentation.

Since the `Documenter` class is located in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`, I'll retrieve the source code for these methods.

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py", "Documenter.get_object_members")
search_method_in_file("sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py", "Documenter.filter_members")
```

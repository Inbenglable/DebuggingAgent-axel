You need to trace the abnormal program to resolve project issues and submit pull requests.
Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
timesince() raises TypeError with USE_TZ=True and >1 month interval.
Description
	 
		(last modified by Sage Abdullah)
	 
As of 8d67e16493c903adc9d049141028bc0fff43f8c8, calling timesince() with a datetime object that's one month (or more) in the past and the USE_TZ setting is set to True results in the following crash:
TypeError: can't subtract offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes
Test:
...
class TimesinceTests(TestCase):
	...
	@requires_tz_support
	@override_settings(USE_TZ=True)
	def test_long_interval_with_tz(self):
		now = timezone.now()
		d = now - datetime.timedelta(days=31)
		self.assertEqual(timesince(d), "1\xa0month")
I believe this is because the pivot instantiated here: â€‹https://github.com/django/django/blob/d2310f6473593d28c14b63a72253408b568e100a/django/utils/timesince.py#L93-L100 does not take into account the datetime object's tzinfo. Adding 0, d.tzinfo arguments to the datetime.datetime call seems to fix this.
Happy to send a PR.

This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
To analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior, let's examine the situation:

1. **Issue Overview:**
   - The issue occurs when calling `timesince()` with a datetime object more than one month old when `USE_TZ` is set to `True`. The error message indicates a `TypeError` related to subtracting naive and aware datetime objects.

2. **Test Case:**
   - The test case `test_long_interval_with_tz` replicates the problem. It uses Django's `timezone.now()` to get the current time and subtracts 31 days from it, effectively making `d` a timezone-aware datetime. Then it invokes `timesince(d)`.

3. **Error Explanation:**
   - The error arises due to a mismatch between offset-naive and offset-aware datetime objects. This is likely due to an oversight in handling timezone information in the method `timesince()` within the `timesince.py` file referred to in the issue description.

4. **Runtime Error:**
   - The provided stack trace and error message in the current test run point out a `NameError` indicating that the `sys` module was not defined, which is separate from the issue with `timesince()`. This error is related to the test setup and is not directly related to the actual bug in the Django `timesince()` function.

Given this analysis, the main focus would be on the `timesince()` function in `django/utils/timesince.py`. Specifically, we want to check how the function handles timezone information for datetime objects and ensure it properly accounts for timezone differences.

Therefore, the next step in tracing would be to observe the method implementation that might cause this issue. We need to verify the handling of timezone-aware and naive datetime comparisons.

Observed method: `django/utils/timesince.py:timesince`
==================================================


Now you choose downstream method timesince to further observe, tracing the abnormal program behavior.
This is the method code:
    28	def timesince(d, now=None, reversed=False, time_strings=None, depth=2):
    29	    """
    30	    Take two datetime objects and return the time between d and now as a nicely
    31	    formatted string, e.g. "10 minutes". If d occurs after now, return
    32	    "0 minutes".
    33	
    34	    Units used are years, months, weeks, days, hours, and minutes.
    35	    Seconds and microseconds are ignored.
    36	
    37	    The algorithm takes into account the varying duration of years and months.
    38	    There is exactly "1 year, 1 month" between 2013/02/10 and 2014/03/10,
    39	    but also between 2007/08/10 and 2008/09/10 despite the delta being 393 days
    40	    in the former case and 397 in the latter.
    41	
    42	    Up to `depth` adjacent units will be displayed.  For example,
    43	    "2 weeks, 3 days" and "1 year, 3 months" are possible outputs, but
    44	    "2 weeks, 3 hours" and "1 year, 5 days" are not.
    45	
    46	    `time_strings` is an optional dict of strings to replace the default
    47	    TIME_STRINGS dict.
    48	
    49	    `depth` is an optional integer to control the number of adjacent time
    50	    units returned.

Based on the given information, it appears we have enough context to generate the patch for the issue. The error occurs because the opts assignment is targeting the proxy model's `_meta` instead of the concrete model's `_meta`. Since the proposed solution was to replace `cur_model._meta` with `cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta`, I should proceed with the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

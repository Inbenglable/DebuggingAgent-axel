To resolve the issue, I need to review the source code of the `post_process` method in the `ManifestFilesMixin` class located in `django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py`. This will help me understand how the `substitutions` variable is handled and where the initialization and condition checks occur, which currently cause the `UnboundLocalError` when `max_post_process_passes` is set to 0.

I will retrieve the source code for the `ManifestFilesMixin.post_process` method.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py", "ManifestFilesMixin.post_process")
```

Based on the issue prompt and the API invocation results, we need to identify the relevant source code for handling LaTeX printing specifically for the `Subs` class. The initial search attempt for `Subs._latex` did not return anything relevant to the `Subs` class directly. Instead, it returned methods from various files, none of which appear to relate directly to the `Subs` class.

Now analyzing the output obtained from the search for `_print_Subs`, none of the returned results match `_print_Subs`:

Given that the searches likely focused on different packages that don't involve `Subs`, instead return other classes' `_latex` methods, it's evident these results are not directly relevant to our task of resolving the `Subs` printing issue.

Thus, none of the contents provided from this API invocation are needed:

No content selected from search_method_in_codebase("Subs._latex") results.

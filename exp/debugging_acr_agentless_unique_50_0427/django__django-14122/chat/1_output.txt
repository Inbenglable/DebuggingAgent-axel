To better understand the issues and locate the source of the problem, it's essential to delve into the execution process related to the `GROUP BY` clause caused by `Meta.ordering`. Given the current error statement and issue description, it's possible that the problem lies within Django's ORM handling of SQL queries when aggregation and `ordering` are combined.

Observing the query generation methods related to ORM's SQL compilation may highlight how `Meta.ordering` fields are mistakenly included in the GROUP BY clause. Therefore, I will examine relevant methods related to query compilation.

Observed method: `django/db/models/sql/query.py:add_ordering`

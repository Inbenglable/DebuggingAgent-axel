In order to resolve the issue, I need to examine the implementation of the `autodoc` feature in Sphinx, specifically how it handles the `__all__` attribute. This likely involves methods related to member filtering and documentation generation.

Here's what I need to investigate:

1. Identify how Sphinx retrieves and processes module members for documentation.
2. Understand how the `__all__` attribute is currently being utilized, if at all.
3. Find the relevant code in `sphinx.ext.autodoc` that filters or includes module members based on `__all__`.

I will start by searching for classes or methods related to module member processing and documentation generation within the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` module.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("get_module_members")
search_method_in_codebase("filter_members")
search_method_in_codebase("get_object_members")
search_method_in_codebase("Documenter")
search_class_in_codebase("Documenter")
```

You are a PR reviewer that needs to review the patch generated by a bug repair agent and determine whether the issue is fixed or not.
This is the bug issue, which is in the **sympy** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
`Permutation` constructor fails with non-disjoint cycles
Calling `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` raises a `ValueError` instead of constructing the identity permutation.  If the cycles passed in are non-disjoint, they should be applied in left-to-right order and the resulting permutation should be returned.

This should be easy to compute.  I don't see a reason why non-disjoint cycles should be forbidden.

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
## REPRODUCE TEST
```
import sys
from sympy.combinatorics.permutations import Permutation

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        # Attempt to create a Permutation with non-disjoint cycles
        p = Permutation([[0, 1], [0, 1]])
        # If no exception is raised, check if the permutation is the identity
        assert p == Permutation([0, 1]), "The permutation should be the identity permutation."
    except ValueError as e:
        # Print the stack trace and raise an AssertionError
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Permutation constructor raised ValueError for non-disjoint cycles instead of constructing the identity permutation.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

And this is the original output when running the test (before applying the patch):

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

```

The repair agent has tried to generate a patch to fix the issue:
## PATCH CONTEXT
<PATCH_CONTEXT>
```json

  "search_replace_edits": [

  ]
}
```

After applying the patch, the output of the test is:

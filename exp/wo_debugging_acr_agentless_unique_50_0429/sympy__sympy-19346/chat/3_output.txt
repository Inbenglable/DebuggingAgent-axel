To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code for the `reprify` method, which likely handles the conversion of collections like lists, sets, and dicts within the `ReprPrinter` class. This method might be responsible for printing elements properly, and modifying it could resolve the incorrect representation of dicts and sets.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/repr.py", "ReprPrinter.reprify")
```

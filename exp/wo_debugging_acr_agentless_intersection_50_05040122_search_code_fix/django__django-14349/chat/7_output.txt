**Review of the Patch and Test Outputs**

**Patch Review:**

The proposed patch intends to address the issue by modifying the `URLValidator` to strip line feed (LF), carriage return (CR), and tab characters from the input URL before further processing. This should align with the new behavior introduced by Python's bpo-43882, which alters the URL splitting behavior to eliminate these characters before validation.

The patch makes changes to `django/core/validators.py`, specifically adding a line to remove these characters. The search and replace edits suggest inserting this line right before the scheme validation.

**Test Outputs Analysis:**

- **Original Output:**
  - The test outputs indicate failures due to a `ValidationError` not being raised. The URLs tested contain LF characters.
  
- **Patched Output:**
  - After applying the patch, the test results remain unchanged. The `ValidationError` is still not raised for URLs that include LF characters. This indicates that the patch did not resolve the issue.

**Conclusion:**

The intent of the patch was to modify the input URL by stripping unwanted characters, which should have led to a `ValidationError` being raised due to the format of the tested URLs. However, the test outcomes indicate that these validation errors were not triggered, suggesting that the patch did not function as expected.

Issue resolved: `False`

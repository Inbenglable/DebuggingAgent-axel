I have already retrieved the definition of the `Contains` class and its `as_set` method, which currently raises a `NotImplementedError`. To fix this issue, I need to implement the `as_set` method in the `Contains` class to return the set representation of the containment condition instead of returning a `Contains` instance.

To proceed, I need to gather the necessary imports and ensure I have the context required for the `as_set` implementation. 

Let's proceed with gathering the top portion of the `sympy/sets/contains.py` file to ensure I have the correct imports and context necessary for the implementation of `as_set`.

```python
search_code_in_file("sympy/sets/contains.py", "from")
search_code_in_file("sympy/sets/contains.py", "class Contains")
```

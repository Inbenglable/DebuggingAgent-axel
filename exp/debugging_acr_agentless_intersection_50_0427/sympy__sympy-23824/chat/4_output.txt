To address the issue and generate a patch, I need to review the exact implementation of the `kahane_simplify` function, as that's where the bug resides. I will retrieve the source code for this method so I can make the necessary corrections.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/physics/hep/gamma_matrices.py", "kahane_simplify")
```

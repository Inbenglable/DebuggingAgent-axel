The issue revolves around adding DISTINCT support for the Avg, Sum, Min, and Max aggregates in Django. The patch context provided suggests modifications to each class definition to enable DISTINCT by setting `allow_distinct` to `True`.

**Reviewing the Patch:**

The patch aims to introduce DISTINCT support by modifying class definitions in `django/db/models/aggregates.py`:

1. **Avg**: Adding `allow_distinct = True`
2. **Sum**: Adding `allow_distinct = True`
3. **Min**: Adding `allow_distinct = True`
4. **Max**: Adding `allow_distinct = True`

These changes appear consistent with the issue description, which requires enabling DISTINCT support for these aggregation functions.

**Analyzing Test Outputs:**

Both the original and patched test outputs produce the same error:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet.
```

This error indicates an issue with the Django test setupâ€”specifically, the app registry hasn't been correctly initialized, preventing the test code from executing and testing the issue effectively. As a result, the test output cannot confirm whether the patch resolves the issue because the problem lies in the test setup itself rather than the logic being tested.

**Conclusion:**

Due to the consistent presence of the `AppRegistryNotReady` error in both outputs, the test does not run successfully to verify the patch's effectiveness. This means it's not possible to determine from the given test output whether the issue has been resolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

To generate a patch for the issue, I need to retrieve the source code of the method where the snippet `opts = cur_model._meta` is located, in order to ensure the substitution `opts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta` is applied correctly. 

Therefore, I need to search for the method containing this code snippet within the file `django/db/models/sql/query.py`.

```python
search_code_in_file("django/db/models/sql/query.py", "opts = cur_model._meta")
```

Based on the issue description and the retrieved code snippet, we need to modify the logic for "show_save_as_new" in the Django admin template tags. The issue suggests adding an additional permission check (`has_add_permission`) to determine if the "save as new" button should be shown.

Here are the modifications required to fix the issue:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            and has_change_permission\n=======\n            and has_add_permission\n            and has_change_permission\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
``` 

This patch adds the `has_add_permission` check to the conditions for displaying the "save as new" button in the Django admin interface.

Based on the issue description and the test output, the error occurs because the `Paginator` class does not implement the `__iter__` method, which would allow it to be iterable. The test is designed to fail by intentionally not implementing the `__iter__` method in the `MockPaginator`, which inherits from `Paginator`. This results in a `TypeError` because the program attempts to iterate over the `MockPaginator` instance, but the class does not define the `__iter__` method, making it non-iterable.

Given that the error arises from the lack of an `__iter__` method in `Paginator`, the next logical step is to inspect the `Paginator` class's implementation in the Django code to see where this method should be introduced.

Observed method: `django/core/paginator.py:Paginator`

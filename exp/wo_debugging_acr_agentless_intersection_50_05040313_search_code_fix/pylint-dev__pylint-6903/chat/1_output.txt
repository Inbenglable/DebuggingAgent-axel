To resolve the issue, I will need to adjust the behavior of the `_query_cpu` function in the `run.py` file to ensure it never returns zero when the `--jobs=0` flag is used. It is likely that `_query_cpu` is the function that needs attention, as mentioned in the issue description. I will first retrieve the source code for the `_query_cpu` function to confirm where and how it might be modified.

```python
search_method_in_file("pylint/lint/run.py", "_query_cpu")
```

In order to resolve the issue, I need to understand the context of how the `_delete_composed_index` method is being invoked and used within the Django migration framework. Specifically, I need to determine where the method is called to identify any caller's behavior that might affect how the constraints are handled. This information would be valuable for designing an appropriate fix. Therefore, I need to search for occurrences of `_delete_composed_index` in the codebase to locate calls and inspect their context.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("_delete_composed_index")
```

kbd role produces incorrect HTML when compound-key separators (-, + or ^) are used as keystrokes
**Describe the bug**

The `:kbd:` role produces incorrect HTML when:

1) defining standalone keystrokes that use any of the compound-key separators (`-`, `+` and `^`)
2) defining compound keystrokes where one or more keystrokes use any of the compound-key separators (`-`, `+` and `^`)

**To Reproduce**

For the below three keyboard definitions:
```
(1) :kbd:`-`
(2) :kbd:`+`
(3) :kbd:`Shift-+`
```

The following three incorrect output is generated:

(1) `-` is treated as a separator with two "blank" keystrokes around it.

```
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate"></kbd>-<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate"></kbd></kbd>
```

(2) `+` is treated as a separator with two "blank" keystrokes around it.

```
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate"></kbd>+<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate"></kbd></kbd>
```

(3) `+` is treated as a separator within a compound-keystroke, with two "blank" keystrokes around it.

```
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift</kbd>-<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate"></kbd>+<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate"></kbd></kbd>
```

**Expected behavior**

For single keystrokes that use `-`, `+` or`^`, just a single `kbd` element should be created.

For compound-keystrokes, the algorithm should differentiate between `-`, `+` and `^` characters appearing in separator vs keystroke positions (currently, it's very simplistic, it just treats all these characters as separators using a simple regexp).

The debugging test execution result is too long to display here. Please re-select your `runtime_info` lists to narrow down the scope of your analysis.



You need to trace the abnormal program behavior step by step to identify the root cause of the bug and locate the buggy method that contains the code to be fixed.
Now, please first analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior. 

Then, if you can already locate the buggy method and buggy code, reply with:
Buggy method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Otherwise, continue tracing by selecting the next method to observe. Reply with: 
Observed method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Note that {FILE_PATH} refers to the path relative to the repository. And if you want to observe a method inside a class, please specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME.

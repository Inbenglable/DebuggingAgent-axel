To implement the `__iter__` method in the Paginator class, it is crucial to have a complete understanding of the current class implementation. The results of the searches provide only method names and the existence of some properties but not the full implementation of the class. Therefore, before generating the patch, I need to obtain the full source code of the `Paginator` class in the `django/core/paginator.py` file.

Let's search for the entire implementation of the `Paginator` class:

```python
search_class_in_file("django/core/paginator.py", "Paginator")
```

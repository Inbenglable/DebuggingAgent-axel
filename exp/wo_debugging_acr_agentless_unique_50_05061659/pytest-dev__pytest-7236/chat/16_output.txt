Let's start by reviewing the steps involved in the patch application and analyzing the test outputs:

## Patch Analysis

### Original Issue:
The issue is that the `tearDown` method in `unittest` test cases is being called when tests are marked as skipped (using `@unittest.skip`) and run with the `--pdb` flag in pytest version 5.4.2. 

### Patch Context:
The patch introduces a condition in `pytest_runtest_call(item)` function to check if the test item has a skip marker and calls `pytest.skip()` if present. This prevents the execution of `tearDown` for skipped tests.

### Test Setup:
A reproducible test was designed to raise a `NameError` intentionally in `tearDown`, serving to check whether `tearDown` is called on skipped tests with `--pdb`.

## Test Output Analysis

### Original Output:
The original test output reports an error concerning a file not found for the test name specified, and no tests are run.

### Patched Output:
The patched output remains the same, with the error about a file missing for the specified test name, and no tests are executed.

### Observations:
- Both original and patched outputs show that the test case `reproducer.py::MyTestCase::test_one` is not being recognized or run, resulting in an error: "ERROR: file not found".
- Since the test output did not change after applying the patch, it suggests that the patching did not impact the running or skipping of `tearDown`.

## Conclusion

The patch's intention is logical based on the issue context, but it did not demonstrate or verify functionality due to the missing or misconfigured test case file path in the reproducing test commands. The test harness did not confirm or evaluate the patch's effectiveness in fixing the bug.

Therefore, given the unchanged test output and incorrect test setup:
- The proposed patch does not resolve the original issue due to incomplete or incorrect verification.
  
Issue resolved: `False`

To resolve the issue of `ModelChoiceField` not providing the value of an invalid choice when raising a `ValidationError`, I need to modify the error message configuration in the `ModelChoiceField` class. For this, it's necessary to have the source code of the `ModelChoiceField` class, which should be present in the Django forms module. Therefore, I need to retrieve the full source code for this class to understand how to incorporate the invalid value into the error message.

Given the partial code snippet provided, it seems likely that `ModelChoiceField` is defined in a file related to forms. However, to be certain of the location, I will search for the `ModelChoiceField` class in the project codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ModelChoiceField")
```

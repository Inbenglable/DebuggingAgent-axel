To address the issue, I need to review the source code of the `Paginator` class in the Django project to verify where we can implement the `__iter__` method. This will allow me to implement the iteration over the pages naturally.

Let's start by locating the `Paginator` class in the codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Paginator")
```

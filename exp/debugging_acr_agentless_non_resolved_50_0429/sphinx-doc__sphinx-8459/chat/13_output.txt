Based on the test outputs before and after the patch:

1. **Original Output**: The Sphinx build failed due to a missing module (`sphinxarg.ext`), which prevented the test from running successfully to check for the issue.

2. **Patched Output**: The output remains unchanged from the original, indicating the build still fails due to the same missing module, and therefore the test does not run successfully.

Since the Sphinx build error remains the same before and after applying the patch, the test could not evaluate whether the patch truly resolved the issue related to `autodoc_type_aliases`. Thus, no determination can be made about the effectiveness of the patch based on the test execution.

Issue resolved: `False`

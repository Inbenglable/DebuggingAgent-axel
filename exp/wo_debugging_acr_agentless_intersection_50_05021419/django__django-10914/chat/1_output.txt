To address the issue discussed, we need to ensure that the `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting is defined and set to `0o644` in Django. This will involve changes likely in settings or storage-related components. We must first locate and review the relevant code sections that deal with file upload permissions, particularly in `FileSystemStorage` class or related classes.

We will check if there exists a place where the `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION` is set or defaulted within Djangoâ€™s codebase, especially in modules related to storage:

```python
search_class_in_codebase("FileSystemStorage")
search_code_in_codebase("FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS")
```
This will allow us to understand where and how the `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting is being used and to make appropriate adjustments to set its default value.

To fix the bug, I need to update the loop that adds leading gamma matrices back in place in the `kahane_simplify` function to maintain their original order. This change will ensure that leading uncontracted gamma matrices are not reversed during the simplification process. Let's proceed to make the necessary adjustment to the code:

```pythony
### sympy/physics/hep/gamma_matrices.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    for i in range(0, first_dum_pos):
        [ri.insert(0, free_pos[i]) for ri in resulting_indices]
=======
    for i in reversed(range(0, first_dum_pos)):
        [ri.insert(0, free_pos[i]) for ri in resulting_indices]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This modification reverses the order of the loop, ensuring that gamma matrices retain their original order when added back. Here's the formatted JSON response with the patch:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/physics/hep/gamma_matrices.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    for i in range(0, first_dum_pos):\n        [ri.insert(0, free_pos[i]) for ri in resulting_indices]\n=======\n    for i in reversed(range(0, first_dum_pos)):\n        [ri.insert(0, free_pos[i]) for ri in resulting_indices]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

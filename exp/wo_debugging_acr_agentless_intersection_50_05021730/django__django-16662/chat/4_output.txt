To resolve the issue, I need to examine the `MigrationWriter` class, specifically the method that generates import statements in the migration files. This will help me understand how to change the import order when generating migrations.

I'll proceed by searching for the `MigrationWriter` class and its relevant methods.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("MigrationWriter")
search_method_in_codebase("MigrationWriter.as_string")
```

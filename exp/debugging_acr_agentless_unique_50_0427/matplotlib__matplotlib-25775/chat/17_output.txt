**Review of the Patch and Test Output:**

1. **Patch Review:**

   - **Text Class Modifications:** The patch successfully introduces `get_antialiased` and `set_antialiased` methods to the `Text` class, adhering to the proposed solution. These methods should allow for setting and retrieving the antialiasing state on a per-object basis.
   
   - **Backend Code Adjustment:** The change in `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_agg.py` intends to use the individual text object's antialiasing state during the text drawing process.

   However, there is a mistake in the implementation within the `get_antialiased` method. The code attempts to use `rcParams['text.antialiased']`, but `rcParams` is not defined or imported within the scope of `text.py`, leading to the `NameError`.

2. **Test Outputs:**

   - **Original Output:** Clearly indicates the absence of `set_antialiased` in the `Text` class, which aligns with the problem described in the issue.
   
   - **Patched Output:** Shows a `NameError` due to an undefined `rcParams` in the `get_antialiased` method. This error prevents the patched code from executing successfully, thus not resolving the original issue.

**Determination:**

The issue is **not resolved**. The patch introduces a new error (undefined `rcParams`) which prevents the intended functionality from being achieved. The original problem of introducing per-object antialiasing control remains unsolved due to this oversight.

Issue resolved: `False`

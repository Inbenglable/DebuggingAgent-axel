To resolve the issue, I need to examine the `_cull` method's source code to understand the context and structure of `cursor.fetchone()` usage. This is crucial to determine the appropriate patch that prevents the "NoneType" object error. From the issue description, the `_cull` method is located in the file `django/core/cache/backends/db.py`.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/cache/backends/db.py", "_cull")
```

To address the issue with the `Permutation` constructor failing when handling non-disjoint cycles, I need to investigate how the constructor processes its input. The `__new__` method of the `Permutation` class is likely responsible for handling or processing these cycles when an instance is created. 

Therefore, I should retrieve the source code for the `__new__` method in the `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py", "Permutation.__new__")
```

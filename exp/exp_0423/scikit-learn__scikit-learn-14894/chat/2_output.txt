The test you provided shows how the `ZeroDivisionError` occurs during sparse fitting in the `_sparse_fit` method of the `sklearn.svm.base` module. The error traceback points to line 302 in `_sparse_fit`. 

Considering the information provided and the fact that the issue arises due to an empty `support_vectors_` attribute leading to a division by zero, it's likely that somewhere in `_sparse_fit`, the calculation doesn't properly handle the case of empty support vectors.

The next logical step is to inspect the `_sparse_fit` method to understand the operation causing the division by zero and how the sparse matrix affects the procedure.

Observed method: `sklearn/svm/base.py:BaseLibSVM._sparse_fit`

To address the issue of incorrect parenthesizing within the `LatexPrinter._print_Subs` method in the `sympy/printing/latex.py` file, I need to retrieve the source code for this specific method to understand its current implementation. This will help ensure accurate modifications to correctly handle parentheses during LaTeX generation.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/latex.py", "LatexPrinter._print_Subs")
```

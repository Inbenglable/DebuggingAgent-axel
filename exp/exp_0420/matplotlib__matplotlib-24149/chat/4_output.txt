To address the issue, I'll first retrieve the source code for the `_safe_first_finite` method to analyze its implementation and offer a precise fix. Additionally, I'll review the `Axes._convert_dx` method as well, which indirectly invokes `_safe_first_finite`. Once I gather the relevant source code, I'll proceed to generate a patch.

Let's start by retrieving the source code for `_safe_first_finite` method from `lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py` and `Axes._convert_dx` method from `matplotlib/axes/_axes.py`.

```python
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py", "_safe_first_finite")
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py", "_convert_dx")
```

From the issue description and the source code of the `evalf` function retrieved, it seems that the error occurs due to the `elif` branches not covering all possible cases for `re` and `im`, leaving `reprec` and `imprec` potentially undefined when attempting to construct the return value `r`. To address this, we should add an `else` clause at the end of each set of `elif` statements, raising a `NotImplementedError` if the conditions for setting `reprec` or `imprec` are not met.

The precise fix would be to ensure that if none of the existing conditions to calculate `reprec` or `imprec` hold, a `NotImplementedError` is raised, thus preventing the `UnboundLocalError`.

Let's proceed to generate this patch for the `evalf` method in the `sympy/core/evalf.py`.

Ready generation: `True`

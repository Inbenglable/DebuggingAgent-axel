Let's analyze the details provided:

1. **Original Issue**: The bug states that `Avg` and `Sum` aggregates should support the `DISTINCT` keyword, which was previously ignored before Django version 2.2, but now throws an exception.

2. **Reproduce Test**: The test script is intended to verify whether `DISTINCT` can be used with the `Avg`, `Sum`, `Min`, and `Max` aggregates. However, the original output shows a configuration issue with the Django settings that leads to `django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady`.

3. **Patch Context**: The proposed changes involve adding `allow_distinct = True` to the `Avg` and `Sum` aggregates in `django/db/models/aggregates.py`, which should theoretically enable `DISTINCT` support for these aggregates.

4. **Test Output (Before and After Patch)**: The output remains the same both before and after the patch application (`django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady`). This suggests that the reproduce test itself is failing due to improperly configured Django settings or initialization issues rather than the logic in the patch.

**Conclusion**:

The patch itself makes changes to support `DISTINCT` in `Avg` and `Sum`, which aligns with the issue description. However, due to the persistent `AppRegistryNotReady` error in the reproduced test, it's not verified whether this patch resolves the initial problem. Therefore, based solely on the available data (output not changing), there is no evidence to confirm that the issue related to `DISTINCT` support for `Avg` and `Sum` aggregates is resolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

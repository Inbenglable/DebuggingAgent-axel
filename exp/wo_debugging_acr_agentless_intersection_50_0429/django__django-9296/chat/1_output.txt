To resolve this issue, we need to modify the Paginator class to implement the `__iter__` method. However, before we can generate any patch, we should first locate the Paginator class in the Django codebase. Specifically, we need to find the file in which the Paginator class is defined and view its source code. Let's conduct a search to find the Paginator class in the Django codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Paginator")
```

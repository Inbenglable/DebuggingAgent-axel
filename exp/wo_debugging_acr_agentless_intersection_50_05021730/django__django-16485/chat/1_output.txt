To resolve the issue, I need to obtain the source code of the `floatformat` method from the Django project. This will help me understand the current implementation and identify the cause of the `ValueError`.

Since I don't know the file path of the `floatformat` method, I will use the `search_method_in_codebase` API to retrieve its source code.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("floatformat")
```

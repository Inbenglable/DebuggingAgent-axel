To resolve the issue, I need to analyze the `_image()` function mentioned in the issue. This function is likely part of the `homomorphisms.py` file in the SymPy codebase, where permutation group homomorphisms are handled. Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code for `_image()` specifically to understand the current logic and see how it can be improved.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py", "_image")
```

To resolve the issue with `Dagger(A) * IdentityOperator` not simplifying correctly, we will modify the `__mul__` method of the `IdentityOperator` class to recognize instances of `Dagger`. This will ensure that multiplication with the identity operator is simplified for both regular operators and their adjoints.

Here is the necessary patch in the *SEARCH/REPLACE* format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/physics/quantum/operator.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if isinstance(other, Operator):\n=======\n        if isinstance(other, (Operator, Dagger)):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This change will allow the `IdentityOperator` to recognize both `Operator` and `Dagger` instances, ensuring that the multiplication simplification works as intended.

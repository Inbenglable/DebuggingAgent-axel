To address the issue where SequentialFeatureSelector does not properly handle the `cv` parameter when it is an iterable of splits, we need to ensure that the generator is converted to a list. This is because the generator can be exhausted after one iteration, causing subsequent errors.

Here's how we can apply a fix:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sklearn/feature_selection/_sequential.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                estimator,\n                X_new,\n                y,\n                cv=self.cv,\n                scoring=self.scoring,\n                n_jobs=self.n_jobs,\n=======\n                estimator,\n                X_new,\n                y,\n                cv=list(self.cv) if hasattr(self.cv, '__iter__') else self.cv,\n                scoring=self.scoring,\n                n_jobs=self.n_jobs,\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch ensures that if `cv` is an iterable or generator, it is converted to a list before being passed to `cross_val_score`, preventing it from being exhausted prematurely.

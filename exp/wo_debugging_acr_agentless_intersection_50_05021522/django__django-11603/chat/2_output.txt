To add DISTINCT support for Avg, Sum, Min, and Max aggregates, I need to inspect the code for these classes to understand how DISTINCT is currently handled or how it can be added. Given that I already have the class definitions, I should now retrieve the full source code for these classes to examine their implementation details and update them accordingly.

I'll proceed to get the complete class implementations:

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Avg")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Sum")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Min")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Max")
```

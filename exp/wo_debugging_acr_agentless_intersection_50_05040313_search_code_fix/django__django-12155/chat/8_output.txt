To determine whether the issue is fixed, we need to consider both the patch itself and the test outputs before and after applying the patch.

### Patch Analysis
The patch describes a modification to the `trim_docstring` function in the `django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py` file. It changes the computation of `indent` from:

```python
indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())
```

to:

```python
indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())
```

The change here is to skip the first line while calculating indentation, which directly addresses the reported issue that the first line should not contribute to indentation checks.

### Test Output Analysis

#### Original Output
Before applying the patch, the test output shows an `ImportError`:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-12155/reproduce.py", line 4, in <module>
    from django.contrib.admindocs.views import simplify_exception
ImportError: cannot import name 'simplify_exception'
```

This indicates a problem unrelated to the specific docstring indentation calculation, as it fails before reaching the actual test logic. Therefore, no conclusion about the docstring issue can be drawn from this output.

#### Patched Output
After applying the patch, the output remains identical to the original:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-12155/reproduce.py", line 4, in <module>
    from django.contrib.admindocs.views import simplify_exception
ImportError: cannot import name 'simplify_exception'
```

Since the `ImportError` persists and prevents the test from running, we cannot determine if the patch resolves the described issue with docstring indentation.

### Conclusion

The presence of the `ImportError` in both outputs prevents the execution of the test that would verify the patch's effectiveness. Consequently, no resolution or continuation of logic related to the original issue with docstring rendering is observed.

Issue resolved: `False`

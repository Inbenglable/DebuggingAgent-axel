Based on the issue description, we are dealing with the `ds.Coarsen.construct` method demoting non-dimensional coordinates to variables. The focus is on how the `construct` method behaves, specifically within the `DatasetCoarsen` context.

Let's analyze the returned results:

1. **xarray/core/rolling.py:DataArrayRolling.construct**: This relates to `DataArrayRolling`, a different context (rolling) and not related to `Coarsen`. Hence, it's not needed.
   
2. **xarray/core/rolling.py:DatasetRolling.construct**: Similar to the above, this is for `DatasetRolling`. It pertains to rolling operations, not coarsening, so it's not needed.

3. **xarray/core/rolling.py:Coarsen.construct**: This is directly related to `Coarsen`, focusing on converting a `Coarsen` object to a `DataArray` or `Dataset`. This content is the most relevant as it addresses the coarsening operation, similar to what `ds.Coarsen.construct` is expected to handle.

From the analysis, only the third entry (the `Coarsen.construct` method) is relevant to the reported issue.

Here's the selection:

```
xarray/core/rolling.py:Coarsen.construct
```

The patch makes a modification to the `_safe_first_finite` function in `lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py`. Previously, the function was raising a `StopIteration` error when it encountered an iterable containing only NaN values. The patch changes this function to return `None` instead of raising an error when no finite values are found.

### Review of the Patch:
- **Change Made**: The line `return next(val for val in obj if safe_isfinite(val))` is changed to `return next((val for val in obj if safe_isfinite(val)), None)`.
- **Impact of Change**: This change prevents the `StopIteration` error by providing a default value (`None`) for the `next` function to return when the generator does not produce any values (i.e., when all values are NaN).
- **Correctness**: The change appears to be correct for the issue at hand, as it addresses the scenario where all elements in an input are NaN, which previously led to an exception.

### Analysis of Test Output:
- **Original Output**: The original test output indicates that an error occurred when trying to create a bar plot with all-NaN data, as expected from the issue description.
- **Patched Output**: The patched output shows the absence of the `StopIteration` error, indicating that the execution progresses past the point where the exception was previously raised.

Given the nature of the change and the provided test outputs before and after the patch, the issue of `ax.bar` raising an exception for all-NaN data is resolved. There are no errors related to the specific problem observed in the original output after applying the patch.

Issue resolved: `True`

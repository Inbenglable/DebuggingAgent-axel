srepr not printing dict and set properly
`srepr` prints the element in `list` and `tuple` correctly.
```python
>>> from sympy import srepr
>>> from sympy.abc import x,y
>>> srepr([x,y])
[Symbol('x'), Symbol('y')]
>>> srepr((x,y))
(Symbol('x'), Symbol('y'))
```

However, `srepr` prints the elements in `dict` and `set` wrong.
```python
>>> srepr({x, y})
{x, y}
>>> srepr({x: y})
{x: y}
```

Is this behavior intended? If it isn't, fixing it will be an easy job.

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
Based on the issue description and the test failure output, the problem lies in the `srepr` method not correctly handling `set` and `dict` types in the `sympy` library. The test clearly indicates that the expected output for a set should be represented as `FiniteSet(Symbol('x'), Symbol('y'))`, and for a dict as `Dict(Symbol('x'), Symbol('y'))`, but instead, it simply outputs `{y, x}` and `{x: y}` respectively. The printing of the set and dict directly using their Python representations instead of SymPy's internal representations is incorrect according to the test expectations.

In the provided output, we see that `srepr` is a function within the file `sympy/printing/repr.py`. This function calls `ReprPrinter(settings).doprint(expr)`, which indicates that the printing is being done by the `doprint` method of the `ReprPrinter` class. Hence, the abnormal behavior is likely due to this method failing to detect sets and dicts and pass them to appropriate handler methods, which should convert them into `FiniteSet` and `Dict`.

We should start by inspecting the `doprint` method in the `ReprPrinter` class to trace how it processes different types of input. This will help us determine why it is handling sets and dicts improperly.

Observed method: `sympy/printing/printer.py:ReprPrinter.doprint`
==================================================
Based on the current analysis, the issue seems to stem from the `doprint` method inside the `ReprPrinter` class, which calls `self._print(expr)`. The default behavior of `_print` does not handle `dict` and `set` objects following SymPy's internal representation for `srepr`. Consequently, these types are rendered using their standard Python representations. 

To resolve this, I need to observe the `_print` method implementation in `ReprPrinter` to ensure it appropriately handles `set` and `dict` objects by forwarding them to a suitable handler that returns a `FiniteSet` or `Dict` representation.

Observed scope: `sympy/printing/printer.py:251-251`
==================================================
Based on the analysis of the current observation, the issue arises from improper handling of `set` and `dict` types when using the `srepr` function. The `doprint` method in `ReprPrinter` calls the `_print` method, which traverses the Python class hierarchy (`classes`) of `expr` looking for a suitable print method specifically for the `set` type (i.e., `_print_set`). However, it seems that no such method is implemented for handling a `set` type using SymPy's internal representation. Consequently, the `_print` method defaults to using `self.emptyPrinter(expr)`, which results in the standard Python representation `{y, x}`.

To resolve the issue, a specialized print method for the `set` type, likely named `_print_set`, should be implemented to transform it appropriately into SymPy's `FiniteSet` representation.

Now, based on this analysis, I will locate and analyze the `_print` method, specifically observing if a print method for sets might exist, and inspect the logic where it defaults to using `emptyPrinter`.

Buggy method: `sympy/printing/printer.py:ReprPrinter._print`
==================================================


Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

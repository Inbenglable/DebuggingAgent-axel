The `get_group_by` code provided showcases how it processes `order_by` expressions and integrates them into the `GROUP BY` clause. It appears that the key logic responsible for unintentionally including fields specified in `Meta.ordering` into `GROUP BY` resides in how the `order_by` expressions are assessed and handled around line 133. Therefore, I have the necessary information now to generate a patch to rectify this issue.

Ready generation: `True`

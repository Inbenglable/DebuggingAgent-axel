To address the issue described, we must focus on the `ZeroDivisionError` that occurs in the `_sparse_fit` method in the `sklearn/svm/base.py` file. From the traceback and execution flow, we can identify that the error stems from an operation in the `_sparse_fit` method involving division by `n_class`. 

Given that division by zero indicates `n_class` is zero during execution, we need to examine this method further to understand why this variable takes zero as its value.

I will proceed by examining the `_sparse_fit` method to pinpoint where the division occurs and identify which part of the logic allows `n_class` to be zero, leading to this error.

Observed method: `sklearn/svm/base.py:_sparse_fit`

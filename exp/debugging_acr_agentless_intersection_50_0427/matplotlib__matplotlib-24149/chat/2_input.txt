[Bug]: ax.bar raises for all-nan data on matplotlib 3.6.1 
### Bug summary

`ax.bar` raises an exception in 3.6.1 when passed only nan data. This irrevocably breaks seaborn's histogram function (which draws and then removes a "phantom" bar to trip the color cycle).

### Code for reproduction

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
f, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.bar([np.nan], [np.nan])
```


### Actual outcome

```python-traceback
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
StopIteration                             Traceback (most recent call last)

   2183     except (TypeError, IndexError, KeyError):
   2184         pass

   1747                        "support generators as input")
   1748 else:
-> 1749     return next(val for val in obj if safe_isfinite(val))

StopIteration: 
```

### Expected outcome

On 3.6.0 this returns a `BarCollection` with one Rectangle, having `nan` for `x` and `height`.

### Additional information

I assume it's related to this bullet in the release notes:

- Fix barplot being empty when first element is NaN

But I don't know the context for it to investigate further (could these link to PRs?)

Further debugging:

```python
ax.bar([np.nan], [0])  # Raises
ax.bar([0], [np.nan])  # Works
```

So it's about the x position specifically.

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
To trace and understand the root cause of the issue, we need to examine the execution flow and identify the point of failure. The error traceback indicates that the problem arises in the `_safe_first_finite` function, which is invoked from within `Axes._convert_dx`. The goal is to detect where this process goes astray with `nan` values.

Here's the step-by-step observation of the execution flow:

1. The test code attempts to plot a bar graph where the data passed to `ax.bar()` comprises `np.nan` values for both the x and y positions.

2. This raises a `StopIteration` error, and the traceback indicates that the issue occurs at:

   - File: `matplotlib/axes/_axes.py`
   - In the `Axes._convert_dx` method.

   Specifically in this line:

   ```python
   x0 = cbook._safe_first_finite(x0)
   ```

3. The `StopIteration` exception stems from this line in the `cbook._safe_first_finite` function:

    ```python
    return next(val for val in obj if safe_isfinite(val))
    ```

This shows that on encountering only `NaN` values, the generator expression inside `_safe_first_finite` fails to find any finite numbers, leading `next()` to throw a `StopIteration` exception.

Knowing that `_safe_first_finite` is failing due to the lack of finite values, the following line in the `Axes._convert_dx` method directly leads to the observed issue.

Thus, based on the traceback, the exact file and method where the bug occurs is:

Buggy method: `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py:Axes._convert_dx`
==================================================


Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

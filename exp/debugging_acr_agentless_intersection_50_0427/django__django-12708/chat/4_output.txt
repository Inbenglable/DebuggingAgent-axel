To resolve the issue, I need to examine the `_delete_composed_index` method in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` to check how the logic can be adjusted to handle both constraints (`unique_together` and `index_together` on the same fields) properly. Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code for this method.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "_delete_composed_index")
```

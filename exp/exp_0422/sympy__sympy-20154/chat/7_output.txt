To resolve the issue concerning the `partitions()` method in the `sympy.utilities.iterables` module, I need to first retrieve its source code to understand its exact implementation context. This will help in generating the correct patch to ensure that a copy of the dictionary is yielded instead of the dictionary itself. I'll proceed with retrieving the source code of the `partitions` method.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/utilities/iterables.py", "partitions")
```

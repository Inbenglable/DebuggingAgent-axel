To resolve the issue, I need to inspect the specific code surrounding `req.method = method.upper()` found in `sessions.py`. This could help me understand how `method` is being processed and determine the correct approach to deal with the UnicodeDecodeError.

Additionally, I need to examine the `request` method in the `sessions` file to understand how `method` is utilized and see if there is any specific handling logic that needs adjustments for supporting Unicode.

Here are the API calls I will make:

```python
search_code_in_file("requests/sessions.py", "req.method = method.upper()")
search_method_in_file("requests/sessions.py", "request")
```

Based on the requirements, I need to find the `_latex` method for the `Subs` class, specifically one that is most likely involved in the Sympy project for rendering LaTeX. The output from the API invocation, unfortunately, only traces various `_latex` methods unrelated to `Subs`, and since none of them are directly associated with `Subs`, I suspect the method might be located in the `sympy/printing/latex.py` file under the `_print_Subs` method. Let's check results related to searching for `_print_Subs`.

As per the current API results, none of the entries are related to `Subs._latex` in `sympy.core.function`. Therefore, none of the returned entries matches the necessary requirement to resolve the bug currently presented.

Since none of these are related to `Subs`, I would proceed by checking the search results from `search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/latex.py", "_print_Subs")` to find the needed method.

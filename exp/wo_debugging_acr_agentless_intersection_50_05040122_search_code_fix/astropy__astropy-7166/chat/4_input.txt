Now You need to reolve the following issue in the **astropy** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
InheritDocstrings metaclass doesn't work for properties
Inside the InheritDocstrings metaclass it uses `inspect.isfunction` which returns `False` for properties.

</ISSUE>


You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue related to the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass and its interaction with properties, I need to locate the source code of the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass within the Astropy project. This will enable me to understand its current implementation and identify where changes need to be made to handle properties correctly. Therefore, I will search for the `InheritDocstrings` class in the codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("InheritDocstrings")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_class_in_codebase("InheritDocstrings")
RESULT:
#### astropy/utils/misc.py:InheritDocstrings
```python
class InheritDocstrings(type):
    """
    This metaclass makes methods of a class automatically have their
    docstrings filled in from the methods they override in the base
    class.

    If the class uses multiple inheritance, the docstring will be
    chosen from the first class in the bases list, in the same way as
    methods are normally resolved in Python.  If this results in
    selecting the wrong docstring, the docstring will need to be
    explicitly included on the method.

    For example::

        >>> from astropy.utils.misc import InheritDocstrings
        >>> class A(metaclass=InheritDocstrings):
        ...     def wiggle(self):
        ...         "Wiggle the thingamajig"
        ...         pass
        >>> class B(A):
        ...     def wiggle(self):
        ...         pass
        >>> B.wiggle.__doc__
        u'Wiggle the thingamajig'
    """

    def __init__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        ...
```


==================================================

Your Output:
To resolve the issue, I need to review the current implementation of the `__init__` method within the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass. Therefore, I will search for this method in the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/utils/misc.py", "InheritDocstrings.__init__")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_file("astropy/utils/misc.py", "InheritDocstrings.__init__")
RESULT:
#### astropy/utils/misc.py:InheritDocstrings.__init__
```python
    def __init__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        def is_public_member(key):
            return (
                (key.startswith('__') and key.endswith('__')
                 and len(key) > 4) or
                not key.startswith('_'))

        for key, val in dct.items():
            if (inspect.isfunction(val) and
                is_public_member(key) and
                val.__doc__ is None):
                for base in cls.__mro__[1:]:
                    super_method = getattr(base, key, None)
                    if super_method is not None:
                        val.__doc__ = super_method.__doc__
                        break

        super().__init__(name, bases, dct)

```


==================================================

Your Output:
To resolve the issue, I need to modify the implementation of the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass to correctly handle properties in addition to functions. Therefore, I need to inspect how properties are defined and potentially override their docstrings, similar to the functions. For this, I am ready to generate the patch, as I already have the current implementation of the `__init__` method of `InheritDocstrings`.

Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

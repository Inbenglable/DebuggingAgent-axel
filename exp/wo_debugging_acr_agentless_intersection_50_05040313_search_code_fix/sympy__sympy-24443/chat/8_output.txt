To determine whether the patch successfully resolves the issue, let's analyze the test output before and after applying the patch:

### Original Output

Before applying the patch, the test results in a `ValueError` with the message: "The given images do not define a homomorphism". This indicates that the homomorphism function is not able to properly handle the inverted generators in the `PermutationGroup`.

### Patched Output

After applying the patch, the test produces a different error: "TypeError: bad operand type for abs(): 'FreeGroupElement'", which occurs when trying to execute `abs(r[i])`. This error suggests that the patch introduced a new issue related to operand type handling within the `_image()` function.

### Analysis of the Patch

The patch attempts to handle the inverted generators by using `abs(r[i])`, thereby simplifying the code when dealing with inverse generators. However, the error in the patched output arises because `abs()` was applied to a `FreeGroupElement`, which is not appropriate. This indicates that the patch did not correctly resolve the original issue and instead introduced a new error.

### Conclusion

Given the patched output produces a new error rather than resolving or maintaining the original error, the issue is not fixed by the changes introduced in the patch. Thus, we must conclude:

Issue resolved: `False`

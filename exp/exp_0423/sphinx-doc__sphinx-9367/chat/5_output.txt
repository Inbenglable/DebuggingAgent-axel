From the current observation of the `unparse` function in `sphinx/pycode/ast.py`, the issue arises from the call to `_UnparseVisitor(code).visit(node)`. The `visit` method is responsible for traversing the AST and converting it back to a string representation. Since the output `(1)` does not match the expected `(1,)`, the incorrect handling of single-element tuples likely occurs within the `_UnparseVisitor` class or its relevant visit methods.

Therefore, to trace further, I need to observe the implementation details within the `_UnparseVisitor` class, specifically the scope involved with visiting tuples.

Observed scope: `sphinx/pycode/ast.py:83-120`

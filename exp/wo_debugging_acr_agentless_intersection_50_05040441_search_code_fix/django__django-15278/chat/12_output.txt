Upon analysis, the test output both before and after applying the patch remains the same:

```
AttributeError: module 'django.db.migrations' has no attribute 'OneToOneField'
```

This indicates that the error is not related to the SQLite alteration or the unique constraint but instead to an incorrect usage of `migrations.OneToOneField`. The correct module for `OneToOneField` is `models.OneToOneField`, not `migrations.OneToOneField`.

There is no change in the output after applying the patch, and the core issue causing the error has not been addressed in the provided patch. Thus, the issue has not been resolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

Based on the retrieved source code for the `RelatedPopulator.__init__` method, we have sufficient context to understand the initialization procedure where the error arises due to incorrect proxy model handling. Specifically, the bug manifests when resolving the `init_list` attribute for proxy models, leading to missing primary key fields needed for correct query execution.

To address this, we should ensure that the `init_list` for models includes attributes from concrete models, including primary keys, even when proxy inheritance is involved.

Since the relevant logic for initializing `init_list` and determining `pk_idx` is entirely contained within the `RelatedPopulator.__init__` method, we can directly proceed to generate a patch for modifying this method to correctly handle proxy models.

Ready generation: `True`

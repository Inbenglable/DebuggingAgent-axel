The issue arises from using `LooseVersion` for version comparison, which fails when comparing a version that includes both numeric and non-numeric parts (e.g., '1.14.3' and '1.14dev'). This is due to a known bug in `LooseVersion` where it cannot handle comparisons between integers and strings, resulting in a `TypeError`.

The tested function `test_version_comparison` attempts to demonstrate this behavior using the `LooseVersion` class. The comparison fails because `LooseVersion` is unable to handle the mixed-type elements in the version string.

The `minversion` function in `astropy/utils/introspection.py` seems to utilize `LooseVersion` for version comparison. Given the pattern of functionality and the description, it suggests that the core issue resides in this function using `LooseVersion`, which is not robust against version strings containing both numeric and non-numeric elements.

To address this problem, the logic in `minversion` needs to be revised to use a more resilient version parsing library or method, such as `pkg_resources.parse_version`, as this correctly handles such comparisons without error.

Therefore, the observed buggy behavior from using `LooseVersion` for version comparison in this context leads to identifying the problematic method being:

Buggy method: `astropy/utils/introspection.py:minversion`

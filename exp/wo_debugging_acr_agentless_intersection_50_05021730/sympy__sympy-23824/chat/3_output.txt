To address the issue where the leading gamma matrices are reinserted in reverse order, we can modify the section of the `kahane_simplify` function where the leading gamma matrices are added back to the `resulting_indices`. The current implementation reverses the order by directly inserting them at the beginning, which can be adjusted to maintain the original sequence.

Hereâ€™s the edit in `search/replace` format:

```pythony
### sympy/physics/hep/gamma_matrices.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        [ri.insert(0, free_pos[i]) for ri in resulting_indices]
=======
        [ri.append(free_pos[i]) for ri in resulting_indices]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's convert the patch into the specified JSON format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/physics/hep/gamma_matrices.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        [ri.insert(0, free_pos[i]) for ri in resulting_indices]\n=======\n        [ri.append(free_pos[i]) for ri in resulting_indices]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

To resolve the issue, the problem seems to be within the Django query system when handling proxy models in combination with `select_related()` and `only()`. The provided potential fix involves modifying a line of code in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`. 

To generate a patch, we need to view the surrounding code where the change is suggested to understand the context and validate the proposed modification. Let's retrieve the code snippet around the `opts = cur_model._meta` line, in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`.

```python
search_code_in_file("django/db/models/sql/query.py", "opts = cur_model._meta")
```

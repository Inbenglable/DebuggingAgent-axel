Based on the analysis, we need to understand how the `Plotter._finalize_figure` method is currently implemented to properly address the issue. 

Since the issue is observed in the `_finalize_figure` method and potentially within the `Plotter` class concerning the axis setup, we need to retrieve the source code of both the `Plotter` class and the `_finalize_figure` method to ensure comprehensive understanding of the current logic.

I'll proceed to retrieve the relevant code.

```python
search_class_in_file("seaborn/_core/plot.py", "Plotter")
search_method_in_file("seaborn/_core/plot.py", "_finalize_figure")
```

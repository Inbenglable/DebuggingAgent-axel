To address the issue, I need to retrieve the source code of the `fowlkes_mallows_score` method in the `scikit-learn` project. Based on the issue description, the relevant portion of the code is in the `sklearn/metrics/cluster/supervised.py` file. I will search for the method within this file to inspect the implementation and propose a fix. 

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/metrics/cluster/supervised.py", "fowlkes_mallows_score")
```

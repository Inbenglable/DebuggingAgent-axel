In order to address the issue, I need to analyze the implementation of the `units.quantity_input` decorator within the astropy project. I want to particularly see how it handles return type annotations and how units conversion is possibly achieved. I'll need to retrieve relevant source code.

Let's begin by locating the `quantity_input` decorator in the codebase. If necessary, I'll also explore the classes or methods associated with this functionality.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("quantity_input")
search_code_in_codebase("return_.to(wrapped_signature.return_annotation)")
```

To resolve the issue at hand, it's essential to locate the source code for the `bar` method in the `Axes` class, as well as the `_safe_first_finite` function in the `cbook` module, which are mentioned in the traceback. Understanding how these functions work will help determine why `ax.bar([np.nan], [np.nan])` raises an exception and how it can be modified to handle `nan` values more gracefully.

Let's fetch the relevant source code.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Axes")
search_method_in_codebase("Axes.bar")
search_method_in_codebase("_safe_first_finite")
```

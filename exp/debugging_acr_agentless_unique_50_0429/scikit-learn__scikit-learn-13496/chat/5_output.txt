To expose the `warm_start` parameter in the `IsolationForest` class, I need to add it to the `__init__` method and ensure it is properly set in the call to the `super().__init__`. Since I already have the source code of the `IsolationForest.__init__` method, I can proceed to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

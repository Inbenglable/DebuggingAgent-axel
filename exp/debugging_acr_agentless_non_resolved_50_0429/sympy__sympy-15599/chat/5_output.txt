The issue is that the `Mod` operation is not simplifying `Mod(3*i, 2)` to `Mod(i, 2)` as expected. Based on the provided diff and the description, we see that the proposed solution affects the `doit` method in the `sympy/core/mod.py` file. 

From the execution trace, it becomes evident that the `Mod` function is not performing the intended simplification. The current behavior results in `Mod(3*i, 2)` remaining unchanged, and therefore the assertion in the test fails. The failure implies that either the simplification is not being attempted, or the conditions necessary for the simplification in the affected method are not met.

To continue diagnosing the issue, we should observe the `doit` method in the `sympy/core/mod.py` file to understand how it currently processes the input and why it fails to simplify the expression.

Observed method: `sympy/core/mod.py:doit`

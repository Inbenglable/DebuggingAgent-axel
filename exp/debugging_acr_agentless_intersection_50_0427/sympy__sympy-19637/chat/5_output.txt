To determine whether the issue is resolved, I'll review the provided patch, as well as the test outputs before and after applying the patch.

### Review of the Patch
- **Problem Addressed**: The issue was caused by the variable `kern` being used before it was assigned, leading to an `UnboundLocalError`.
- **Patch**: The patch initializes `kern` with an empty string before its usage to ensure that it's always assigned a value before being referenced.
  
  ```python
  kern = ''
  hit = False
  ```

This change ensures that `kern` is defined in all code paths, thus preventing the `UnboundLocalError`.

### Analysis of Test Outputs

#### Original Output (Before the Patch)
The test resulted in an `UnboundLocalError` because `kern` was referenced before being assigned:

```
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'kern' referenced before assignment
```

#### Patched Output (After the Patch)
The output consists of no errors, suggesting the test completed without encountering the `UnboundLocalError`:

```

```

### Conclusion
The patch correctly initializes `kern` before it is used and the absence of errors in the patched output indicates that the test now runs successfully without causing an `UnboundLocalError`. Thus, the issue is resolved.

Issue resolved: `True`

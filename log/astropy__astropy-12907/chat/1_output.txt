To address the issue, we need to create a minimal debugging test based on the reproducible test provided. This test should focus on the nested compound model, as that is where the issue arises. We'll simplify the code to focus on the components directly involved in the problem. The goal is to isolate the nested compound model issue for debugging purposes.

Here is the specific debugging test code in JSON format:

```json
{
  "debugging_test": "from astropy.modeling import models as m\nfrom astropy.modeling.separable import separability_matrix\n\n# Debugging Test: Nested compound model\nnested_cm = m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & (m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5))\nprint('Debugging Test: Nested compound model')\nprint(separability_matrix(nested_cm))"
}
```

This test isolates the problematic scenario of nesting compound models and prints the resulting separability matrix. This will help us focus on identifying the root cause of the incorrect separability computation.

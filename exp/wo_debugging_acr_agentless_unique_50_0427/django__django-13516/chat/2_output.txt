Based on the current information, it seems necessary to investigate further how the `flush()` method is called in the Django management commands, specifically looking into how the output is handled during the migration process. This might involve examining the command classes and methods responsible for managing standard output and error. A search for the `flush` method in relevant files, particularly around the management command handling, is essential to proceed.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("flush")
search_class_in_codebase("MigrationExecutor")
search_class_in_codebase("BaseCommand")
```

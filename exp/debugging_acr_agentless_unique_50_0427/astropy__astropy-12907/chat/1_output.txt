In analyzing the information provided, we have a test case that exposes an issue with the `separability_matrix` function. The separability matrix is expected to identify independent and separable inputs and outputs in models, but when applied to a nested compound model, the output is not as expected from the test.

The key issue is that when a model is nested, it seems to fail in computing separability correctly, showing dependency where there should be independence. The output array suggests that it treats all outputs of the `Pix2Sky_TAN` component as affecting all the inputs of the `Linear1D` components, which is incorrect.

In addressing this, we can trace the flow and logic within the `separability_matrix` function located in "astropy/modeling/separable.py" to determine where it incorrectly evaluates model separability in nested structures.

Therefore, the next step is to look more closely into the separability analysis logic specifically within this function to understand why it fails to evaluate nested models correctly.

Observed method: `astropy/modeling/separable.py:separability_matrix`

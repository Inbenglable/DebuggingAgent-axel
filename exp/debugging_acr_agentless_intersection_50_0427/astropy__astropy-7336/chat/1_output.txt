The issue arises when applying the `units.quantity_input` decorator to a constructor with a type-hinted return value of `None`. The decorator tries to convert the return value (`None`) using the `to` method, which is not available on `NoneType`, leading to the `AttributeError`.

The traceback indicates that the error originates from line 224 in the `astropy/units/decorators.py` file within the `wrapper` function. At this line, the code attempts to apply the `to` method on the return value, which is `None`.

Buggy method: `astropy/units/decorators.py:wrapper`

To address the issue and simplify the signature of the `DatabaseOperations.execute_sql_flush` method by removing the `using` argument, we'll make the following modifications:

1. Adjust the method's signature to remove the `using` parameter.
2. Change the usage within the method to use `self.connection.alias` instead.

Here's the **SEARCH/REPLACE** patch for this change:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/backends/base/operations.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    def execute_sql_flush(self, using, sql_list):\n=======\n    def execute_sql_flush(self, sql_list):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/backends/base/operations.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        with transaction.atomic(using=using, savepoint=self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl):\n=======\n        with transaction.atomic(using=self.connection.alias, savepoint=self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

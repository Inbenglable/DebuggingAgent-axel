To resolve the issue, I need to locate the specific code where the KeyError occurs. Based on the traceback provided, it occurs in the `generate_renamed_models` method of the `MigrationAutodetector` class, specifically at the line where `del deconstruction[2]['to']` is executed. 

To proceed, I need to retrieve the source code of the `generate_renamed_models` method in the `autodetector.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/autodetector.py", "MigrationAutodetector.generate_renamed_models")
```

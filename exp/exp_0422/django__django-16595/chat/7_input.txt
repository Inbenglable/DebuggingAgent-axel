#### ISSUE
Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField
Description
	
Let's consider the following operations: 
operations = [
	migrations.AddField(
		model_name="book",
		name="title",
		field=models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True),
	),
	migrations.AlterField(
		model_name="book",
		name="title",
		field=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True),
	),
	migrations.AlterField(
		model_name="book",
		name="title",
		field=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text="help"),
	),
	migrations.AlterField(
		model_name="book",
		name="title",
		field=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text="help", default=None),
	),
]
If I run the optimizer, I get only the AddField, as we could expect. However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:
optimizer.optimize(operations[1:], "books") 
[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,
 <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,
 <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]
Indeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. 
Is this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? 
Otherwise, would it make sense to add something like
		if isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(
			operation
		):
			return [operation]

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
Analyzing the current code and the abnormal program behavior, we can note the following:

1. **Observed Behavior**: The optimizer should reduce multiple `AlterField` operations to only the last `AlterField` operation when they all apply to the same field. This expected behavior is shown when the `AddField` operation is included. However, when only `AlterField` operations are provided, the optimizer incorrectly retains multiple operations instead of combining them into a single operation, containing the ultimate state.

2. **Expected Behavior**: The optimizer should be reduced to only a single 'AlterField' operation with the field characteristics of the last 'AlterField' operation's field.

3. **Locate Bug**: The relevant portion of the behavior is within `AlterField.reduce`. The method currently returns a list containing the current `operation` assuming that is a valid subsequent optimization, but does not correctly handle subsequent `AlterField` operations in the sequence.

This suggests that the bug lies within the handling logic of `AlterField.reduce`, as this method directly influences whether a reduction occurs in the set of operations.

Buggy method: `debugging_test.py:AlterField.reduce`
==================================================

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To address the issue, we need to gather more information on the method `AlterField.reduce` because this is where the bug is located. I will search for this method in the codebase since the file it's in hasn't been specified.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("AlterField.reduce")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("AlterField.reduce")
RESULT:
#### reproduce.py:AlterField.reduce
```python
    def reduce(self, operation, app_label):
        if isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(operation):
            # Return the latest AlterField operation since it contains all the changes
            return [operation]
        return super().reduce(operation, app_label)

```

#### django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py:AlterField.reduce
```python
    def reduce(self, operation, app_label):
        if isinstance(operation, RemoveField) and self.is_same_field_operation(
            operation
        ):
            return [operation]
        elif (
            isinstance(operation, RenameField)
            and self.is_same_field_operation(operation)
            and self.field.db_column is None
        ):
            return [
                operation,
                AlterField(
                    model_name=self.model_name,
                    name=operation.new_name,
                    field=self.field,
                ),
            ]
        return super().reduce(operation, app_label)

```


==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

### IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

### IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

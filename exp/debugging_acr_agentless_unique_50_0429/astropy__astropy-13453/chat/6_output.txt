Based on the analysis of the `HTMLTable.write` method, it seems that the formatting expected from the `formats` parameter is not being applied during the conversion of column values to string representations within the HTML writing process. The section involving `col.info.iter_str_vals()` appears to merely convert values to strings without accounting for any specified formatting.

An abnormality occurs because the typical procedure for applying `formats` to other output formats involves transforming values using provided lambdas or format strings within the `formats` argument before finalizing the string output. This means the logic responsible for transformation is missing or not appropriately engaged within this context of HTML output.

The potential source of the bug might involve understanding how `iter_str_vals` is supposed to be invoked with specific format transformations but fails to integrate such logic for HTML output. Since the current observation does not include any direct mention of `formats`, further exploration of the interface for `iter_str_vals` or adjacent logic used for string transformation in other formats is required.

Thus, the next logical step would be to trace the code from `col.info.iter_str_vals()` and understand if there is an opportunity or missing logic for applying `formats` during this transformation process.

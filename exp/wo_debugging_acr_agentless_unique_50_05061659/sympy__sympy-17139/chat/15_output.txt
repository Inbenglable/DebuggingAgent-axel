Before determining whether the issue is resolved, let's review the provided information:

1. **Patch Context**:
   - The bug involves an invalid comparison of complex exponent `rv.exp` in `sympy/simplify/fu.py`.
   - The proposed patch introduces checks to ensure that `rv.exp` is a number before performing comparisons with `0` and `max`.

2. **Testing before the patch**:
   - The test script fails initially with a `NameError: name 'I' is not defined`.
   - This error is unrelated to the initial bug description (`Invalid comparison of complex I`).

3. **Testing after the patch**:
   - The patched output shows the same `NameError: name 'I' is not defined`.
   - Consequently, the assertion results in an `AssertionError`, indicating the issue persists.

**Analysis**:
- The original and patched outputs both show `NameError: name 'I' is not defined`, which suggests the test is not correctly evaluating whether the original issue (invalid comparison of complex exponent `I`) is fixed.
- The test script must first fix the `NameError` before it can assess whether the comparison error is resolved.
- Given that the patch introduces a conditional check to handle non-comparable complex exponents, it is prudent, assuming that the patch is applied correctly, that it should address the particular issue of complex number comparisons.

**Conclusion**:
Since the test script is not accurately testing the bug due to a separate error, it cannot ascertain whether the issue is resolved. Without a proper test execution, the question of whether the issue is fixed remains inconclusive.

Issue resolved: `False`

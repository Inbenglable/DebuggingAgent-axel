To address the issue, I need to determine how the Sphinx project registers index entries for `py:method` directives with the `:property:` option. Specifically, I need to understand where and how the project handles index entry formatting for such directives.

I will begin by searching for the relevant method or class that pertains to handling or processing `py:method` directives and generating index entries, which is likely within the Sphinx codebase. Given that these functionalities are expansive, examining the core components or modules related to directive processing seems pertinent.

Using the task information, it seems likely that the issue is related to the method or property processing functionalities. I will search for possibly relevant parts of the code in the core sphinx modules to guide the understanding necessary for correcting this issue.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("handle_signature")  # Common method for handling directives
search_method_in_codebase("add_target_and_index")  # Method might involve adding an entry to an index
```
These searches are designed to discover where the project code processes the directives that may be misregistering index entries.

Based on the observation, the issue arises from how the separability matrix is constructed for nested `CompoundModels`. The `separability_matrix` function computes the matrix for each model individually and then uses the `_cstack` operation to combine the matrices.

### Analysis:

1. **Matrix Construction**: The separability matrices are correctly formed for individual models. However, when nested, the `_operators[transform.op](sepleft, sepright)` operation, which uses `_cstack`, doesn't properly account for the nesting.

2. **Observations from Runtime Information**:
   - Each individual compound model's matrix is calculated correctly.
   - The `_cstack` function combines these matrices, but it fails to consider the independence of nested inputs/outputs properly.
   - When `sepleft` and `sepright` are combined, the function creates a combined matrix that implies dependencies between outputs that should remain independent, evident in the incorrect result for the nested compound model case.

3. **Potential Issue Location**: The problem seems to stem from:
   - How the `sepleft` and `sepright` matrices are combined using the `_cstack` operation.
   - Specifically, adjustments within `_cstack` might be required to maintain the separability information of nested structure correctly.

Based on this analysis, the potential issue lies within `_cstack`'s handling of nested compound models. Therefore, I will select the `astropy/modeling/separable.py:_cstack` method for further observation.

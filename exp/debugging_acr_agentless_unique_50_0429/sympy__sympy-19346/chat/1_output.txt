The issue lies in the `srepr` function from SymPy, which is not representing sets and dictionaries properly. The expected output for a set should be a representation in the form of `FiniteSet` with elements wrapped in `Symbol`, while the current output is just showing the plain elements, like `y` and `x`. This indicates `srepr` isn't handling sets and dictionaries similarly to how it handles other iterable objects (like lists and tuples).

From the test trace, we see that the `srepr` function calls `ReprPrinter.doprint(expr)` in the `sympy/printing/repr.py` file. Thus, modifying or observing `ReprPrinter` is the logical next step since this is likely where the `srepr` prints the structure but fails to handle sets and dictionaries correctly.

Let's observe the method where `srepr(expr, **settings)` is invoking its core functionality:

Observed method: `sympy/printing/repr.py:ReprPrinter.doprint`

To effectively generate a patch for the issue described, I need to retrieve the source code of the method `add_fields()` within the Django project file `django/forms/formsets.py`. This is because the patch involves modifying a conditional check within this method. Therefore, I will use the search API to locate and retrieve this method's source code.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/forms/formsets.py", "BaseFormSet.add_fields")
```

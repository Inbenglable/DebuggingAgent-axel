<ISSUE>
Incorrect parenthesizing of Subs
Here is an example.
```python
>>> from sympy import Subs
>>> from sympy.abc import x,y
>>> 3*Subs(-x+y, (x,),(1,))
```
LaTeX printing of this gives:  
```python
'3 \\left. - x + y \\right|_{\\substack{ x=1 }}'
```

It would be better to be parenthesized to:  
```python
'3 \\left. \\left(- x + y\\right) \\right|_{\\substack{ x=1 }}'
```

==================================================
Your Output:
To address the issue with incorrect parenthesizing in the LaTeX printing of `Subs` in Sympy, I need to locate the relevant method that handles LaTeX representation for the `Subs` class. This likely involves locating the `Subs` class and reviewing how it renders the LaTeX expressions. Therefore, it is necessary to search for the `Subs` class in the Sympy codebase initially.

Additionally, I presume that the implementation responsible for generating LaTeX output would be located within the `latex` method or a similar printing/utilities method. Thus, I will start by searching for the `Subs` class and then identify the method responsible for LaTeX rendering. This will enable me to review the current implementation and generate an appropriate patch.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Subs")
search_method_in_codebase("Subs._latex")
search_method_in_codebase("Subs.__latex__")
search_method_in_codebase("Subs.as_latex")
search_method_in_codebase("Subs._print_latex")
search_method_in_codebase("Subs._print_latex_expr")
search_method_in_codebase("_print_Subs")
```

Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_class_in_codebase("Subs")
RESULT:
#### sympy/core/function.py:Subs
```python
class Subs(Expr):
    """
    Represents unevaluated substitutions of an expression.

    ``Subs(expr, x, x0)`` receives 3 arguments: an expression, a variable or
    list of distinct variables and a point or list of evaluation points
    corresponding to those variables.

    ``Subs`` objects are generally useful to represent unevaluated derivatives
    calculated at a point.

    The variables may be expressions, but they are subjected to the limitations
    of subs(), so it is usually a good practice to use only symbols for
    variables, since in that case there can be no ambiguity.

    There's no automatic expansion - use the method .doit() to effect all
    possible substitutions of the object and also of objects inside the
    expression.

    When evaluating derivatives at a point that is not a symbol, a Subs object
    is returned. One is also able to calculate derivatives of Subs objects - in
    this case the expression is always expanded (for the unevaluated form, use
    Derivative()).

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Subs, Function, sin, cos
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z
    >>> f = Function('f')

    Subs are created when a particular substitution cannot be made. The
    x in the derivative cannot be replaced with 0 because 0 is not a
    valid variables of differentiation:

    >>> f(x).diff(x).subs(x, 0)
    Subs(Derivative(f(x), x), x, 0)

    Once f is known, the derivative and evaluation at 0 can be done:

    >>> _.subs(f, sin).doit() == sin(x).diff(x).subs(x, 0) == cos(0)
    True

    Subs can also be created directly with one or more variables:

    >>> Subs(f(x)*sin(y) + z, (x, y), (0, 1))
    Subs(z + f(x)*sin(y), (x, y), (0, 1))
    >>> _.doit()
    z + f(0)*sin(1)

    Notes
    =====

    In order to allow expressions to combine before doit is done, a
    representation of the Subs expression is used internally to make
    expressions that are superficially different compare the same:

    >>> a, b = Subs(x, x, 0), Subs(y, y, 0)
    >>> a + b
    2*Subs(x, x, 0)

    This can lead to unexpected consequences when using methods
    like `has` that are cached:

    >>> s = Subs(x, x, 0)
    >>> s.has(x), s.has(y)
    (True, False)
    >>> ss = s.subs(x, y)
    >>> ss.has(x), ss.has(y)
    (True, False)
    >>> s, ss
    (Subs(x, x, 0), Subs(y, y, 0))

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

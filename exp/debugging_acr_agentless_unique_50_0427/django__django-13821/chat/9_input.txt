<ISSUE>
Drop support for SQLite < 3.9.0
Description
	 
		(last modified by Tim Graham)
	 
Indexes on expressions (see #26167) and the SQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1 compile-time option are supported on ​SQLite 3.9.0+.
Ubuntu Xenial ships with SQLite 3.11.0 (which will still by supported by Django) and will EOL in April 2021. Debian Jessie ships with 3.8.7 and was EOL June 30, 2020.
SQLite 3.9.0 was released in October 2015. SQLite version support seems like a similar situation as GEOS libraries which we generally support about 5 years after released.

</ISSUE>


A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
Based on the provided information, the goal is to ensure that Django drops support for SQLite versions earlier than 3.9.0. The test script you provided is designed to check which SQLite version is being used by Django and raise an assertion if it is below 3.9.0. In the test output, the SQLite version used by Django is 3.47.2, which is greater than 3.9.0, so the check passes and the script outputs "SQLite version is 3.9.0 or higher. Issue is fixed."

The program behavior seems to function correctly because the SQLite version check is successful and the script exits with status 0, indicating no error. However, to ensure that the unsupported versions trigger an appropriate response (raising an `AssertionError`), we need to check if the condition for identifying a version below 3.9.0 is working as expected.

The main area of interest for locating a potential bug would be the method or location where the SQLite version checking logic is implemented.

The `check_sqlite_version()` function defined in the script is primarily responsible for this logic, as it fetches the SQLite version and compares it to 3.9.0. Let’s start by observing this method.

Observed method: `reproduce.py:check_sqlite_version`
==================================================
Based on the provided code and runtime information, let's analyze the abnormal behavior:

The `check_sqlite_version()` function checks the SQLite version used by Django by querying "SELECT sqlite_version();" and fetching the result. It then compares the version fetched to ensure it is not below 3.9.0. However, there's a potential error in the way the version is checked against the threshold of 3.9.0 (`sqlite3.sqlite_version_info < (3, 9, 0)`).

In the runtime information, it seems that there is an AssertionError occurring somewhere in the execution flow. This could imply that something about the way SQLite versions are initialized, set, or compared is not functioning as expected.

The logic for comparing versions seems suspect because `sqlite3.sqlite_version_info` actually refers to the compiled version of the `sqlite3` library itself, not necessarily reflecting the runtime version. This might cause inconsistency and lead to failures if the version string obtained from the SQL query doesn't match expectations.

Next steps:
Let's dig deeper into the specific line where the SQLite version comparison is performed, as there might be a discrepancy in how the version is being compared.

Observed scope: `reproduce.py:28-31`
==================================================
Analyzing the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior, the focus is on the comparison logic inside the `check_sqlite_version()` method. 

### Analysis:

The snippet `sqlite3.sqlite_version_info < (3, 9, 0)` is designed to compare the version of SQLite. However, this comparison uses the `sqlite3.sqlite_version_info`, which represents the version of the SQLite library that Python's `sqlite3` module is compiled against, not the actual runtime version that Django is using for its database operations. This discrepancy between the compiled version and the runtime database version may be causing inconsistency in the behavior.

The method currently raises an `AssertionError` if the condition evaluates to true. However, the mechanism for obtaining the runtime SQLite version through Django (`cursor.execute("SELECT sqlite_version();")`) is the correct way to fetch the version used by the database. The error seems to stem from the incorrect use and comparison with `sqlite3.sqlite_version_info`.

### Next Steps:

To accurately assess the SQLite version used by Django, the comparison should involve parsing the version string obtained from the SQL query executed: 

```python
cursor.execute("SELECT sqlite_version();")
sqlite_version = cursor.fetchone()[0]
```

Instead of checking `sqlite3.sqlite_version_info`, the version string `sqlite_version` should be appropriately parsed, converted into a tuple for comparison, and then compared against `(3, 9, 0)`.

### Decision:

The discrepancy in the version check suggests the `check_sqlite_version()` method is the buggy method that needs modification. 

Buggy method: `reproduce.py:check_sqlite_version`
==================================================

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To generate the appropriate patch, I need to review the source code of the `check_sqlite_version` method within the `reproduce.py` file. This will allow me to apply the necessary modifications for accurately checking the SQLite version used by Django.

I will proceed to search for the `check_sqlite_version` method in the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("reproduce.py", "check_sqlite_version")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_file("reproduce.py", "check_sqlite_version")
RESULT:
#### reproduce.py:check_sqlite_version
```python
def check_sqlite_version():
    from django.db import connection
    # Get the SQLite version used by Django
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT sqlite_version();")
    sqlite_version = cursor.fetchone()[0]
    print(f"SQLite version used by Django: {sqlite_version}")

    # Check if the SQLite version is less than 3.9.0
    if sqlite3.sqlite_version_info < (3, 9, 0):
        e = AssertionError(f"SQLite version {sqlite_version} is less than 3.9.0, which is not supported.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e

```


==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

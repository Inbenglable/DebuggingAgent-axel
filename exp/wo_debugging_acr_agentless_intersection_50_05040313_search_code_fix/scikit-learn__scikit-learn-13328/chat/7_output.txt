Let's review the patch and analyze the test outputs to determine whether the issue is fixed.

## Patch Review
### Patch Context
The patch modifies the `huber.py` file within the `sklearn/linear_model` directory.
- **Before Patch**: The data `X` is processed using the function `check_X_y`.
- **After Patch**: An additional step is introduced where `X` is explicitly converted to `float` using `X.astype(float)`. This ensures that the input `X` is of type `float`.

The patch addresses the problem directly by converting any boolean arrays passed to `HuberRegressor.fit` into float arrays, which fixes the issue since the problem was caused by a boolean array being mishandled.

## Test Output Analysis

### Original Output
- A `TypeError` is thrown with the message: "The numpy boolean negative, the `-` operator, is not supported, use the `~` operator or the logical_not function instead."
- The failure is captured by a test that raises an `AssertionError` indicating that `HuberRegressor` raised a `TypeError`.

### Patched Output
- The output simply states: "Issue is fixed."
- The absence of an exception or `AssertionError` indicates that the patch successfully resolved the problem.

## Conclusion
The patch effectively converts boolean arrays to float arrays, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring when fitting `HuberRegressor` with boolean predictors. The test output confirms that the issue is resolved as no error is thrown post-patch application.

Therefore, the issue is resolved.

Issue resolved: `True`

Upon reviewing the provided information, let's break down the analysis:

1. **Original Issue:**
   - The issue was that certain operations in `matplotlib` with arrays of datatype `uint8` were causing `DeprecationWarning` due to out-of-bound integer values starting from NumPy 1.24.

2. **Original Output:**
   - Before the patch, these warnings were indeed present, indicating the deprecation due to operations with out-of-bound values like 256, 257, and 258.

3. **Patch Details:**
   - The patch involves changes in handling integer values to avoid overflow issues that trigger warnings:
     - It uses `np.clip` to confine values within a valid range.
     - It replaces assignments that directly change values based on conditions with `np.where` to safely handle value replacement.
  
4. **Patched Output:**
   - After applying the patch, the same `DeprecationWarning` messages are still present in the output.
   - The `AssertionError` indicates that the deprecation warnings are still observed.

**Conclusion:**
- The patch appears to not resolve the issue because the warnings remain evident in the patched output just as it was in the original output. Despite attempts to use `np.clip` and `np.where`, the desired state of no warnings wasn't achieved.

Therefore, based on the presented analysis:

Issue resolved: `False`

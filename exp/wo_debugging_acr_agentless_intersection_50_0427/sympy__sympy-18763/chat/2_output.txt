To resolve the issue related to the LaTeX printing of the `Subs` class, I need to locate and examine the method that performs LaTeX conversion for `Subs` objects. This method is likely located in a file responsible for handling LaTeX or pretty printing in the sympy library.

### Next step:
I will investigate the codebase for a method that specifically deals with the `Subs` class's LaTeX or pretty-printing functionality. Given the typical structure of sympy, such methods are often found in printer modules or similar.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("_print_Subs")
```

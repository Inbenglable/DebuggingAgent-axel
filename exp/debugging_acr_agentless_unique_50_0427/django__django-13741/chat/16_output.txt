To proceed with generating the patch, I need to first retrieve the source code for the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` class in the `django/contrib/auth/forms.py` file. This will allow me to verify the existing implementation and make the necessary modifications to set the `disabled` property to `True` by default.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/contrib/auth/forms.py", "ReadOnlyPasswordHashField")
```

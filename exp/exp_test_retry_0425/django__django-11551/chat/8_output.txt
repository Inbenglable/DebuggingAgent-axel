The issue described in the Django project pertains to the validation logic within the `_check_list_display_item` function. The goal is to address the admin.E108 error by ensuring proper handling of field attributes in the list_display for the admin site.

### Patch Review
The patch modifies the `_check_list_display_item` function by:
- Removing the `hasattr(obj.model, item)` check.
- Ensuring both `get_field` and `getattr` checks are performed, and an admin.E108 error is raised only if both fail.
- It correctly queries attributes through `obj.model._meta.get_field(item)` and `getattr(obj.model, item)` as intended for resolving cases involving PositionField descriptors.

### Test Output Analysis

#### Original Output
The original output before applying the patch presents:
```
RuntimeError: Model class __main__.Thing doesn't declare an explicit app_label and isn't in an application in INSTALLED_APPS.
```
This indicates a configuration issue with the test setup, unrelated to the actual bug in Django's admin list_display validation logic.

#### Patched Output
After applying the patch, the test output remains the same:
```
RuntimeError: Model class __main__.Thing doesn't declare an explicit app_label and isn't in an application in INSTALLED_APPS.
```
This means the testing environment still encounters setup issues with the model's app_label and INSTALLED_APPS configuration, preventing the test from effectively verifying the specific bug resolution.

### Conclusion

Given the unchanged test output, the test failures seem to originate from setup/configuration problems rather than the code changes in `_check_list_display_item`. Without successfully executing the test for the correct condition, we cannot verify whether the patch effectively resolves the bug based on this output alone.

Therefore, based on the provided evidence:

Issue resolved: `False`

Upon analyzing the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior, the core issue seems to be related to the validation logic in the `_check_list_display_item` method.

### Analysis
- **Current Code:** The method checks if the item is callable, an attribute of `obj`, or an attribute of `obj.model`. If none of these conditions is met, it returns an error.
- **Issue Observed:** The problem arises because the logic incorrectly assumes that `hasattr(obj.model, item)` being false means `getattr()` will raise an `AttributeError`, without trying `field = obj.model._meta.get_field(item)` when `hasattr` is false for field names like `PositionField`.

### Abnormal Behavior
- **Error Overtriggering:** The logic throws `admin.E108` when `hasattr()` is false, even though a field retrieval via `_meta.get_field()` could bypass this.
- **Missing Module:** The `ModuleNotFoundError` experienced during the testing phase is separate from the actual issue but highlights missing setup for the test environment.

### Fix Approach
The patch suggestion in the issue involves altering the logic to attempt retrieving the field from `_meta.get_field()` even when `hasattr()` is false, handling `FieldDoesNotExist` exceptions instead.

Given this analysis, the buggy method has indeed been identified because the incorrect validation logic stems from `_check_list_display_item`.

**Buggy method:** `django/contrib/admin/checks.py:_check_list_display_item`

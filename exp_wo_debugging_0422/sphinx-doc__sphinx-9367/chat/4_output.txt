To address the issue, I need to retrieve the source code of the `visit_Tuple` method within the `_UnparseVisitor` class, as this method is responsible for handling tuple rendering. Since we have identified the file where `_UnparseVisitor` is defined, I'll proceed to retrieve the specific method's source code.

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/pycode/ast.py", "_UnparseVisitor.visit_Tuple")
```

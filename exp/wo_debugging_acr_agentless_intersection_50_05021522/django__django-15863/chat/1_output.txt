To address this issue, I need to inspect the code of the `floatformat` template filter. I will search for this method to understand and modify its behavior to handle `Decimal` numbers correctly.

I'll begin by locating the `floatformat` method within the Django codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("floatformat")
```

To resolve the issue, I first need to retrieve the source code for the `Axes.hexbin` method located in `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py`. This will allow me to inspect the current implementation and make the necessary modifications.

```python
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py", "Axes.hexbin")
```

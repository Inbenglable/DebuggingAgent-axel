To resolve the issue, I need to review the `floatformat` template filter's implementation in the Django codebase. This will help determine how it currently handles `Decimal` instances and why precision is being lost.

Given that the issue is with the `floatformat` filter, I should search for the method `floatformat` within the codebase. Since I do not yet know the file path, I will use the `search_method_in_codebase` API to find its implementation.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("floatformat")
```

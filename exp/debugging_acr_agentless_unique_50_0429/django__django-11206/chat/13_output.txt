To assess whether the issue is fixed, let's review the patch context and analyze the output from the test before and after applying the patch:

### Patch Review:
The patch changes the logic in `utils/numberformat.py` by modifying how very small numbers are formatted.

#### Patch Modifications:
1. **Condition Update**:
   ```python
   if abs(exponent) + len(digits) > 200
   ```
   is altered to:
   ```python
   if abs(exponent) + len(digits) > 200 and decimal_pos is None
   ```

   This change ensures that very small numbers won't automatically convert to scientific notation if the `decimal_pos` argument is explicitly provided.

2. **Formatting Logic**:
   ```python
   number = '{:e}'.format(number)
   ```
   is replaced with a conditional check and logic addition:
   ```python
   if decimal_pos is None:
       number = '{:e}'.format(number)
   else:
       str_number = '{:f}'.format(number)
   ```

   This replacement checks whether scientific notation formatting should be applied depending on whether `decimal_pos` is provided.

### Test Output Analysis:

#### Original Output:
- The test fails with an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception related to Django settings, which prevents the assertion checks and thus the evaluation of whether the format function works as intended.

#### Patched Output:
- The output after the patch continues to indicate the same `ImproperlyConfigured` exception. The test doesn't proceed to the relevant assertion checks or provide any results regarding the actual formatting logic changes.

### Conclusion:
The test error is due to Django settings configuration issues, and it persisted before and after applying the patch. This indicates that the patch's logic was not tested successfully because we cannot evaluate if the nformat function works as expected concerning the formatting of very small decimals with given decimal point specifications.

The issue related specifically to the handling of small decimals is not verifiable as resolved due to the setup error in the testing environment, which prevents proper execution of the test script.

Issue resolved: `False`

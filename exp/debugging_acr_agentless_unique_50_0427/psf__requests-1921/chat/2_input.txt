You need to trace the abnormal program to resolve project issues and submit pull requests.
Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **requests** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Removing a default header of a session
[The docs](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#session-objects) say that you can prevent sending a session header by setting the headers value to None in the method's arguments. You would expect (as [discussed on IRC](https://botbot.me/freenode/python-requests/msg/10788170/)) that this would work for session's default headers, too:

``` python
session = requests.Session()
# Do not send Accept-Encoding
session.headers['Accept-Encoding'] = None
```

What happens is that "None"  gets sent as the value of header.

```
Accept-Encoding: None
```

For the reference, here is a way that works:

``` python
del session.headers['Accept-Encoding']
```


</ISSUE>


Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
import requests

# Create a session
session = requests.Session()

# Try to remove Accept-Encoding header by setting it to None
session.headers['Accept-Encoding'] = None

# Make a request to see what headers are sent
r = session.get('http://httpbin.org/headers')
print(r.json())


This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
To analyze the abnormal behavior and identify why the `TypeError: expected string or bytes-like object` is occurring, let's trace through the process of setting the headers and making the request.

The problematic behavior arises from setting a header value to `None`. When this value is used during a request, it is not compatible with expectations of the underlying HTTP client, which expects a string or bytes-like object.

The execution trace shows the stack leading up to the error:
1. `session.get('http://httpbin.org/headers')` ends up calling `self.request('GET', url, **kwargs)`.
2. This leads to the `send` method in `requests.sessions.py`.
3. Following that, it delves into `requests.adapters.py` to `adapter.send(request, **kwargs)`.
4. Eventually, it reaches `urllib3.connectionpool.py`, and finally, the execution ends up in `http.client.py`, where the error arises due to the attempt to use a `None` value for a header.

The key observation is the handling of headers within the `session` and how it propagates to a point where a header value ends up being processed by the HTTP client.

Since setting a header value to `None` does not inherently remove it but instead leads to an invalid value passed downstream, the source resolution will need to be where headers are modified or read within the request process.

For this, locating where headers are handled during requests in the `requests.sessions` module is pivotal. Based on the anomaly, we need to inspect how headers are stored and manipulated through the process of building an HTTP request.

Further observation is necessary in:

Observed method: `requests/sessions.py:Session.request`

Now you choose downstream method Session.request to further observe, tracing the abnormal program behavior.

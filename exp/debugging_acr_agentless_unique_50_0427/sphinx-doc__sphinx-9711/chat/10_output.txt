The patch addresses the bug by changing the version comparison from a lexicographic string comparison to a numeric version comparison using the `packaging.version.parse` function. This change ensures that version numbers are compared correctly.

### Analysis:

- **Original Output**: The test originally failed because the version comparison was incorrect, treating '0.10.0' as less than '0.6.0' due to string comparison.

- **Patch**: The patch imports `packaging.version` and uses its `parse` method to compare versions numerically, which is the correct way to handle semantic versioning comparisons.

- **Patched Output**: The output is empty, indicating that no assertion error was raised and the test passed successfully. This suggests that the application no longer fails when a version like '0.10.0' is used against a required version of '0.6.0'.

### Conclusion:

The patch correctly fixes the issue by implementing a proper numeric comparison for version numbers. The test script, after applying the patch, runs without any errors, confirming that the bug is resolved.

Issue resolved: `True`

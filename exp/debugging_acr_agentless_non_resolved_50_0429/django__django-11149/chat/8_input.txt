Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Admin inlines for auto-created ManyToManyFields are editable if the user only has the view permission
Description
	
From https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/8060#comment:34
Replying to Will Gordon:
This seems to have regressed in (at least) 2.1. I have 2 view only permissions. I have a ManyToManyField represented in my main model as a TabularInline. But, my user with view only permissions can now add or remove these items at will!
I am having the same issue, so I assume this is a bug. I did not find Will had created a separate ticket.
models.py:
class Photo(models.Model):
	pass
class Report(models.Model):
	photos = models.ManyToManyField(Photo)
admin.py:
		class ReportPhotoInlineModelAdmin(admin.TabularInline):
			model = Report.photos.through
			show_change_link = True

This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
The issue here is that the test script is encountering an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception due to attempting to access Django settings before they are properly configured. Specifically, the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting is requested, but the framework is not fully set up due to missing configurations.

Examining the test script:
1. The script begins by importing several Django modules and configuring settings with `settings.configure`.
2. However, the error indicates that `settings.configure()` is not correctly being applied before accessing Django functionalities that require these settings, such as importing models from `django.contrib.auth`.

The immediate problem is happening because the `settings.configure()` command cannot be used to fully simulate a Django environment, especially when using Django's app registry. Proper Django initialization requires setting an environment variable or using a settings module that Django's `manage.py` script would typically handle.

In order to resolve this, I need to ensure that Django is initialized properly in the testing environment. This involves ensuring that apps are ready when models are accessed.

Based on the traceback, since the code encountered the error at:
```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User, Permission
```

The test setup should ensure Django apps are ready before reaching this import. However, since the setup seems incorrect, let's focus on the proper initialization.

Observed method: `django/conf/__init__.py:_setup`
==================================================
The traceback indicates that the program encountered an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception due to the Django settings module not being configured properly. The specific issue occurs when the script attempts to access `INSTALLED_APPS` early in the execution process, particularly when models from `django.contrib.auth` are being imported, which triggers Django's app registry setup. This setup requires the settings module to be configured.

When tracing the call to `LazySettings._setup`, we see that the environment variable `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is not set, and `settings.configure()` seems ineffective in this context because the test setup is not correctly initializing the Django environment to allow for app configurations to be accessed safely.

From this analysis, the problem seems rooted in the initialization phase of the script where the Django environment is inadequately set up, indicated by failed access to `django.contrib.auth.models` due to `INSTALLED_APPS` being required beforehand.

To pinpoint the exact code location, I will need to further inspect how Django's settings are being interacted with before reaching the point of inadequate setup. Given this examination, the focus should be on how and where setup should ensure the settings are fully prepared before further access.

Therefore, my next step is to inspect how settings are managed before imports and ensure configurations are handled effectively in the function that attempts these imports.

Observed scope: `django/conf/__init__.py:49-62`
==================================================
Analyzing the current observations and abnormal program behavior, the root cause appears to be related to improper configuration of Django settings before accessing certain functionalities that depend on these settings. Specifically, the error occurs when attempting to access "`INSTALLED_APPS`" as part of the Django imports, triggering the `LazySettings._setup` method. The traceback and runtime details indicate that the environment variable `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is not set, causing the settings to remain unconfigured.

The abnormal behavior points out that the `settings.configure()` call is not sufficient in this context, because it seems to be executed after attempts to access settings-related functionality that require proper initialization, likely indicated by the failing import of `django.contrib.auth.models`.

To fix this, there should be an initial setup that either properly defines the required environment variable or ensures that the settings are configured at a point in execution that precedes the dependent import statements.

Thus, we need to ensure the Django settings are fundamentally configured before any imports that require them are executed, particularly concerning the app registry setup.

Since current tracing points toward the necessity of proper sequence in defining the settings environment before the test execution proceeds, and considering the `LazySettings._setup` method is central to the initialization check, a logical next step is to further inspect the process that leads up to the configuration access, ensuring proper setup is respected.

Since we've reached a method that highlights an initialization issue, I will proceed with observing the process leading up to this improper setting access to locate where configuration guarantees are bypassed:

Observed method: `django/conf/__init__.py:LazySettings.__getattr__`
==================================================
Current observations show that the issue stems from improper initialization of Django settings, leading to an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception. The `LazySettings.__getattr__` method is invoked when trying to access the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting before the settings module is fully configured. This indicates that the setup sequence is not correctly ensuring the configuration of Django settings before dependent modules are accessed.

The traceback details indicate that imports triggering the use of settings, such as `django.contrib.auth.models`, cause a failure due to the settings not being ready, as seen from the call to `LazySettings._setup(name)` which raises the exception.

### Strategy for Resolution:
Initialization should ensure settings are configured before making imports that depend on them. In a typical Django project, this is managed by `manage.py` or by setting the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable, which is missing or improperly set in the test script leading to this behavior.

**Next Step:**
Understand why and where settings are being accessed before they are configured in the test script, focusing on the call to `LazySettings._setup(name)` due to `INSTALLED_APPS`:

### Next Observation:
To isolate the step causing improper configuration in `LazySettings`, inspect how `LazySettings._setup()` is interacted with as outlined in the call to `LazySettings.__getattr__`.

Proceed by examining the relevant code section where Django settings setup is expected to be correctly configured or where the settings module setup fails to initialize:

#### Focused Code Analysis:
Observed scope: `django/conf/__init__.py:59-62`
==================================================
The current observed code snippet encapsulates the ImproperlyConfigured exception in the `LazySettings.__getattr__` method. This method is invoked when trying to access "INSTALLED_APPS," but settings are not configured due to the absence of either the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable or a `settings.configure()` call being executed appropriately.

In the runtime information provided, it's clear that:

- `settings_module` is `None`, indicating the settings module was not set.
- The exception is raised because of an improper setup before accessing settings that are expected to be configured.

This is a classic case where Django applications expect the settings to be ready and configured before the app registry attempts to load models or other components. The initialization phase is skipped or improperly handled before accessing the `INSTALLED_APPS` configuration, causing the exception.

Given this analysis, the problem is evident in the improper configuration setup:
- The ImproperlyConfigured exception arises due to missing setup, highlighting a need to fix the sequence of actions leading up to accessing Django's settings.

### Conclusion:
The issue likely lies around the initial setup or configuration phase within the testing script. The absence of proper setup logic, such as defining the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` or properly configuring settings, is evident.

However, the current code observed does not contain the actual bug related to the ManyToManyField issue originally reported. The traceback points to the improper initialization logic, not directly to the ManyToMany permissions handling issue.

### Decision:
The next step is to trace deeper into the location where initialization is supposed to occur before settings are accessed, ensuring the setup makes Django's environment ready for imports and app registry operations.

Thus, to correctly pinpoint where the configuration setup is occurring or should be occurring, and where the ManyToManyField handling should affect permissions, I will need to trace the execution further by observing the setup process within `LazySettings` that allows proper import.

Observed method: `django/conf/__init__.py:_setup`
==================================================
From the analysis provided, the main issue currently observed relates to the improper setup of Django's settings in the testing script, particularly highlighted in the `LazySettings._setup` method. The error arises when attempting to access `INSTALLED_APPS` before Django settings are fully configured, leading to an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception. The runtime details reinforce that the settings module is not correctly initialized, indicated by `settings_module = None`.

Given the tracing of the abnormal behavior, this initialization issue prevents the test for auto-created `ManyToManyFields` permissions from even reaching execution effectively. Thus, while not directly pointing to the specific ManyToMany handling code, a fundamentally faulty setup causes a failure before reaching the permissions testing logic.

Upon examining the initialization step where settings access occurs without proper preparation:

### Immediate Resolution Point:
Focus should be on ensuring proper environment setup before accessing settings. This involves setting the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable or ensuring configurations with `settings.configure()` are correctly applied prior to the use of any settings-dependent imports.

Thus, the initial bug lies in the test script's setup procedure, which should either define the environment variable or invoke proper configuration setup earlier in the script execution.

### Next Steps and Deeper Inspection:
To further diagnose the issue rooted in permissions related to auto-created ManyToManyFields, I need to confirm proper setup and then trace the logic where permission checks might be failing once initialization issues are resolved:

Proceed tracing into the section ensuring setup before the error call to verify appropriate configuration:
- Inspect the trace further for the step ensuring Django's initialization before reaching the point of failure.

#### I will observe deeper in the setup process as indicated:
Observed scope: `django/conf/__init__.py:54-62`
==================================================


Now you choose LazySettings._setup's code snippet 
    54	        settings_module = os.environ.get(ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE)
    55	        if not settings_module:
    56	            desc = ("setting %s" % name) if name else "settings"
    57	            raise ImproperlyConfigured(
    58	                "Requested %s, but settings are not configured. "
    59	                "You must either define the environment variable %s "
    60	                "or call settings.configure() before accessing settings."

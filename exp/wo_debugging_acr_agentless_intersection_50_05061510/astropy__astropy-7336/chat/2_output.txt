To resolve the issue, we need to understand how the `units.quantity_input` decorator is implemented, specifically the part where it handles the return value of functions. We should search for the method that applies this decoration and performs operations based on the return value. The error message points to a function within `astropy.utils.decorators.py`. 

Let's search for the relevant method in the `astropy/units/decorators.py`, as this is where the error seems to occur according to the error trace.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/units/decorators.py", "quantity_input")
```

I have located the `_print_Subs` method in `sympy/printing/latex.py`, which is responsible for producing the LaTeX output for the `Subs` class. To resolve the issue of incorrect parenthesizing, I need to modify this method to ensure the expression is appropriately parenthesized.

Before proceeding to generate the patch, I'll need to retrieve the source code of the `_print_Subs` method in `sympy/printing/latex.py` to analyze it and make necessary modifications.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/latex.py", "LatexPrinter._print_Subs")
```

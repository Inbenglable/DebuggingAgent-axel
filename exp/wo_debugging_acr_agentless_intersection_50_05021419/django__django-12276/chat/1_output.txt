To generate the patch for the issue described, I need to retrieve the source code of the `ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute()` method first. Since I know the file path, I will use the search API to find the method's implementation.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute")
search_method_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "FileInput.use_required_attribute")
search_class_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "ClearableFileInput")
search_class_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "FileInput")
```

## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Removing a default header of a session
[The docs](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#session-objects) say that you can prevent sending a session header by setting the headers value to None in the method's arguments. You would expect (as [discussed on IRC](https://botbot.me/freenode/python-requests/msg/10788170/)) that this would work for session's default headers, too:

``` python
session = requests.Session()
# Do not send Accept-Encoding
session.headers['Accept-Encoding'] = None
```

What happens is that "None"  gets sent as the value of header.

```
Accept-Encoding: None
```

For the reference, here is a way that works:

``` python
del session.headers['Accept-Encoding']
```

In the previous round, you called search APIs to retrieve relevant source code that would help identify the root cause of the issue and generate a patch. However, the code you retrieved appears in multiple locations (maybe some are irrelevant but have same key). So now your task is to determine which of the retrieved contents are indeed you need, and filter out the irrelevant ones.
This is your API invocation round output:
To resolve the issue, I need to identify where the handling of session headers is implemented within the requests library. Specifically, this functionality is likely related to the `Session` class, potentially in the method that initializes or processes headers. 

I'll start by searching for the `Session` class to find its location, followed by closely checking its methods for any header manipulation.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Session")
```

And this is the corresponding API returned result (each content is started with #### FILE_PATH:NAME):

Among the API returned contents, there may be some irrelevant ones or not. So now you need to analyze each returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.
Now, please first analyze the API returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.

Then you need to choose you needed ones with the following format:
```
FILE_PATH_1:NAME_1
FILE_PATH_2:NAME_2
...
```

Note:
1. The value of FILE_PATH:NAME, must consistent with the API returned content (but remove the prefix ####).
2. You may select one or more contents, or even all of them if they are indeed you need.

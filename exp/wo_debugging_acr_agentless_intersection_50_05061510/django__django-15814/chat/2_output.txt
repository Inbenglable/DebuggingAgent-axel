In the context provided, we have enough information regarding the issue location and its potential resolution. The problematic line is related to retrieving metadata from the current model, and the suggested implementation involves accessing the concrete model's metadata instead. This indicates that a fix would involve a minor adjustment pertaining to proxy model awareness in the query construction process.

Given the snippet retrieved, it seems we understand the logic and context in which `opts = cur_model._meta` is set. I do not require further code retrieval, as the extent of the surrounding logic is sufficient to inform a change. It's important, however, to ensure no other parts of this file excessively rely on a direct use of metadata without considering proxy behavior. Yet, due to the scope and impact understanding, I can proceed with a patch.

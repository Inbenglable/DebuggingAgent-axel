To address the issue, I need to look at the `RenameContentType._rename()` method located within the file `django/contrib/contenttypes/management/__init__.py`. Specifically, I need to verify how the `content_type.save()` method is being called and ensure that it uses the correct database parameter. I will search for the `RenameContentType` class and its `_rename` method in the specified file.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/contrib/contenttypes/management/__init__.py", "RenameContentType")
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/contenttypes/management/__init__.py", "RenameContentType._rename")
```

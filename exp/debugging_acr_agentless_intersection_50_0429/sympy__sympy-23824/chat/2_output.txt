To address the issue, I need to examine the source code of the `kahane_simplify` method in the specified file within the `sympy` project codebase. This will allow us to understand the buggy logic and subsequently generate a patch to rectify it.

Since the debugging history has pointed out the file in question as `sympy/physics/hep/gamma_matrices.py`, I'll proceed to search for the method within this file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/physics/hep/gamma_matrices.py", "kahane_simplify")
```

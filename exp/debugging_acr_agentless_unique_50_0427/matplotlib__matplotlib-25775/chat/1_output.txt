Based on the error message provided, the `Text` object from the `matplotlib` library is missing the methods `set_antialiased` and `get_antialiased`. Therefore, the issue clearly stems from the fact that these methods do not exist for `Text` objects.

To address this problem, we will need to define these methods within the `Text` class. The goal is to allow `Text` objects to have individual antialiasing states, much like other elements within the `matplotlib` library.

To understand where the `Text` objects are defined and where to add these methods, I need to inspect the `Text` class.

Observed method: `lib/matplotlib/text.py:Text.__init__`

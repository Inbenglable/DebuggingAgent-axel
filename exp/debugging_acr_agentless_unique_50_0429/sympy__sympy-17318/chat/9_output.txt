To resolve the issue with `IndexError` in the `_split_gcd` function of the `sympy` library, we should modify the `_split_gcd` function to handle empty input gracefully. Specifically, we want to check if the input list `a` is empty and return default values that indicate no splitting is possible. This will prevent the `IndexError` when `a[0]` is accessed.

Let's create the necessary search/replace format patch for this:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/simplify/radsimp.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ng = a[0]\n=======\n    if not a:\n        return 1, [], []\n    g = a[0]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation:
- **SEARCH:** We're looking for the line `g = a[0]` which causes an `IndexError` if `a` is empty.
- **REPLACE:** Before accessing `a[0]`, we introduce a check for emptiness with `if not a:` and handle this by returning `(1, [], [])`. This indicates there is no meaningful gcd (using 1 as the neutral element for gcd), and both lists are empty, which aligns with not being able to split the gcd among empty inputs.

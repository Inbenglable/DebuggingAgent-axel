CountVectorizer's get_feature_names raise not NotFittedError when the vocabulary parameter is provided
If you initialize a `CounterVectorizer` and try to perform a transformation without training you will get a `NotFittedError` exception.

```python
In [1]: from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
In [2]: vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
In [3]: corpus = [
    ...:     'This is the first document.',
    ...:     'This is the second second document.',
    ...:     'And the third one.',
    ...:     'Is this the first document?',
    ...: ]

In [4]: vectorizer.transform(corpus)
NotFittedError: CountVectorizer - Vocabulary wasn't fitted.
```
On the other hand if you provide the `vocabulary` at the initialization of the vectorizer you could transform a corpus without a prior training, right?

```python
In [1]: from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

In [2]: vectorizer = CountVectorizer()

In [3]: corpus = [
    ...:     'This is the first document.',
    ...:     'This is the second second document.',
    ...:     'And the third one.',
    ...:     'Is this the first document?',
    ...: ]

In [4]: vocabulary = ['and', 'document', 'first', 'is', 'one', 'second', 'the', 'third', 'this']

In [5]: vectorizer = CountVectorizer(vocabulary=vocabulary)

In [6]: hasattr(vectorizer, "vocabulary_")
Out[6]: False

In [7]: vectorizer.get_feature_names()
NotFittedError: CountVectorizer - Vocabulary wasn't fitted.

In [8]: vectorizer.transform(corpus)
Out[8]:
<4x9 sparse matrix of type '<class 'numpy.int64'>'
        with 19 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Row format>

In [9]: hasattr(vectorizer, "vocabulary_")
Out[9]: True
```

The `CountVectorizer`'s `transform` calls `_validate_vocabulary` method which sets the `vocabulary_` instance variable.

In the same manner I believe that the `get_feature_names` method should not raise `NotFittedError` if the vocabulary parameter is provided but the vectorizer has not been trained.

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
The issue stems from the behavior of the `get_feature_names` method in the `CountVectorizer` class when a vocabulary is explicitly provided during initialization. When the vocabulary parameter is given, the `vocabulary_` attribute should be considered as set, allowing `get_feature_names` to return the feature names without raising a `NotFittedError`.

Analyzing the runtime information and the traceback suggests that the call to `self._check_vocabulary()` within the `get_feature_names` method checks for the existence of the `vocabulary_` attribute. However, the `vocabulary_` attribute seems not to be set until after a `transform` operation is performed, even if a vocabulary is supplied during initialization.

Let's trace the method call further to pinpoint why the vocabulary-related logic is insufficient when manually setting a vocabulary. 

Observed method: `sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py:CountVectorizer._check_vocabulary`
==================================================
The current issue arises because the `get_feature_names` method raises a `NotFittedError` when the `vocabulary` is provided at initialization, even though theoretically it should have been considered "fitted". 

In the method `VectorizerMixin._check_vocabulary`, we see that it uses `check_is_fitted(self, 'vocabulary_')` to ensure that the vectorizer is considered fitted. However, if a vocabulary is provided directly, this method will still fail unless something like `transform` is called beforehand, which sets the `vocabulary_` attribute. Normally, when a vocabulary is provided at initialization, the `vocabulary_` should be set directly.

To resolve this, we need to ensure that when a vocabulary is provided during initialization, the `vocabulary_` attribute should be set immediately, thereby considering the vectorizer as fitted.

Given the information and the analysis, it seems the potential adjustment should occur during the initialization or directly in methods that set the vocabulary.

I would like to further inspect the initialization process in the `CountVectorizer` class to verify if the vocabulary is properly set when provided. This would include where the vocabulary is assigned and how attributes like `vocabulary_` are handled.

Let's trace the initialization process. I would like to observe:

Observed scope: `sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py:210-250`
==================================================
The current traceback suggests that the problem originates from the `_check_vocabulary` method in the `VectorizerMixin` class. The runtime error indicates that `check_is_fitted(self, 'vocabulary_')` fails because the `vocabulary_` attribute is not considered to be set, even though a `vocabulary` was provided during initialization.

To resolve this issue, it would be necessary to delve deeper into how the `vocabulary_` attribute is managed during the initialization process of `CountVectorizer`. This involves ensuring that when the `vocabulary` parameter is given, the `vocabulary_` attribute should be properly assigned, which would prevent the `NotFittedError`.

Based on the analysis, I need to trace the initialization process in the `CountVectorizer` class to determine where and why `vocabulary_` is not assigned properly.

Observed method: `sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py:CountVectorizer.__init__`
==================================================
From the analysis performed so far, we know that the issue occurs because the `get_feature_names` method raises a `NotFittedError` when the vocabulary is provided at initialization. The observation of `CountVectorizer.__init__` shows that the `vocabulary` parameter, when provided, does get assigned to `self.vocabulary` but not immediately to `self.vocabulary_`. This is why the `check_is_fitted(self, 'vocabulary_')` check fails in `_check_vocabulary`.

The issue likely lies in the method responsible for setting or validating the vocabulary properly, especially when provided directly. Since no code presently links the `vocabulary` parameter directly to `vocabulary_` during initialization, it seems evident that the setup or transformation method might be not considering the vocabulary parameter fully as intended.

Based on this analysis, our next step should be to trace the method where the vocabulary should be validated or where `vocabulary_` should be assigned, just after initialization if `vocabulary` is provided.

To locate the underlying problem, I should check the method that handles vocabulary validation or checking logic, typically during the vectorizer operations (like fitting or transformation), apart from initialization. Considering the traceback, `_check_vocabulary` is crucial as it checks for the `vocabulary_`. Therefore, I want to ensure that vocabulary setup covers cases where it's provided directly.

Observed scope: `sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py:300-320`
==================================================
Based on the analysis and the observed behavior, we understand that the issue is arising because the `vocabulary_` attribute is not being set when the `vocabulary` parameter is provided during initialization of `CountVectorizer`. The `_check_vocabulary` method is called by `get_feature_names` and checks whether the `vocabulary_` attribute is set, which fails and raises a `NotFittedError`.

This indicates that the problem lies in the process of linking the `vocabulary` parameter to the `vocabulary_` attribute without requiring an explicit call like `transform`. The initialization or validation method should handle this linkage but currently does not.

Let's continue tracing by selecting the method that handles vocabulary validation or setting in the `CountVectorizer` class, which is `_validate_vocabulary`.

Observed method: `sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py:VectorizerMixin._validate_vocabulary`
==================================================
Based on the analysis and the provided runtime information, the issue is associated with the `get_feature_names` method in the `CountVectorizer` class of the `scikit-learn` library. When a vocabulary is explicitly provided upon initialization, the `vocabulary_` attribute should be directly set, making the vectorizer "fitted" in terms of vocabulary presence.

Here's what's happening:

1. The `vocabulary` is provided during the initialization of `CountVectorizer`, but the method does not immediately assign it to `vocabulary_`.
2. The `_validate_vocabulary` method, when called, should ideally ensure `vocabulary_` is set for provided vocabularies but requires an active call (like `fit` or `transform`) to execute this condition.
3. Because `_check_vocabulary` uses `check_is_fitted(self, 'vocabulary_')`, it expects `vocabulary_` to be always set for the vectorizer to be "ready", but currently, this condition only becomes true after operations like `transform`.

In our trace, `_validate_vocabulary` correctly sets `vocabulary_` during calls when `vocabulary` is provided, indicating where an initialization adjustment is needed post instantiation.

Given these insights, we aim to correct this issue by ensuring `vocabulary_` is appropriately set during initialization if `vocabulary` is given.

Thus, the buggy method is determined to be:

Buggy method: `sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py:CountVectorizer.__init__`

To fix: We need to directly assign `vocabulary` to `vocabulary_` in the constructor of `CountVectorizer` or validate it early enough without needing intermediate transformations.
==================================================


Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

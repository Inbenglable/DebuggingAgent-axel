To address the issue with the `astropy` package, we need to retrieve the source code of the `identify_format` method to understand its implementation. Additionally, we should check the `is_fits` function in the file `astropy/io/fits/connect.py` where the error occurs. This will help us determine how to prevent the `IndexError`.

Let's proceed by retrieving the source code of `identify_format` and `is_fits`.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("identify_format")
search_method_in_file("astropy/io/fits/connect.py", "is_fits")
```

To resolve the issue with username validation in Django, we need to change the regular expressions used in the `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` classes. Both validators currently use a regex pattern that allows trailing newlines due to the use of the `$` anchor. We'll replace it with `\A` and `\Z` to ensure trailing newlines are not allowed.

Here's the patch in the *SEARCH/REPLACE* format:

```pythony
### django/contrib/auth/validators.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    regex = r'^[\w.@+-]+$'
=======
    regex = r'\A[\w.@+-]+\Z'
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

With this patch, we are replacing the regex pattern in both `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` to use `\A` and `\Z`.

Here is the JSON representation of the search and replace edits:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/auth/validators.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    regex = r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'\n=======\n    regex = r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

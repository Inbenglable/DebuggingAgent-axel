To address the issue, I need to examine the source code of the `_wrap_in_pandas_container` method in the `sklearn/utils/_set_output.py` file. This will allow me to understand how the data frames are currently being created, and then modify the method to preserve the original dtypes of the input data when casting to a pandas DataFrame.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/utils/_set_output.py", "_wrap_in_pandas_container")
```

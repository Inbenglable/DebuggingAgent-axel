The issue at hand involves rendering a 1-element tuple correctly in the **sphinx** project. The test case provided fails to execute due to an `ImportError`. The error message indicates that the module `sphinx.pycode.ast` does not contain a function or class named `ast2commentedcode`, or the function is not publicly accessible from this module.

By analyzing this information, there are two possibilities to explore:
1. The functionality for converting an AST into commented code may reside elsewhere, possibly under a different name or module.
2. It wasn't implemented or properly exposed as suggested by the erroneous import statement `from sphinx.pycode.ast import ast2commentedcode`.

To identify the location of this functionality or to verify its absence, we need to examine the module `sphinx.pycode.ast` and its adjacent implementation or documentation.

Observed method: `sphinx/pycode/ast.py`

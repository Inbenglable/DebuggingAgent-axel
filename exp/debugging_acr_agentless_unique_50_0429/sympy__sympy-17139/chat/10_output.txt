The error in the `_TR56` function is due to the improper comparison of complex numbers. To resolve this issue, I can amend the code to avoid such illegal comparisons. I have obtained the source code for the `_TR56` function and have a clear understanding of the problem. I can proceed to generate the patch to fix the issue.

Ready generation: `True`

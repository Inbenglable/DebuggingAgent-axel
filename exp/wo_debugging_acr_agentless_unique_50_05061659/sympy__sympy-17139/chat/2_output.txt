To address the issue, we need to investigate how the comparison of complex numbers is handled in the `TR6` and `_TR56` functions in `fu.py`. This requires understanding the internal logic of these methods.

To make the necessary modifications, we'll start by retrieving the source code for the `TR6` and `_TR56` methods from the `fu.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/simplify/fu.py", "TR6")
search_method_in_file("sympy/simplify/fu.py", "_TR56")
```

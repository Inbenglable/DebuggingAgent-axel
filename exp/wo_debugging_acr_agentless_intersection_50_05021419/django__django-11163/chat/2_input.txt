## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
model_to_dict() should return an empty dict for an empty list of fields.
Description
	
Been called as model_to_dict(instance, fields=[]) function should return empty dict, because no fields were requested. But it returns all fields
The problem point is
if fields and f.name not in fields:
which should be
if fields is not None and f.name not in fields:

</ISSUE>


You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue, I need to examine the code of the `model_to_dict` function within the Django project. Since I don't have the file path for this method, I will search for it in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("model_to_dict")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("model_to_dict")
RESULT:
#### django/forms/models.py:model_to_dict
```python
def model_to_dict(instance, fields=None, exclude=None):
    """
    Return a dict containing the data in ``instance`` suitable for passing as
    a Form's ``initial`` keyword argument.

    ``fields`` is an optional list of field names. If provided, return only the
    named.

    ``exclude`` is an optional list of field names. If provided, exclude the
    named from the returned dict, even if they are listed in the ``fields``
    argument.
    """
    opts = instance._meta
    data = {}
    for f in chain(opts.concrete_fields, opts.private_fields, opts.many_to_many):
        if not getattr(f, 'editable', False):
            continue
        if fields and f.name not in fields:
            continue
        if exclude and f.name in exclude:
            continue
        data[f.name] = f.value_from_object(instance)
    return data

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

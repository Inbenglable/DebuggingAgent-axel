Upon reviewing the patch and analyzing the test outputs before and after its application:

1. **Patch Review:**
   - The modification introduces a check for `has_add_permission` in the `show_save_as_new` logic within the `submit_row` function. The patch is consistent with the suggested solution in the issue description.

2. **Test Output Analysis:**
   - **Original Output:** 
     - Test case 1 fails because "Save as new" is displayed even when the user lacks add permission.
     - Test case 2 passes since "Save as new" appears when the user has both change and add permissions.
     - Test case 3 passes as "Save as new" is correctly hidden when `save_as` is False.

   - **Patched Output:**
     - Test case 1 now passes, indicating that "Save as new" is correctly hidden when the user lacks add permission.
     - Test case 2 continues to pass, showing "Save as new" correctly when the user has both change and add permissions.
     - Test case 3 continues to pass, indicating "Save as new" is hidden when `save_as` is False.

The patched output confirms that the logic change successfully fixes the issue described. The addition of the add permission check aligns with the expected behavior, resolving the problem reported in the issue.

Therefore, the issue is resolved: `True`.

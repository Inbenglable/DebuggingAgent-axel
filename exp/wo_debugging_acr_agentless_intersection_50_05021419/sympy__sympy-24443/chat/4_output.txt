To address the issue, we need to review and analyze the `_image` function within the Sympy project's `homomorphisms.py` file, as it has been identified as the source of the error. First, I will look at the `_image` method code to understand how it operates, especially when dealing with `PermutationGroup`.

Since I'll need this method to generate the patch, I will retrieve its source code using the appropriate search API.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py", "_image")
```

You are a PR reviewer that needs to review the patch generated by a bug repair agent and determine whether the issue is fixed or not.
This is the bug issue, which is in the **astropy** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
InheritDocstrings metaclass doesn't work for properties
Inside the InheritDocstrings metaclass it uses `inspect.isfunction` which returns `False` for properties.

</ISSUE>


Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
## REPRODUCE TEST
```
import inspect
import traceback
import sys
from astropy.utils.misc import InheritDocstrings

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

class Base(metaclass=InheritDocstrings):
    def method(self):
        """This is the method docstring."""
        pass

    @property
    def prop(self):
        """This is the property docstring."""
        return 42

class Derived(Base):
    def method(self):
        pass

    @property
    def prop(self):
        pass

def main():
    # Check if the method docstring is inherited
    assert Derived.method.__doc__ == "This is the method docstring.", "Method docstring not inherited."

    # Check if the property docstring is inherited
    try:
        assert Derived.prop.__doc__ == "This is the property docstring.", "Property docstring not inherited."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

And this is the original output when running the test (before applying the patch):
## ORIGINAL OUTPUT
```

The repair agent has tried to generate a patch to fix the issue:
## PATCH CONTEXT
<PATCH_CONTEXT>
To resolve the issue, we need to update the `InheritDocstrings.__init__` method to support properties by correctly identifying them and inheriting their docstrings. This requires modifying the current implementation where `inspect.isfunction` is used, and adding support for detecting properties, likely using `inspect.isdatadescriptor`. Here's the patch:

```pythony
### astropy/utils/misc.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            if (inspect.isfunction(val) and
=======
            if ((inspect.isfunction(val) or inspect.isdatadescriptor(val)) and
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change will allow the metaclass to check for both functions and properties, thus inheriting docstrings for properties as well.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### astropy/utils/misc.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            if (inspect.isfunction(val) and\n=======\n            if ((inspect.isfunction(val) or inspect.isdatadescriptor(val)) and\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```
</PATCH_CONTEXT>

After applying the patch, the output of the test is:
## PATCHED OUTPUT
```

```

Now, please first review the patch and analyse the test output before and after the patch, to determine whether the issue is fixed or not.

And finally, tell me whether the issue is fixed or not by replying with:
Issue resolved: `True/False`

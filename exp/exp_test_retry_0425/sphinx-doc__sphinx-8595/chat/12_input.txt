Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
## REPRODUCE TEST
```
import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))

project = 'Test'
copyright = '2023'
author = 'Test'

extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc']
```

And this is the original output when running the test (before applying the patch):
## ORIGINAL OUTPUT
```

```

The repair agent has tried to generate a patch to fix the issue:
## PATCH CONTEXT
<PATCH_CONTEXT>
To resolve the issue regarding the handling of an empty `__all__` attribute in the `get_object_members` method of the `ModuleDocumenter` class, I will modify the logic so that when `__all__` is empty, no members are documented. The fix involves changing the conditional block responsible for processing when `__all__` is empty.

Here is the patch to apply the necessary changes:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                return True, list(members.values())\n=======\n                return False, []\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This change ensures that when `__all__` is empty, the method returns no members instead of all members, addressing the reported bug.
</PATCH_CONTEXT>

After applying the patch, the output of the test is:
## PATCHED OUTPUT
```

```

Now, please first review the patch and analyse the test output before and after the patch, to determine whether the issue is fixed or not.

And finally, tell me whether the issue is fixed or not by replying with:
Issue resolved: `True/False`

Based on the traceback provided, the error occurs because `min_samples` is not converted from a float to an integer before it's used as a parameter in the `NearestNeighbors` class. The relevant part of the stack trace is in the `OPTICS.fit` function, which calls `compute_optics_graph`. 

The specific passage in the issue description already identifies the problematic code:

```python
if min_samples <= 1:
    min_samples = max(2, min_samples * n_samples)  # Still a float
```

Given this information, we can directly locate the buggy method.

Buggy method: `sklearn/cluster/optics_.py:compute_optics_graph`

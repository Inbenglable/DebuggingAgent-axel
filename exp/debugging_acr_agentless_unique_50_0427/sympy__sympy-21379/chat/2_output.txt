To start diagnosing the issue, we should first inspect the execution path leading to the `PolynomialError`. Based on the code involved in the error, it most likely relates to the execution path when substitutions occur alongside specific function compositions like `exp`, `sinh`, and `Piecewise`.

Let's begin by examining the method that triggers the `PolynomialError` during the substitution process when the expression involves `Piecewise`. The method responsible for handling substitutions in expressions is typically linked to `Expr.subs` or methods dealing with symbolic manipulations involving polynomials.

Next, it is essential to analyze how the polynomial tools interact with `Piecewise` expressions because the error message "Piecewise generators do not make sense" suggests an issue with polynomial generation from a `Piecewise` expression. Thus, the focus should be on methods invoked within `subs` that attempt polynomial manipulations.

To resolve the issue with the `floatformat()` function, we need to ensure that the precision `prec` is never set to a value lower than 1, which is required by the `Context` used in the `quantize()` method. This can be achieved by adjusting the `prec` calculation to guarantee a minimum value of 1.

Here's the patch that applies the necessary changes:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/template/defaultfilters.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    prec = abs(p) + units + 1\n=======\n    prec = max(abs(p) + units + 1, 1)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch ensures that the `prec` value is always at least 1, thus preventing the `ValueError`. The change will not affect other calculations since the minimum precision should logically be 1 when formatting floats.

Based on the provided API returned results, we need to determine which functions are relevant to the issue of `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension` not detecting dimensionless exponents correctly.

1. **sympy/physics/units/quantities.py:Quantity._collect_factor_and_dimension**:  
   This function provides a deprecation warning and refers the calling to `UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension`. Since it advises to use the `UnitSystem` version instead, the implementation of the `Quantity` version is not directly relevant to the core issue.

2. **sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py:UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension**:  
   This function is crucial because it contains the logic for extracting scale factors and dimensions from expressions within a unit system. The symptoms outlined in the bug report align with the logic and checks implemented here, especially in handling `Pow` (power) expressions and dimensionless checks, which are often a source of dimension-related issues.

The primary issue focuses on how dimensions are computed in the SI unit system. As a result, the relevant function for examining and possibly patching is from the `UnitSystem` class.

Here's the document listing which contents are needed:

```
sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py:UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension

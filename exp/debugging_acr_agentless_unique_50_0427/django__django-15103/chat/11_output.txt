### Analysis of Current Observed Code

The section of code observed in `load_from_library` primarily provides the mechanism for parsing tokens related to template conditions, namely `ifchanged`. The intention here is to evaluate changes within iterations and execute subsequent nodes based on those changes. 

However, the pertinent abnormality in runtime information indicates a failure to locate the `json_script` template tag, resulting in a `TemplateSyntaxError`. Moreover, the recurrent `AssertionError` regarding file existence check (`assert os.path.exists(file_path)`) is noted, stemming from the debugging tool setup (`pysnooper_axel/dbgsnooper`). This assertion error reflects an issue with the testing environment but doesn't directly affect Django's template processing functionality.

### Abnormal Program Behavior

The main issue in the abnormal behavior is stemming from the absence of `json_script`. There is no evidence that `json_script` is defined or registered as a filter or tag in Django's template system. Additionally, the `assert` error points to a configuration mishap during debugging setup but is non-critical to Django's inherent functionality.

### Identification of Root Cause

The critical reason for the faulty behavior is the missing or misplaced registration of `json_script` within Django, preventing its proper loading and application. Observations show the current snippets mainly handling parsing logic instead of tag registration or library loading, suggesting moving scrutiny towards areas dealing with tag/filters registry in Django's setup.

Given this analysis, a further investigation into template tag registration processes and library setups in Django is necessary to pinpoint why `json_script` isn't accessible.

### Next Steps

To identify the root cause of the template tag issue, the next logical step is to observe the parts where Django registers or initializes template tags and filters. This exploration should shed light on whether `json_script` exists and how it should be incorporated into Django's template system.

To resolve the issue, I need to investigate the `units.quantity_input` decorator implementation. This requires examining the relevant sections of the `quantity_input` decorator to understand how it handles function signatures and return values.

Since the `quantity_input` decorator likely sits within a specific module related to `units` in the Astropy codebase, I will need to find where it is defined and analyze the code for the decorator.

I'll start by searching for the `quantity_input` method in the Astropy codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("quantity_input")
```

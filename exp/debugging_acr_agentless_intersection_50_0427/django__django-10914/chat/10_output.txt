### Patch Review

**Patch Context:**
The patch aims to modify the `_save` method in `django/core/files/storage.py` to explicitly set file permissions to `0o644` when `file_permissions_mode` is not defined. The intended behavior is to ensure consistent permissions across uploaded files, addressing the current inconsistency between `InMemoryUploadedFile` and `TemporaryUploadedFile`.

**Problem with Patch:**
The `PATCHED OUTPUT` indicates an `IndentationError`, suggesting that the patch introduces a syntax error. The indentation is incorrect in the replacement code, thereby causing the error.

### Test Output Analysis

**Original Output:**
The test fails because file permissions are initially set to `0o600`, as indicated by the assertion error.

**Patched Output:**
The test results in an `IndentationError` due to improper application of the patch, preventing the test from executing correctly.

### Conclusion

The issue remains unresolved because the patch failed to apply correctly, introducing a syntax error (`IndentationError`) that halted execution. The intended fix to ensure consistent `0o644` permissions was not actually tested due to the error.

Issue resolved: `False`

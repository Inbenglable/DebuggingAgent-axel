I need to retrieve the source code for the `EncodedFile.__getattr__` method in the `src/_pytest/capture.py` file to understand how attributes are being relayed and mode is potentially misrepresented. This will allow me to pinpoint if and where an adjustment can be made to correct the mode representation.

```python
search_method_in_file("src/_pytest/capture.py", "EncodedFile.__getattr__")
```

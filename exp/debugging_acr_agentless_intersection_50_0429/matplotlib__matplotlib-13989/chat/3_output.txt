The issue arises when using the `plt.hist()` function with the `density=True` option and a specified `range=(0, 1)`. The expected behavior is that the bin edges should start at 0 and end at 1. However, this is not happening in the current implementation. 

From the previously analyzed code snippet, the problem seems to be related to the way bins are calculated when `density` is set to `True`. The incorrect bin calculation is reflected in the assertion failure in the test case.

The observed method extracted from the function in `matplotlib/axes/_axes.py` gave some context around the handling of bins, but we haven't yet seen the complete computation of these bins and how `density` influences this process.

To locate the buggy code precisely, I will continue tracing into the actual computation of the histogram bins within the `Axes.hist` method and see how `density=True` affects this. This will help identify where the behavior diverges from the expected outcome.

Hence, I will proceed by observing further into the histogram calculation logic within the `Axes.hist` function.

Observed method: `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py:Axes.hist`

You are a debugging agent tasked with precisely using tools to resolve issues and submit pull requests.

**Current Task:**  
Resolve the following issue in the django project:

add ModelAdmin.get_inlines() hook to allow set inlines based on the request or model instance.
Description
	
add ModelAdmin.get_inlines() hook to allow set inlines based on the request or model instance.
Currently, We can override the method get_inline_instances to do such a thing, but a for loop should be copied to my code. So I wished add a hook get_inlines(request, obj=None)


Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:



**Test Execution Results:**



Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

1. Create a minimal debugging test based on the reproduce test.
2. Debug by reviewing the relevant source code and monitoring runtime information.
3. Once you have identified the root cause, modify the code with minimal changes.
4. Rerun the reproduction script to confirm that the issue is fixed.

Focus on Step 1: generate a debugging test. At the end of your analysis, provide the specific code in the following **JSON format**.
Note: You should clearly specify the tests you are debugging as much as possible. Minimizing the amount of code will better assist you in analyzing runtime information later.


{
"debugging_test" : "import ... # Your debugging test code here"
}

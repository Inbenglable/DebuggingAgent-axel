To resolve this issue, I need to inspect the behavior of the `Dagger` operator and its interaction with the `IdentityOperator`. It seems that I need to modify how the `Dagger` interacts with the `IdentityOperator` to ensure proper simplification.

I'll start by looking at the `Dagger` and `IdentityOperator` classes as well as their multiplication logic. This might involve checking the `__mul__` method or similar operator overloads. 

Let's search for those components in the codebase:

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Dagger")
search_class_in_codebase("IdentityOperator")
```

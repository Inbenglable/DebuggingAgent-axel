The root of the issue appears to be in the behavior of the `use_required_attribute()` method within the `FileInput` and `ClearableFileInput`. The essential task is to ensure `FileInput` can check the presence of initial data and decide if the 'required' attribute should be used or not, similar to `ClearableFileInput`.

Currently, the error message "setup_test_environment() was already called and can't be called again without first calling teardown_test_environment()" is unrelated to the form widget logic. This error is occurring due to the way the test environment setup is being managed in the test script, which isn't directly connected to the underlying form widget behavior that relates to the 'required' attribute.

The main area of focus needs to be on enabling `FileInput` to utilize or implement the similar check for initial data when determining the 'required' attribute as implemented in `ClearableFileInput`.

Given the scope already analyzed, it's clear that the issue relies on extending or adapting the `FileInput` class behavior. To address the `setup_test_environment()` issue separately would involve changes to the script structure to prevent redundant calls without ensuring proper teardown; however, this doesn't relate to the form widget issue directly tied to the bug report.

For resolving the primary form widget issue, the focus should remain on aligning `FileInput` behavior regarding `use_required_attribute()`.

I will proceed to further observe the method defining `use_required_attribute()` to finalize on implementing similar functionality in the `FileInput`.

Observed scope: `django/forms/widgets.py:454-470`

#### ISSUE
partitions() reusing the output dictionaries
The partitions() iterator in sympy.utilities.iterables reuses the output dictionaries. There is a caveat about it in the docstring. 

I'm wondering if it's really that important for it to do this. It shouldn't be that much of a performance loss to copy the dictionary before yielding it. This behavior is very confusing. It means that something as simple as list(partitions()) will give an apparently wrong result. And it can lead to much more subtle bugs if the partitions are used in a nontrivial way. 

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

```python
def partitions(n, m=None, k=None, size=False):
    """Generate all partitions of positive integer, n.

    Parameters
    ==========

    m : integer (default gives partitions of all sizes)
        limits number of parts in partition (mnemonic: m, maximum parts)
    k : integer (default gives partitions number from 1 through n)
        limits the numbers that are kept in the partition (mnemonic: k, keys)
    size : bool (default False, only partition is returned)
        when ``True`` then (M, P) is returned where M is the sum of the
        multiplicities and P is the generated partition.

    Each partition is represented as a dictionary, mapping an integer
    to the number of copies of that integer in the partition.  For example,
    the first partition of 4 returned is {4: 1}, "4: one of them".

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.utilities.iterables import partitions

    The numbers appearing in the partition (the key of the returned dict)
    are limited with k:

    >>> for p in partitions(6, k=2):  # doctest: +SKIP
    ...     print(p)
    {2: 3}
    {1: 2, 2: 2}
    {1: 4, 2: 1}
    {1: 6}

    The maximum number of parts in the partition (the sum of the values in
    the returned dict) are limited with m (default value, None, gives
    partitions from 1 through n):

    >>> for p in partitions(6, m=2):  # doctest: +SKIP
    ...     print(p)
    ...
    {6: 1}
    {1: 1, 5: 1}
    {2: 1, 4: 1}
    {3: 2}

    Note that the _same_ dictionary object is returned each time.
    This is for speed:  generating each partition goes quickly,
    taking constant time, independent of n.

    >>> [p for p in partitions(6, k=2)]
    [{1: 6}, {1: 6}, {1: 6}, {1: 6}]

    If you want to build a list of the returned dictionaries then
    make a copy of them:

    >>> [p.copy() for p in partitions(6, k=2)]  # doctest: +SKIP
    [{2: 3}, {1: 2, 2: 2}, {1: 4, 2: 1}, {1: 6}]
    >>> [(M, p.copy()) for M, p in partitions(6, k=2, size=True)]  # doctest: +SKIP
    [(3, {2: 3}), (4, {1: 2, 2: 2}), (5, {1: 4, 2: 1}), (6, {1: 6})]

Your Output:
Ready generation: True
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

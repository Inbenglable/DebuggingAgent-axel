To resolve the issue, I need to review how the argument parsing and handling of mutually exclusive groups is managed in the `call_command` function. In specific, the handling of mutually exclusive groups should be updated to correctly recognize and process the group as required if any of its arguments are provided via `**options`.

Currently, based on the retrieved source code of the `call_command` function, I have a clear understanding of how arguments are parsed. Therefore, I should generate the patch directly without needing to search for additional codes.

Ready generation: `True`

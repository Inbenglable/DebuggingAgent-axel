Upon reviewing the patch, it intended to resolve the issue by skipping the monotonicity check for coordinates that are identical across all datasets. This approach seems correct based on the problem description because it should prevent the unnecessary ValueError when coordinates are identical but non-monotonic.

However, the patched output indicates a `KeyError: 0`, which suggests that there's an error in accessing elements within `combined_ids`. This error implies that the patch introduced a new bug instead of fixing the existing one.

Given the test output before and after applying the patch:
- **Original Output**: Demonstrates the raised `ValueError` due to non-monotonic coordinates.
- **Patched Output**: Displays a new error, `KeyError: 0`.

The issue does not appear to be resolved, as the patch introduces a new problem rather than addressing the initial bug.

Issue resolved: `False`

To resolve the issue, I need to understand the implementation of the `__eq__` method in the `BooleanAtom` class, where `S.false` is presumably derived from. This will help in appropriately handling comparisons of boolean values with numerical zero representations like `S(0)` or `S(0.0)`.

Based on the information gathered, `BooleanAtom` does not currently have an `__eq__` method explicitly defined in its class, suggesting that it may rely on either a superclass implementation or a default Python implementation. Therefore, it's necessary to examine whether such a method exists in that class or surrounding code.

I'll start by searching for the equality method in the `BooleanAtom` class or the surrounding logic in the `sympy/logic/boolalg.py` file.

```python
search_class_in_file("sympy/logic/boolalg.py", "BooleanAtom")
search_method_in_file("sympy/logic/boolalg.py", "__eq__")
```

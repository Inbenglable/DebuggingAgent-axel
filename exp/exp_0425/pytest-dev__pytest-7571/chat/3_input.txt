You need to trace the abnormal program to resolve project issues and submit pull requests.
Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **pytest** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
caplog fixture doesn't restore log level after test
From the documentation at https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.0.0/logging.html#caplog-fixture, "The log levels set are restored automatically at the end of the test".
It used to work, but looks broken in new 6.0 release. Minimal example to reproduce:

```
def test_foo(caplog):
    caplog.set_level(42)

def test_bar(caplog):
    print(caplog.handler.level)
```

It prints "0" for pytest<6, "42" after.

</ISSUE>


Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
import pytest

def test_foo(caplog):
    print(f"Initial handler level: {caplog.handler.level}")
    caplog.set_level(42)
    print(f"Handler level after set_level: {caplog.handler.level}")

def test_bar(caplog):
    print(f"Handler level in next test: {caplog.handler.level}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pytest.main([__file__, "-v"])


This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
Given the issue description and the provided test script, the problem appears to stem from the `caplog` fixture not restoring the log level after a test when it should. The test script behavior shows that the log level set in `test_foo` (42) is still present in `test_bar`, indicating the log level was not reset to its original state after `test_foo` was completed.

To address this defect, we need to analyze the behavior of the `caplog` fixture, particularly focusing on how it handles log level modifications and restoration at the end of each test function.

The test appears to indicate that the handling or wrap up after test execution is where the issue lies, which would most likely involve the context or cleanup around tests in the logging handler.

To trace further, we need to observe the method in the pytest codebase responsible for setting and restoring the log level, especially focusing on handler operations with `caplog`. Proceeding, I will observe potential methods involving hook functions or fixture tear-down mechanisms relevant to `caplog`.

Observed method: `src/_pytest/logging.py:LogCaptureFixture.set_level`
==================================================
The initial analysis of the `LogCaptureFixture.set_level` method shows that it sets the log level on line 436 with `logger_obj.setLevel(level)` and presumably restores the original log level later using the `self._initial_logger_levels` dictionary which stores the initial log level on line 435. However, the issue is that these levels aren't restored automatically at the end of the test, as indicated by the user's complaint.

The problem likely lies in how and when these stored initial levels are supposed to be used to reset the log level at the end of a test, which is usually handled in a tear-down or finalization method within the fixture lifecycle.

To identify the root cause, I need to observe the finalization logic of the `LogCaptureFixture` to ensure the log levels stored in `self._initial_logger_levels` are indeed restored. This involves tracing the teardown processes or any cleanup mechanisms related to the fixture, which are typically located in methods like `_finalize`.

To further investigate, I will observe the `_finalize` method, since this is logically connected with restoring states or performing cleanup. 

Observed scope: `src/_pytest/logging.py:120-160`

Now you choose LogCaptureFixture.set_level's code snippet 
   120	        Default behavior is auto-indent off.
   121	
   122	        Using the string "True" or "on" or the boolean True as the value
   123	        turns auto indent on, using the string "False" or "off" or the
   124	        boolean False or the int 0 turns it off, and specifying a
   125	        positive integer fixes the indentation position to the value
   126	        specified.

You need to trace the abnormal program behavior step by step to identify the root cause of the bug and locate the buggy method that contains the code to be fixed.
Now, please first analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior. 

Then, if you can already locate the buggy method and buggy code, reply with:  
Buggy method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Otherwise, continue tracing by selecting the next method to observe. Reply with: 
Observed method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Note that {FILE_PATH} refers to the path relative to the repository. And if you want to observe a method inside a class, please specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME.

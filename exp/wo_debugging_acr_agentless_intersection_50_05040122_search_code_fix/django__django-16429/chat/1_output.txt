To resolve the issue, I need to examine the source code within the `django/utils/timesince.py` file, specifically around the instantiation of the `pivot` datetime object. This will help me understand how the `tzinfo` is handled and how to fix the TypeError by incorporating timezone information.

I will search for the relevant code in the `django/utils/timesince.py` file. Since the issue points to a specific line, I will search around those lines to understand the context of where the pivot is instantiated.

```python
search_code_in_file("django/utils/timesince.py", "datetime.datetime(pivot_year, pivot_month, pivot_day)")
```

Based on the error message and description provided in the issue, the error is associated with the check `p.new in sentinels` returning a boolean array when `p.new` is a numpy array. To fix this, a patch should be made to handle arrays explicitly or convert the arrays to scalar values using `any()` or `all()` methods.

The implicated code is in `/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/_pytest/compat.py`. Specifically, the issue emerges from `num_mock_patch_args()` when dealing with numpy arrays.

To generate the patch, I need to retrieve the source code for the following components:
1. The `num_mock_patch_args` method in the `_pytest/compat.py` file.

I'll go ahead and retrieve the source code for this method. 

```python
search_method_in_file("_pytest/compat.py", "num_mock_patch_args")
```

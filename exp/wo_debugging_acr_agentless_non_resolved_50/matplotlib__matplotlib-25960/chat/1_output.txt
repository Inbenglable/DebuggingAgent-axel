To resolve the issue, I need to understand the implementation of `Figure.subfigures` and how it handles `wspace` and `hspace`. This involves retrieving the source code of the `subfigures` method in the `Figure` class within the `figure.py` file. Additionally, I need to check where `wspace` and `hspace` are being utilized or should be applied in the implementation.

Let's begin by retrieving the source code of the `Figure.subfigures` method.

```python
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/figure.py", "Figure.subfigures")
```

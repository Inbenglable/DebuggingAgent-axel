Let's review the patch and analyze the test outputs before and after applying it.

### Patch Review
The patch modifies the condition in the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass to check for both functions and properties by introducing a check for `inspect.isdatadescriptor(val)`. This change should resolve the issue by allowing the metaclass to inherit docstrings for properties in addition to methods.

### Test Output Analysis
- **Original Output:** 
  The test fails at the assertion `assert Derived.prop.__doc__ == "This is the property docstring."`, indicating that the docstring for the property `prop` was not inherited before the patch was applied.

- **Patched Output:** 
  There is no output or traceback, which suggests that the test passed successfully after applying the patch. This implies that both assertions, including the one for the property docstring, were satisfied.

Considering both the implemented patch and the passing test result after the patch, it indicates that the issue of docstrings not being inherited for properties has been resolved.

Issue resolved: `True`

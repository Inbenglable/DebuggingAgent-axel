To address the issue, I need to examine the implementation of the `Permutation` class, specifically the constructor or any factory methods that handle the conversion or processing of cycles into permutations. The issue lies in handling non-disjoint cycles, which means I need to understand how cycles are currently processed.

I'll start by retrieving the code for the `Permutation` class. If needed, I'll focus on its constructor and any relevant methods that deal with processing cycles.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Permutation")
```

To determine whether the issue is fixed, let's evaluate the patch and the output results:

### Patch Evaluation
- The patch focuses on modifying the `hist()` method in the `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py` file.
- The change involves adding the `range=bin_range` argument to the `hist_kwargs` dictionary in the part of the code where options for creating the histogram are being prepared when `density=True`.
- This explicitly ensures that the range specified by the user in `plt.hist()` is respected by the histogram computation even when density normalization is applied.

### Test Output Analysis
- **Original Output**: The bins produced by the test before the patch were `[0.14663883, 0.28644815, 0.42625746, 0.56606678, 0.70587609, 0.84568541]`, which do not start at 0 and end at 1, violating the expected outcome.
- **Patched Output**: After applying the patch, the bins output was `[0.  0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1. ]`, which correctly starts at 0 and ends at 1, matching the expected outcome described.

Considering the changes made by the patch and the successful test output following its application, the issue with `hist()` not respecting the range parameter when `density=True` appears to be resolved.

Issue resolved: `True`

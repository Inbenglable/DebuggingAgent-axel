To resolve the issue, I need to inspect the source code of the `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` classes, as well as the `get_current_timezone_name` method mentioned in the description. Specifically, I need to analyze the part where it discards the tzinfo object and uses the default timezone. Provided the description references lines from the file `django/db/models/functions/datetime.py`, I will use the following API calls to retrieve the necessary code:

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncBase")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncDate")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncTime")
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "get_current_timezone_name")
```

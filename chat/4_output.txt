### Observation of Runtime Information

From the runtime information:
- The output of `separability_matrix` shows the unexpected results as previously described: the nested compound model is not computing separability correctly.
- The `_operators` function in `_separable` uses `_cstack` which returns matrices which are not consistent with the expected separability logic for nested models.

### Source Code Analysis and Runtime Information

#### Notable Points:
- **Flow in `_separable`:** Visiting lines between 307-309, confirms the issue may lie in how `_operators` manages compound model logic. Specifically, `_operators[transform.op](sepleft, sepright)` uses operations like `_cstack`, which are possibly incorrect for nested behavior.
- **Logic in `CompoundModel`:** The effective separation matrix computations need a finer breakdown or handling for nested operations not reflectively provided by `CompoundModel`.

### Moving to Resolution

After reviewing the runtime and relevant code sections:
- The logic discrepancy when nested compound models affect separability computation is evident.
- Adjustments required within `CompoundModel` logic to correct nesting functionality.
- Source modification shall maintain separation computation consistency, especially in `_separable`.

### JSON Output for Step Transition

```json
{
    "move_to_step_3": "True",
    "review_src": null,
    "runtime_info": null
}
```

### Explanation:

- **move_to_step_3**: Progress to Step 3, ready to adjust the conception in `CompoundModel` to ensure proper separability in nested conditions.
- **review_src** and **runtime_info**: Set to null as the prerequisite analysis is completed, focusing on precise changes now.

The decision and details planned out here highlight the pivotal errors and enable us to transition into solving the underlying code issues effectively.

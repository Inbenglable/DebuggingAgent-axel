From the analysis of the issue and the runtime information provided for the `_BarPlotter` class in `seaborn/categorical.py`, the problem seems to revolve around how the nominal scales are managed when generating categorical plots using Seaborn. Specifically:

1. **Tick Mark Positioning**: The test indicates a failure due to the nominal scale not drawing tick marks to `-0.5` from the first tick and `len(data['category']) - 0.5` from the last tick. This implies that the adjustment of tick locations (expansion to `-0.5` and `+0.5` margins) isn't being applied.

2. **Initialization in `_BarPlotter`**: The `_BarPlotter.__init__` method sets up the plot without specific accommodation for nominal scale adjustments in tick positioning which could be causing this issue.

3. **Categorical Axis Adjustments**: The `_finalize_figure` needs to explicitly handle the limits for the axes when the nominal scale is used. This might not be occurring correctly or at all in the current implementation.

Given this understanding, it's likely that the adjustments for nominal scales need to be applied somewhere dealing with axis limits or during the drawing process within these plotting helper methods.

To proceed, I will focus on exploring how the plotter finalizes the figure in terms of axis limits specifically for nominal scales. This involves delving into the `_finalize_figure` method of the `Plotter` class that may include or interact with any scale settings or configurations.

Observed scope: `seaborn/_core/plot.py:_finalize_figure` 

Please provide information on the `_finalize_figure` process or the relevant section in the plot code handling axis setups for categorical plotting.

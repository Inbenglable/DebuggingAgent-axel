In order to address the issue, I've analyzed the current information gathered from the code. The `_delete_composed_index` method is crucial in understanding how constraints are identified and managed. The core issue seems to stem from a conflict between `index_together` and `unique_together` constraints during migrations. 

From what I have retrieved so far, I have not yet gathered the full details of some components that may directly affect the issueâ€”specifically, how Django handles `unique_together` in migrations.

Let me review the class or methods that deal specifically with `unique_together` and its management during migrations to see how they might interact with `index_together`.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("_constraint_names")
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor._constraint_names")
```
This should provide insights into why multiple constraints are found and help identify the necessary adjustments to resolve the issue.

To address the issue with the `add_fields` method in the `BaseFormSet` class, we need to adjust the conditional statement that results in a `TypeError` when the `index` is `None`. Hereâ€™s the patch in the required *SEARCH/REPLACE* format:

```pythony
### django/forms/formsets.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or index < initial_form_count):
=======
        if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or (index is not None and index < initial_form_count)):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, I'll encapsulate this in the JSON format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/forms/formsets.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or index < initial_form_count):\n=======\n        if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or (index is not None and index < initial_form_count)):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

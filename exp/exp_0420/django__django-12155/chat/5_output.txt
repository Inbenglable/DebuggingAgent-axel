To resolve the reported issue in the `trim_docstring` function, I'll create a patch following the specified *SEARCH/REPLACE* format. Below is the patch that modifies `trim_docstring` to skip the first line when calculating the common leading indentation.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())\n=======\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch ensures the first line is skipped when calculating the indentation, preventing it from affecting the overall indentation calculation and preserving the function's intended behavior in `django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py`.

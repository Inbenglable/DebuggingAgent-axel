To address the issue in the `combine_by_coords` function, we will modify the logic that checks monotonicity of coordinate dimensions. Specifically, we'll introduce a condition to skip the monotonicity check for coordinate dimensions that do not vary between the datasets, as they should be considered identical.

Here's the plan:
- Before the monotonicity check, we'll determine if a coordinate dimension is identical across all datasets.
- If a coordinate dimension is identical, we'll bypass the monotonicity check for that dimension.

Let's create the necessary patch:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### xarray/core/combine.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        # Check the overall coordinates are monotonically increasing\n        for dim in concatenated.dims:\n            if dim in concatenated:\n                indexes = concatenated.indexes.get(dim)\n                if not (indexes.is_monotonic_increasing\n                        or indexes.is_monotonic_decreasing):\n                    raise ValueError(\"Resulting object does not have monotonic\"\n                                     \" global indexes along dimension {}\"\n                                     .format(dim))\n=======\n        # Check the overall coordinates are monotonically increasing, \n        # but skip the check for coordinate dimensions that are identical across all datasets\n        for dim in concatenated.dims:\n            if dim in concatenated:\n                indexes = concatenated.indexes.get(dim)\n                # Determine if the dimension is identical across datasets\n                identical_across_datasets = all(np.array_equal(ds[dim].values, datasets[0][dim].values) for ds in datasets)\n                if not identical_across_datasets and not (indexes.is_monotonic_increasing\n                        or indexes.is_monotonic_decreasing):\n                    raise ValueError(\"Resulting object does not have monotonic\"\n                                     \" global indexes along dimension {}\"\n                                     .format(dim))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch introduces a check to see if a dimension is identical across all datasets. If so, the monotonicity check is skipped for that dimension. This resolves the issue as described, while ensuring that functionality isn't disrupted for non-identical dimensions.

### Analysis of Current Observed Code and Abnormal Program Behavior

From the trace, we are examining the `filter_members` method from `sphinx.ext.autodoc.ModuleDocumenter`. This method is responsible for filtering module members based on various criteria, including whether they are private, undocumented, explicitly excluded, etc. The key steps in this process can be outlined as follows:

1. **Extraction of Member Name and Object:** The method extracts member information and initializes some decision variables (`isattr`, `has_doc`, `isprivate`, `keep`).

2. **Documentation Retrieval:** It retrieves the docstring of each member using the `getdoc` function to determine if a member is documented.

3. **Private and Special Members Filtering:** The method filters members based on their names (e.g., those starting with `_` are considered private) and also based on special member patterns.

4. **Handling of `__all__` attribute (Implicitly):** The `filter_members` method does not explicitly handle the `__all__` attribute. Instead, its logic around `ObjectMember.skipped` suggests that `__all__` is expected to have an effect on which members are considered for documentation.

5. **Skipping Decision:** The final decision to include a member in the documentation is made through various conditions and an event (`autodoc-skip-member`) that can allow user modifications.

### Observed Abnormal Behavior

Currently, despite `__all__` being empty, all functions in the module are being documented, which violates the expected behavior where nothing should be documented if `__all__` is empty.

Given that `filter_members` handles the logic for excluding certain members, it is suspicious that the condition related to handling the `__all__` attribute might be overlooking the `skipped` flag or conditions related to the `__all__`.

### Conclusion

There might be missing or incorrect logic in the way members are marked as skipped when an empty `__all__` attribute should mean no members are included.

### Next Step

Let's trace the code run deeper within the `filter_members` method focusing on the manipulation around the `ObjectMember.skipped` attribute and `want_all` flag that might reveal issues with handling the empty `__all__`.

**Observed scope:** `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:780-810`

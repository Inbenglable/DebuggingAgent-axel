The described issue occurs when the `collectstatic` command is executed in a Django project where `max_post_process_passes` is set to 0 in a custom subclass of `ManifestStaticFilesStorage`. The error specifically originates from an `UnboundLocalError` that occurs in the `post_process` method of `ManifestStaticFilesStorage`.

According to the traceback and issue description, the culprit likely lies in a segment of the code that erroneously assumes that the `substitutions` variable is always initialized, which is not the case when no iterations occur due to `max_post_process_passes = 0`.

The immediate next step would be to further inspect the main location suspected of causing the issue within the following segment of the `django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py` file.

This part of the code involves a decision structure where `substitutions` is expected to be defined.

Considering you suspected the issue is around `substitutions`, let's dive deeper into the method in question:

Observed scope: `django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py:246-257` 

We need to carefully examine this segment to identify where `substitutions` is assumed to be initialized and perhaps devise a conditional assignment or null check. This will help rectify the error and allow setting `max_post_process_passes = 0` without triggering an `UnboundLocalError`.

To understand the abnormal behavior and locate the source of the bug, let's focus on how `split_surds` and its downstream function `_split_gcd` are being invoked. The observed trace indicates that the `IndexError` emerges from an assumption of non-empty input to `_split_gcd`.

The observed snippet in `radsimp.py` shows a fragment of the code right after `split_surds`, but it does not provide insight into why `a` could be empty. To identify the root cause, it is crucial to explore how `split_surds` passes arguments to `_split_gcd`. 

Given that the error arises when attempting to access `a[0]` in `_split_gcd`, the problem is likely in how the surds are processed or filtered in `split_surds`. Therefore, for the next step, observing `split_surds` itself seems essential to diagnosing why there's an empty tuple being passed to `_split_gcd`.

Observed method: `sympy/simplify/radsimp.py:split_surds`

The observed issue suggests modifying the logic in the `submit_row` method within the template tags of the Django admin module to add an additional check for the 'has_add_permission'. 

Given the issue report and the test provided, it appears the test script encountered an error due to incorrect command-line arguments. This issue is outside the context of the code that needs to be modified to resolve the permission check.

Let's inspect the code of the `submit_row` method to ensure we understand where the modification needs to be added.

Observed method: `django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py:submit_row`

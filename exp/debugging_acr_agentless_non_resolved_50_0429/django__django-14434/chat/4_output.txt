To resolve the issue, I need to understand how the `BaseDatabaseWrapper` is initialized, and specifically, what the format or structure of `settings_dict` is required for the initialization. I'm interested in examining the constructor of `BaseDatabaseWrapper` because it will provide insights into how `settings_dict` should be constructed or passed. 

Thus, I need to retrieve the source code for `BaseDatabaseWrapper.__init__` to proceed.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("BaseDatabaseWrapper.__init__")
```

To resolve the reported issue, we need to modify the `trim_docstring` function so that it skips the first line when determining the indentation. I need to first locate and retrieve the source code for the `trim_docstring` method in the Django project to confirm its current implementation. Since the file path is not provided, I will search for the method in the whole project codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("trim_docstring")
```

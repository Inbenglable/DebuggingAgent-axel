## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Migration crashes deleting an index_together if there is a unique_together on the same fields
Description
	
Happens with Django 1.11.10
Steps to reproduce:
1) Create models with 2 fields, add 2 same fields to unique_together and to index_together
2) Delete index_together -> Fail
It will fail at django/db/backends/base/schema.py, line 378, in _delete_composed_index(), ValueError: Found wrong number (2) of constraints for as this one will find two constraints, the _uniq and the _idx one. No way to get out of this...
The worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the "new" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.
I think there are 2 different points here:
1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together
2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To address the issue, I need to inspect the source code of the `_delete_composed_index` method where the error occurs. This will help me understand the code further so I can generate an appropriate patch.

I'll start by searching for this method in the `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "_delete_composed_index")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "_delete_composed_index")
RESULT:
#### django/db/backends/base/schema.py:BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor._delete_composed_index
```python
    def _delete_composed_index(self, model, fields, constraint_kwargs, sql):
        meta_constraint_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.constraints}
        meta_index_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.indexes}
        columns = [model._meta.get_field(field).column for field in fields]
        constraint_names = self._constraint_names(
            model, columns, exclude=meta_constraint_names | meta_index_names,
            **constraint_kwargs
        )
        if len(constraint_names) != 1:
            raise ValueError("Found wrong number (%s) of constraints for %s(%s)" % (
                len(constraint_names),
                model._meta.db_table,
                ", ".join(columns),
            ))
        self.execute(self._delete_constraint_sql(sql, model, constraint_names[0]))

```


==================================================

Your Output:
To generate the patch, it would be beneficial to understand how the `_constraint_names` method operates, as it is essential in generating the list of constraints for the given fields. I need to review the source code for this method to understand any possible changes or how it interacts with the constraints in case of `index_together` and `unique_together`.

search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "_constraint_names")

                    result.append(name)
        return result

```

Your Output:
Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

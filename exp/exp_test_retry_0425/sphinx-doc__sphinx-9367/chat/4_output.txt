Based on the information provided, the main issue arises from the attempt to import a function, `ast2commentedcode`, from the `sphinx.pycode.ast` module, which is resulting in an ImportError. This indicates that the function `ast2commentedcode` does not exist in the specified module.

Given that the problem is with the import statement and the erroneous behavior is encountered immediately after attempting the import, our initial focus should be on investigating the `sphinx.pycode.ast` module. We need to verify whether `ast2commentedcode` is defined or if perhaps its name is incorrect or has been moved elsewhere.

Let's proceed to analyze the `sphinx.pycode.ast` module to find relevant functions dealing with AST transformations that might relate to what `ast2commentedcode` is expected to do.

Observed method: `sphinx/pycode/ast.py`

To address the issue, we need to alter the `ConciseDateFormatter` in such a way that it ensures the year is displayed in the offset string even if January is not part of the plotted range. The related source code has been partially explored, but we need the `get_offset` method, which retrieves the offset and may need adjustments.

Looking at the `get_offset` method, we see it returns `self.offset_string`. This suggests that `self.offset_string` needs to be properly set to include the year, even when January is not on the x-axis. To evaluate if the logic for setting this string properly accounts for situations where the range is less than a year and doesn't include January, we should look for any logic that modifies `self.offset_string`.

It seems that the code gathered is enough to implement a fix or patch. No need to delve deeper into other parts of the `ConciseDateFormatter` at the moment since the primary focus is ensuring the year is part of the offset.

Therefore, since we have sufficient information for the current context to attempt a solution by changing the offset logic, let's proceed to generate the patch.

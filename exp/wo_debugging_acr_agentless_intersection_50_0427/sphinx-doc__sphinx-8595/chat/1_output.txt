To resolve the issue, I need to inspect the implementation of the autodoc extension within the Sphinx project to understand how it currently handles the `__all__` attribute and where the logic for determining which members to document is located. It's likely located within a core part of the autodoc functionality.

I should begin by examining relevant classes or methods responsible for processing modules and handling the `:members:` option in the autodoc extension.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("sphinx.ext.autodoc.Documenter")
search_method_in_codebase("process_docstring")
search_method_in_codebase("add_documenter")
```

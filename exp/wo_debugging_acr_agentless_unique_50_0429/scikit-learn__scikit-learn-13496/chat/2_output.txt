To generate the patch for the issue, I need to add the `warm_start` parameter to the `IsolationForest.__init__()` method and ensure the `fit` method is capable of handling `warm_start` correctly. The `fit` method should include logic to add more estimators to the ensemble when `warm_start` is set to `True`. I'll also need to retrieve the source code for the `fit` method to ensure proper handling of `warm_start`.

Here's how I'll proceed:

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py", "IsolationForest.fit")
```

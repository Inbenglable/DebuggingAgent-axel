To address the identified problem with the `partitions` function in `sympy.utilities.iterables`, I need to retrieve the source code of the `partitions` method first. This will allow me to examine the current implementation and determine where a deep copy or other modification might be inserted to ensure that unique dictionary instances are yielded each time.

I'll search for the `partitions` method in the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/utilities/iterables.py", "partitions")
```

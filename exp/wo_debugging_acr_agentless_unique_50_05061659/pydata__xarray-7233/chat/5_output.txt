To address the issue of non-dimensional coordinates being demoted to variables during the `construct` operation in the `DatasetCoarsen` class, I've already retrieved the necessary parts of the code. I have the implementations for the `coarsen` method, the `DatasetCoarsen` class, and the `DatasetCoarsen.construct` method.

I am ready to generate the patch to keep non-dimensional coordinates as coordinates after the `construct` operation.

Ready generation: `True`

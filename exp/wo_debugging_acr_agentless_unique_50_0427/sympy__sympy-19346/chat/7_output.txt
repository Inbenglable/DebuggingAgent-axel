To address the issue with `srepr` not properly printing `dict` and `set` objects, we need to implement specific `_print_dict` and `_print_set` methods in the `ReprPrinter` class. These methods will handle dictionaries and sets by returning a string representation where their contents are appropriately processed by the printer.

I'll make the necessary modifications using the SEARCH/REPLACE format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/printing/repr.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    def _print_tuple(self, expr):\n=======\n    def _print_dict(self, expr):\n        items = [f'{self.doprint(k)}: {self.doprint(v)}' for k, v in expr.items()]\n        return '{' + ', '.join(items) + '}'\n\n    def _print_set(self, expr):\n        items = [self.doprint(item) for item in sorted(expr, key=str)]\n        return '{' + ', '.join(items) + '}'\n\n    def _print_tuple(self, expr):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation

- **_print_dict**: This method iterates over the dictionary's items, applying `doprint` to both keys and values. The items are formatted as strings `key: value` and joined with commas, then enclosed in curly braces.

- **_print_set**: This method processes each item in the set by converting the set to a list sorted by string representation to ensure consistent order, applying `doprint` to each item, and joining them with commas before enclosing them in curly braces.

You need to trace the abnormal program to resolve project issues and submit pull requests.
Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **requests** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Removing a default header of a session
[The docs](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#session-objects) say that you can prevent sending a session header by setting the headers value to None in the method's arguments. You would expect (as [discussed on IRC](https://botbot.me/freenode/python-requests/msg/10788170/)) that this would work for session's default headers, too:

``` python
session = requests.Session()
# Do not send Accept-Encoding
session.headers['Accept-Encoding'] = None
```

What happens is that "None"  gets sent as the value of header.

```
Accept-Encoding: None
```

For the reference, here is a way that works:

``` python
del session.headers['Accept-Encoding']
```


</ISSUE>


Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
import requests

# Create a session
session = requests.Session()

# Try to remove Accept-Encoding header by setting it to None
session.headers['Accept-Encoding'] = None

# Make a request to see what headers are sent
r = session.get('http://httpbin.org/headers')
print(r.json())


This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
To begin resolving this issue, let's first break down what we know from the description and the trace:

### Problem Summary:
- The issue arises when trying to prevent sending a session header (`Accept-Encoding` in this case) by setting it to `None`.
- The expected behavior, according to the documentation, is that setting a header to `None` should prevent it from being sent.
- Instead, `None` is sent as a string value in the header (`Accept-Encoding: None`).
- A test script reproduces this behavior, and a traceback shows that this leads to a `TypeError: expected string or bytes-like object`.

The traceback is particularly helpful in understanding where this error occurs:
- The error surfaces during the HTTP request preparation/sending process. 
- Specifically, it occurs when `http.client.putheader` method is called within the Python standard library, indicating a non-string header value is being handled improperly.

### Analysis and Hypothesis:
- The method `__setitem__` of `CaseInsensitiveDict` is storing the `None` value directly, without handling the conversion or removal of headers set to `None`.
- During the preparation of the HTTP request, these `None` values are likely treated as objects that cannot be encoded or that contradict expected types.

To narrow down the bug further, we should investigate how the session headers are being processed and converted into the final HTTP request. The critical observation will be checking where header values are formatted for sending.

### Next Step:
We should trace how the headers are processed from the session to the HTTP request. This involves looking at how the session headers are utilized at the point of making a request.

Therefore, the next logical step is to observe the method responsible for preparing the request:
- **File:** `requests/sessions.py`
- **Method:** Responsible for request preparation, probably involves `Session.request` or `Session.prepare_request`.

Let's observe the likely candidate:
```plaintext
Observed method: requests/sessions.py:Session.request
```
==================================================
Based on the problem summary and the analysis step, the error trace suggests that the issue arises from incorrect handling of `None` values within the session headers. 

In the runtime information for `Session.request`, we see that a `TypeError` is raised when attempting to use `http.client.putheader`. This indicates that the header values are being passed improperly when they are assigned `None` in the session headers.

From the `Session.request` method code, the constructed `Request` object is passed to `self.prepare_request(req)`:

```python
357    prep = self.prepare_request(req)
```

The issue likely stems from how these headers are processed during the preparation of the request, which is downstream from `Session.request`.

To further trace this behavior, it's logical to dive into how `prepare_request` processes the headers:

### Next Step:
Let's observe deeper into how the request preparation handles the session headers before the request is sent:

Observed scope: `requests/sessions.py:357-358`

This scope includes the call to `self.prepare_request(req)`, which prepares the headers for the actual HTTP request. Understanding this sequence will help identify how `None` values are handled in headers.
==================================================


Now you choose Session.request's code snippet 
   357	        prep = self.prepare_request(req)
   358	

for further observation, tracing the abnormal program behavior.

This is the runtime information of the code snippet you choose to observed in Session.request:

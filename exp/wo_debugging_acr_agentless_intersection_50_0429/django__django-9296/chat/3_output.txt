To implement the `__iter__` method, we need to retrieve the full source code of the `Paginator` class so that we can appropriately place and integrate the implementation. The `Paginator` class outline did not provide its internal methods' actual code structure. Thus, I'll proceed to retrieve the full source code of the `Paginator` class from its file.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/core/paginator.py", "Paginator")
```

To resolve the issue, I need to examine the source code of the `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension()` method to understand how it handles dimension evaluation for expressions. This will help me identify why it fails to recognize dimensionless exponents.

Since I need to locate and inspect this method, I will start by searching for it in the codebase. 

```python
search_method_in_codebase("SI._collect_factor_and_dimension")
```

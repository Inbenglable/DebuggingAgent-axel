To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code for the `_rename()` method of the `RenameContentType` class located in the `django/contrib/contenttypes/management/__init__.py` file. This will allow me to confirm the necessary changes to the `content_type.save()` method as suggested in the issue description. 

I'll proceed with searching for the `_rename()` method in the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/contenttypes/management/__init__.py", "RenameContentType._rename")
```

To resolve the issue, I need to examine the source code of the `floatformat` template filter function. Given the information provided, we need to ensure that when Decimal numbers are involved, the precision is preserved, and they are not incorrectly converted to floats.

To generate the patch, I must retrieve the source code for the `floatformat` method, which is likely to be found in the part of Django handling template filters. Since I don't have the specific file path, I will search for the method within the codebase.

Let's proceed with retrieving the necessary source code.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("floatformat")
```

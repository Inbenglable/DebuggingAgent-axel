To address the issue related to file upload permissions in Django, the first step is to identify where in the Django codebase the file upload permissions are being set or managed. This would typically involve understanding how `FileSystemStorage` handles file uploads and where it might default to current file permission settings.

The typical place to start looking would be the `FileSystemStorage` class and any references to file permission settings within it. Knowing the structure of Django, this is likely part of the `django.core.files` module.

Therefore, I'll begin by searching for the `FileSystemStorage` class to understand its implementation.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("FileSystemStorage")
```

To resolve the issue where `IndexError: tuple index out of range` is triggered in the `is_fits` function during the `identify_format` call, we need to ensure that `args` is not empty before accessing its first element. The following patch will add a check to ensure `args` has at least one element before trying to access it.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### astropy/io/fits/connect.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    return isinstance(args[0], (HDUList, TableHDU, BinTableHDU, GroupsHDU))\n=======\n    return len(args) > 0 and isinstance(args[0], (HDUList, TableHDU, BinTableHDU, GroupsHDU))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch will check the length of `args` before attempting to access `args[0]`, preventing the `IndexError` when `args` is empty. It maintains the original functionality by performing the `isinstance` check only if `args` is non-empty.

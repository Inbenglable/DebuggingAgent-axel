To fix the issue, I need to verify the implementation of the `_detect_changes` method or the related part where the `KeyError` occurs. Analyzing this will help me determine if the right fix is to change the deletion line to avoid the `KeyError`. Given the traceback, the method causing the KeyError is likely `_detect_changes` within the `MigrationAutodetector` class.

I'll proceed by retrieving the source code for this method in the `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/autodetector.py", "MigrationAutodetector._detect_changes")
```

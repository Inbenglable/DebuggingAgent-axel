To generate a patch for the `LogCaptureFixture._finalize` method, it's important to first obtain its source code in order to understand the current implementation and how to fix the bug related to restoring the log level effectively.

I need to retrieve the source code for the `LogCaptureFixture._finalize` method located in `src/_pytest/logging.py`.

```python
search_method_in_file("src/_pytest/logging.py", "LogCaptureFixture._finalize")
```

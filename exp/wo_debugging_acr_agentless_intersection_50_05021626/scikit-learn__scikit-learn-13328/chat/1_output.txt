To resolve the issue, the `fit` method in the `HuberRegressor` class needs to be retrieved and examined. This will help ensure that appropriate handling of boolean arrays, such as converting them to float, is implemented to avoid the `TypeError`. I will use the relevant APIs to search for the method's source code.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("HuberRegressor")
search_method_in_file("sklearn/linear_model/_huber.py", "HuberRegressor.fit")
```

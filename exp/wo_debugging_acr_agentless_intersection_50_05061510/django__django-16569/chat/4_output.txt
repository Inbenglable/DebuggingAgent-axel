### Review of the Patch

The patch changes the condition in the `add_fields` method from:
```python
if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or index < initial_form_count):
```
to:
```python
if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or (index is not None and index < initial_form_count)):
```

This modification precisely addresses the described issue by checking whether `index` is not `None` before attempting the comparison. This should effectively prevent the `TypeError` that occurs due to the unsupported comparison between `NoneType` and `int`.

### Analysis of the Test Outputs

**Original Output:**
The original output demonstrates that a `TypeError` was raised during execution when calling `my_formset.empty_form`, exactly as the issue described. The stack trace indicates that the exception was due to the comparison between `index` (which is `None`) and `initial_form_count`.

**Patched Output:**
The patched output does not display any exceptions or tracebacks; instead, it shows HTML content representing the form, and the message "The issue is fixed." This suggests that the operation proceeded successfully without encountering the earlier `TypeError`.

### Determination

- The patch directly modifies the faulty condition in the code as per the suggestion provided in the issue description. 
- The test outputs corroborate the patch's effectiveness by showing the absence of the `TypeError` following the modification.
  
Given these observations, it is reasonable to conclude that the patch has resolved the issue.

Issue resolved: `True`

To resolve the issue of instantiating the `NearestNeighbors` class with a float `min_samples`, we need to ensure `min_samples` is converted to an integer when it is a float less than or equal to 1.

Here's the patch to fix the issue:

```python
### sklearn/cluster/optics_.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
if min_samples <= 1:
    min_samples = max(2, min_samples * n_samples)           # Still a float
=======
if min_samples <= 1:
    min_samples = int(round(max(2, min_samples * n_samples))) # Convert to integer
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This patch ensures that when `min_samples` is calculated as a float, it is rounded and converted into an integer before being used by the `NearestNeighbors` class.

Here is the JSON format of the edit:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sklearn/cluster/optics_.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nif min_samples <= 1:\n    min_samples = max(2, min_samples * n_samples)           # Still a float\n=======\nif min_samples <= 1:\n    min_samples = int(round(max(2, min_samples * n_samples))) # Convert to integer\n>>>>>>> REPLACE"
  ]
}
```

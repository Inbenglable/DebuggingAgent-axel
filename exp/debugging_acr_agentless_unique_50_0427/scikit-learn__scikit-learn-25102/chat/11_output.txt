Upon reviewing the patch and analyzing the test output before and after applying the patch, the following observations can be made:

1. **Patch Review**: 
   - The patch attempts to modify the `_wrap_in_pandas_container` function to preserve the original dtypes of the DataFrame by capturing and reapplying them. 
   - The patch includes logic to check if the `data_to_wrap` has a `dtypes` attribute and iterates over the columns of the DataFrame to convert each back to its original dtype if possible.

2. **Test Output Analysis**:
   - **Original Test Output**: Before the patch, there was an `AssertionError` indicating that the dtype for "petal length (cm)" was `float64` instead of the expected `float16`.
   - **Patched Test Output**: After applying the patch, the output remains the same with the `AssertionError` still present. The dtype for "petal length (cm)" is still `float64` rather than `float16`.

The test output after applying the patch indicates that the patch did not successfully resolve the issue as the dtype preservation was not achieved. The original problem persists because the required dtype was not maintained in the output.

Therefore, the issue is not resolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

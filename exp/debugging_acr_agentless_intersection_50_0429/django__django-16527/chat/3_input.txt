## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
"show_save_as_new" in admin can add without this permission
Description
	 
		(last modified by Mariusz Felisiak)
	 
At "django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py" file, line 102, I think you must put one more verification for this tag: "and has_add_permission", because "save_as_new" is a add modification.
I rewrite this for my project:
			"show_save_as_new": not is_popup
			and has_add_permission # This line that I put!!!
			and has_change_permission
			and change
			and save_as,

</ISSUE>


A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
Based on the issue description and the test results, the problem appears to lie in the handling of the `show_save_as_new` context variable within the `submit_row` function. Specifically, the concern is that `show_save_as_new` is being shown even if the user does not have the `has_add_permission`.

The test script is indicating a failure in the first test case, which aligns with the problem described: the "Save as new" option should not be shown if the user does not have add permission.

Given this information, we need to examine the logic that determines the `show_save_as_new` value. From the initial code:

```python
"show_save_as_new": not is_popup
and has_change_permission
and change
and save_as
```

This logic does not currently include a check for `has_add_permission`, which seems to be causing the problem. The fix, as suggested by the issue reporter, would involve adding this check.

Therefore, the method directly related to this issue is the `submit_row` function. We need to analyze its content and logic to make sure it uses the permissions correctly.

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

To determine if the issue is resolved, let's analyze both the patch and the test outputs before and after applying it.

### Patch Analysis
The patch introduces the `use_required_attribute` method into the `FileInput` class. The method is intended to ensure that the 'required' attribute is not included if there is initial data. This is done by overriding the `use_required_attribute` method and returning `False` when initial data is present.

### Test Output Analysis
#### Original Output
The test encountered a runtime error:
```
RuntimeError: setup_test_environment() was already called and can't be called again without first calling teardown_test_environment().
```
This indicates that there is a logical error in the test setup and teardown procedure, unrelated to the core functionality of the `FileInput` class.

#### Patched Output
The patched test output is identical to the original:
```
RuntimeError: setup_test_environment() was already called and can't be called again without first calling teardown_test_environment().
```
The same runtime error persists, suggesting that the modifications in the `FileInput` class were not tested adequately due to the test setup issue.

### Conclusion
The patch itself seems appropriate for addressing the reported issue, but the test setup error prevents us from confirming if the patch resolves the actual issue with the 'required' attribute in the `FileInput` class. To properly validate the fix, the test setup issue must be rectified first, and then the tests would need to be rerun.

Therefore, based on the current output and situation:
Issue resolved: `False`

To resolve the issue regarding the `UsernameValidator` allowing trailing newlines in usernames, we need to update the regex patterns in both `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` classes.

Below are the patches in the *SEARCH/REPLACE* format:

```python
### django/contrib/auth/validators.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    regex = r'^[\w.@+-]+$'
=======
    regex = r'\A[\w.@+-]+\Z'
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Since the same change needs to be applied to both classes (`ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator`) within the same file, the similar patch applies to both sections of the code.

Here's the JSON format for the edit:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/auth/validators.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    regex = r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'\n=======\n    regex = r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch will ensure that usernames ending with a newline are correctly rejected without disrupting the existing functionality that validates usernames based on alphanumeric and specified special characters.

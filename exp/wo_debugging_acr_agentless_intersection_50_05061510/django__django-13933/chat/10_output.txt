The patch modifies the `ModelChoiceField` class to include the invalid choice value in the error message when a `ValidationError` is raised. The change seems appropriate for the issue described because the error message now includes the invalid value, which wasn't the case before. 

However, both the original and patched outputs indicate a `ModuleNotFoundError` related to the missing module named 'reproducer'. This error prevents the actual test from running, so there is no test output verifying whether the patch effectively fixes the issue. Without executing the test correctly, we cannot confirm if the modification in the `ModelChoiceField` class resolves the problem of showing the invalid choice value in the error message.

To determine if the issue is fixed, the environment setup in the testing script must be corrected to ensure the test runs without errors. Only then can we see if the change to the error message behaves as expected.

Given the current situation where the test doesn't run due to a missing module, we cannot definitively say that the issue is resolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

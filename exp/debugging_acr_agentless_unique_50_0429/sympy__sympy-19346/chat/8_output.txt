To generate the patch, I need to ensure that the `ReprPrinter` class contains methods specifically designed to handle `set` and `dict` objects (`_print_set` and `_print_dict`), and that these are not already implemented. Unfortunately, I currently do not have the code for the `ReprPrinter` class in order to check its methods thoroughly. Therefore, I will retrieve the source code for the `ReprPrinter` class to determine what adjustments are necessary.

```python
search_class_in_file("sympy/printing/printer.py", "ReprPrinter")
```

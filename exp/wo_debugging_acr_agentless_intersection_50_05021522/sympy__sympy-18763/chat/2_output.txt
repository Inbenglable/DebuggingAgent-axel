To resolve the issue, I need to ensure proper parenthesization when converting a `Subs` object to its LaTeX representation. The `latex` method in `sympy/printing/latex.py` file likely uses a class called `LatexPrinter` where this conversion logic might exist. I need to inspect the `LatexPrinter` class to locate the specific method responsible for handling `Subs` objects. Once located, I can modify this method to add the required parentheses. 

I'll start by retrieving the `LatexPrinter` class source code in the `sympy/printing/latex.py` file to locate the exact method handling `Subs`.

```python
search_class_in_file("sympy/printing/latex.py", "LatexPrinter")
```

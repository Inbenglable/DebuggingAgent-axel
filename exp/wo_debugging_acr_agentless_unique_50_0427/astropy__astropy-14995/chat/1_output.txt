To resolve this issue, I need to inspect the source code of the `NDDataRef` class and the method responsible for handling arithmetic operations, especially the multiplication where mask handling logic is implemented. This will help identify why mask propagation is failing when an operand does not have a mask in version 5.3. Therefore, I will proceed to retrieve the source code for the `NDDataRef` class and investigate the relevant method responsible for the arithmetic operations.

I'll start by locating the `NDDataRef` class and then identify the method handling multiplication and mask logic.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("NDDataRef")
search_method_in_codebase("multiply")
```

To resolve the issue regarding the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass in the **astropy** project, I need to understand the implementation of this metaclass. Specifically, I need to see how it uses `inspect.isfunction`, and potentially identify where adjustments can be made to address its behavior with properties.

Here's the plan:
1. Retrieve the source code for the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass, likely located in a file dealing with docstring processing or metaclasses.

Let's fetch the necessary source code:

```python
search_class_in_codebase("InheritDocstrings")
```

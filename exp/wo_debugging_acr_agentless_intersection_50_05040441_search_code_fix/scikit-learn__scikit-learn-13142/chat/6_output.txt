To resolve the issue where `fit_predict` and `predict` return different results when `n_init > 1` for the `GaussianMixture` class, I will adjust the `fit_predict` method to ensure consistency between the parameters used in `fit_predict` and those used by `predict` later.

Here is the necessary change in `gaussian_mixture.py` to ensure the final state achieved in `fit_predict` is used by `predict`.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sklearn/mixture/base.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        return log_resp.argmax(axis=1)\n=======\n        return self.predict(X)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This change makes sure `fit_predict` updates the model parameters to match those used at the end of `fit_predict`, ensuring `predict` will use the exact same parameters for consistency.

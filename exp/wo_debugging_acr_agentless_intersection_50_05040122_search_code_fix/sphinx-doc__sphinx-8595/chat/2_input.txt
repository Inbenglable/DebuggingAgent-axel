autodoc: empty __all__ attribute is ignored
**Describe the bug**
autodoc: empty `__all__` attribute is ignored

**To Reproduce**
```
# example.py
__all__ = []


def foo():
    "docstring"


def bar():
    "docstring"


def baz():
    "docstring"
```
```
# index.rst
.. automodule:: example
   :members:
```

All foo, bar, and baz are shown.

**Expected behavior**
No entries should be shown because `__all__` is empty.

**Your project**
No

**Screenshots**
No

**Environment info**
- OS: Mac
- Python version: 3.9.1
- Sphinx version: HEAD of 3.x
- Sphinx extensions: sphinx.ext.autodoc
- Extra tools: No

**Additional context**
No

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To address this issue, I'll need to examine the Sphinx autodoc implementation, specifically how it deals with the `__all__` attribute when generating documentation for modules. Typically, this involves checking how it retrieves members in the presence of the `__all__` attribute and determining if it distinguishes between an empty `__all__` and no `__all__`.

I will start by looking for relevant methods in the Sphinx codebase that handle the processing of modules and the handling of the `__all__` attribute.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("process_docstring")
search_method_in_codebase("get_module_members")
search_method_in_codebase("filter_members")
search_class_in_codebase("ModuleScanner")
search_method_in_codebase("analyzer_for")
```

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

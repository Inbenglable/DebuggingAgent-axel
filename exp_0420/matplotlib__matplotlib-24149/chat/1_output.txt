Let's start by creating a minimal debugging test based on the reproduce script provided in the issue report. This will help us isolate the problematic code and gather necessary runtime information.

Here's the debugging test in JSON format:

```json
{
"debugging_test" : "import numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nf, ax = plt.subplots()\ntry:\n    ax.bar([np.nan], [np.nan])\n    print('Bar created successfully')\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print('Error:', e)"
}
```

To determine if the issue is resolved, let's review the patch and analyze the output before and after the patch.

### Patch Review
**Patch Context:**
The patch modifies the `sklearn/mixture/base.py` file. Specifically, it replaces the following line:
```python
return log_resp.argmax(axis=1)
```
with the lines:
```python
labels = log_resp.argmax(axis=1)
self._set_parameters(best_params)  # Ensure consistency with predict
return labels
```

### Analysis of the Patch
- **Original Code**: The original code simply returns the indices where the log responsibilities are maximized.
- **Modified Code**: The patch assigns these indices to `labels`, updates the parameters of the model using `self._set_parameters(best_params)`, and then returns the labels. This patch aims to ensure consistency between `fit_predict` and `predict`.

### Test Output Before the Patch
- `no n_init`: "Arrays equal: True" - This is expected as `n_init` is 1 by default and there should be consistency.
- `n_init=5`: "Arrays equal: False" - Shows disagreement when `n_init` is greater than 1, indicating inconsistency between `fit_predict` and `predict`.

### Test Output After the Patch
- `no n_init`: "Arrays equal: True" - Remains the same as expected.
- `n_init=5`: "Arrays equal: False" - The disagreement still exists despite the patch.

### Conclusion
- The patch did not resolve the inconsistency between `fit_predict` and `predict` when `n_init > 1`. The output after applying the patch is identical to the output before the patch in terms of consistency check, indicating that the issue persists.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the issue is not resolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

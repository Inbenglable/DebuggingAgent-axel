I need to retrieve the source code for the `identify_format` method and understand how `_identifiers` are used, as well as to inspect the `is_fits` function within the `connect.py` file. This will help to identify why the `IndexError` occurs and propose an appropriate fix.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("identify_format")
search_code_in_codebase("is_fits")
search_code_in_codebase("_identifiers")
```

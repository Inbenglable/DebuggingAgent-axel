To fully address the issue and ensure the correct implementation of the fix, it's necessary to understand more about how the `libsvm_sparse.libsvm_sparse_train` function works, as this is where `self.support_vectors_` is populated. This understanding will assist in implementing a robust check for an empty `support_vectors_`.

I need to retrieve more specific information or implementation details about how `libsvm_sparse_train` operates. Given that this is likely part of a library or dependency, this might not be directly available within the visible source code. However, I can check if there's any reference or docstring that further describes its behavior within the project.

As an initial step, I will search the `libsvm_sparse` module within the `sklearn` repository to gather more information about `libsvm_sparse_train`.

```python
search_code_in_codebase("libsvm_sparse_train")
```

To resolve the issue, we need to locate the `trim_docstring` function in the Django codebase, as this function is mentioned in the issue description. Once we locate this function, we can modify its behavior according to the proposed solution. Therefore, I need to search for the method `trim_docstring` in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("trim_docstring")
```

To address the issue reported with the `-v` (short verbose) option in Pylint, we need to analyze how the command-line arguments are processed in the context of Pylint's execution. The failure occurs because the short `-v` option is incorrectly expecting an argument, which implies there's an issue with argument parsing logic related to this option.

The traceback shows a sequence of calls leading up to the `SystemExit` due to improper argument handling, and it appears to be related to how the arguments are parsed and processed. Our ultimate goal is to find where the `-v` option is defined/configured and ensure it's set up correctly to behave like `--verbose` without requiring an argument.

### Analysis:
1. **Observation of the Config Initialization**:
   - The `SystemExit` occurs as part of `_config_initialization` where the short option `-v` is misconfigured.
   
2. **Parsing Command Line Configuration**:
   - The issue arises during `_parse_command_line_configuration`, where argument definitions are processed.
   
3. **Source of Error**:
   - The error explicitly comes from the `argparse` processing in Python where the `_v` option is being processed.
   
The error involving `argparse.ArgumentError` indicates a misconfiguration of the argument flags. The stack trace points to two critical segments:
- `pylint/config/config_initialization.py` in `_config_initialization`
- `pylint/config/arguments_manager.py` in `_parse_command_line_configuration`

It will be essential to examine how Pylint's command-line options are initialized and parsed. This likely includes the location where the command-line arguments are defined and set up, most likely located in or accessed by one of these functions.

### Location of Buggy Method (Hypothesis):
Based on the current analysis, the likely location for the buggy handling of the `-v` option will be around the argument setup and parsing process.

We will first need to observe the command-line argument parsing to understand its specifics. Therefore, the next step focuses on:

```plaintext
Observed method: pylint/config/arguments_manager.py:_parse_command_line_configuration
```

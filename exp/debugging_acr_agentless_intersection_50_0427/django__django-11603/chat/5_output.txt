Based on the information provided and the traceback, the issue in your testing script arises from the fact that Django's application registry is not ready when attempting to define and use the `TestModel`. This is indicated by the `AppRegistryNotReady` exception.

The underlying problem is because Django hasn't been fully set up before defining or using models. Specifically, the script does not call `django.setup()` after configuring the settings but before using models, triggering database operations, or conducting migrations.

The traceback shows that the error occurs specifically at the point where `apps.get_containing_app_config` is called within `ModelBase.__new__` while checking if apps are ready using `check_apps_ready()` method.

Here's the debugging thought process:

1. Your script attempts to define a Django model without ensuring that all necessary Django applications have been initialized. The function `django.setup()` is crucial to ensure that Django’s app registry is populated and all apps are ready.
   
2. The current method `Apps.get_containing_app_config` at line 252 calls `check_apps_ready()`, which raises the exception because it verifies whether the app registry setup has been completed, which hasn’t been initiated correctly here.

Since this issue is related to Django's core functionality where the initialization of apps is checked, the solution involves ensuring correct initialization rather than identifying a bug within Django itself. 

Therefore, the solution calls for the script to execute `django.setup()` prior to defining the test class and working with models.

**Identified Next Step**: 

Calling `django.setup()` should occur directly after configuring settings and before any migrations or model definitions, typically in a standard Python script setup before models are used or the ORM is accessed.

Buggy method: `your_script.py` - The point in the script where you configure Django and follow up with `django.setup()`.

If you need to trace internal calls inside Django due to another issue, please specify the area that needs deeper exploration. Otherwise, adjust the script to initialize Django correctly.

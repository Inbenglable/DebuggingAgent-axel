Based on the information gathered, the `Dataset.merge` method, when invoked, utilizes the `dataset_merge_method` which expects a `CoercibleMapping` as its `other` parameter. However, there's an attempt to iterate over `other` using the `.items()` method, which fails when `other` is a `DataArray`. Thus, it seems that `DataArray` is not appropriately handled as a valid input.

To resolve this, I may need to modify the `dataset_merge_method` to accommodate `DataArray` objects. Before proceeding with the patch, it would be wise to:

1. Check the implementation of `merge_core` in `xarray/core/merge.py` to understand how the merging is handled to ensure any necessary changes account for differences in handling `Dataset` vs. `DataArray`.
2. Confirm if any conversion logic for `DataArray` to `Dataset` might already exist elsewhere that can be leveraged rather than reinventing a solution.

I will search for the `merge_core` method in `xarray/core/merge.py` to gather additional context.

```python
search_method_in_file("xarray/core/merge.py", "merge_core")
```

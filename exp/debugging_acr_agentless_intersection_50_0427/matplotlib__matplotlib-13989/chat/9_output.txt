To fix the issue with `range` not being respected when `density=True`, we can adjust the `hist_kwargs` creation process to ensure the `range` parameter is always included, even when density is turned on. This requires modifying the segment of the code that initializes `hist_kwargs`.

Here is the necessary change:

```pythony
### lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        density = bool(density) or bool(normed)
        if density and not stacked:
            hist_kwargs = dict(density=density)
=======
        density = bool(density) or bool(normed)
        if density and not stacked:
            hist_kwargs['density'] = density
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

With this change, `hist_kwargs` will continue to maintain all previous settings including `range`, while also recognizing and applying density settings. This ensures the `range` parameter is not lost when `density=True`.

Here is the JSON representation of this change:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        density = bool(density) or bool(normed)\n        if density and not stacked:\n            hist_kwargs = dict(density=density)\n=======\n        density = bool(density) or bool(normed)\n        if density and not stacked:\n            hist_kwargs['density'] = density\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

To effectively address the issue, I need to examine the `FileInput` class in `django/forms/widgets.py` to verify if the `use_required_attribute` method needs to be implemented or adjusted. Although I have found the `ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute` method, I haven't found an implementation for `FileInput`. I will now retrieve the definition of the `FileInput` class, which will help me determine how to integrate the required logic. 

```python
search_class_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "FileInput")
```

To resolve the issue, I need to inspect the source code of the `_rename` method in the `RenameContentType` class, located in the file `django/contrib/contenttypes/management/__init__.py`. This will allow me to understand the current implementation and verify if changes are necessary as suspected. 

Therefore, I'll proceed to retrieve the specific source code for this method. 

```python
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/contenttypes/management/__init__.py", "RenameContentType._rename")
```

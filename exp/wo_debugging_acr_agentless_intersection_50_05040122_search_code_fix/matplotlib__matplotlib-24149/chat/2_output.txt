To resolve this issue, it is necessary to understand the behavior of the `ax.bar` method and how it interacts with inputs containing NaN values. Given that the error likely originates from changes in how bars are rendered when encountering NaN values, we should inspect the `_convert_dx` method in the `Axes` class, as this is where the error traceback indicates a problem. I need to gather the source code for the `Axes.bar` method and potentially the `_convert_dx` method within the `axes/_axes.py` file to comprehend how NaN values are processed and adjust logic if needed.

Let's retrieve the source code for those methods to proceed with the fix.

```python
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py", "Axes.bar")
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py", "Axes._convert_dx")
```

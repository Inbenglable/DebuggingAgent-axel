To resolve the issue, I need to review the implementation details of `TemplateView.get_context_data` and understand how `SimpleLazyObject` is returned in Django 3.1. This might involve checking how `SimpleLazyObject` is used or if any changes occurred around it during the transition from Django 3.0 to 3.1.

I will start by searching for the `get_context_data` method in the Django codebase to understand how it operates in the `TemplateView`.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("TemplateView.get_context_data")
```

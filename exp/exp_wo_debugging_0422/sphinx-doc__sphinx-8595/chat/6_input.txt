#### ISSUE
autodoc: empty __all__ attribute is ignored
**Describe the bug**
autodoc: empty `__all__` attribute is ignored

**To Reproduce**
```
# example.py
__all__ = []


def foo():
    "docstring"


def bar():
    "docstring"


def baz():
    "docstring"
```
```
# index.rst
.. automodule:: example
   :members:
```

All foo, bar, and baz are shown.

**Expected behavior**
No entries should be shown because `__all__` is empty.

**Your project**
No

**Screenshots**
No

**Environment info**
- OS: Mac
- Python version: 3.9.1
- Sphinx version: HEAD of 3.x
- Sphinx extensions: sphinx.ext.autodoc
- Extra tools: No

**Additional context**
No

==================================================
Your Output:
To address the issue of the `autodoc` extension not taking an empty `__all__` into account, we need to inspect how `autodoc` processes the `__all__` attribute of a module. This likely involves identifying where `autodoc` checks for `__all__` and modifies the logic so that an empty `__all__` results in no entries being documented.

To start resolving this, I need to review the `autodoc` code related to handling the `__all__` attribute. Since we're dealing with the Sphinx `autodoc` extension, the relevant logic might be in a module related to how members are extracted for documentation.

I will search for methods or classes in the `autodoc` implementation that might relate to processing `__all__` and module members. I will first attempt to retrieve any relevant method or class directly handling this logic.

==================================================

Your Output:
To fix the issue where `autodoc` is not respecting an empty `__all__` attribute, we need to modify the logic in the `filter_members` method. This method is responsible for filtering which members of a module are documented by `autodoc`.

The current implementation checks whether a member is to be kept based on being explicitly specified or if the `want_all` flag is set. We need to adjust the logic to account for an explicitly empty `__all__` list, meaning that no members should be included in the documentation.

Based on the information, the `Documenter.filter_members` method appears to be the right place to make changes. We should check the `__all__` attribute if it exists and is empty, and ensure no members are documented in this case.

Code retrieval is not necessary beyond what we've already seen since we have the relevant parts needed to understand and modify the logic. Therefore, I am ready to proceed with creating a patch.

Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

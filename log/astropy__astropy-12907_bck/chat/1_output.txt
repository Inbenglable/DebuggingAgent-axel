To start with identifying the issue in the `separability_matrix` function, we will create a minimal debugging test based on the reproducible test provided. This test will help us narrow down the problem and observe the behavior of the function in different scenarios.

Here is the minimal debugging test:

```json
{
  "debugging_test": "import numpy as np\nfrom astropy.modeling import models as m\nfrom astropy.modeling.separable import separability_matrix\n\n# Test 1: Simple compound model\ncm = m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)\nprint(\"\\nTest 1: Simple compound model\")\nprint(separability_matrix(cm))\n\n# Test 2: Complex model without nesting\nprint(\"\\nTest 2: Complex model without nesting\")\nprint(separability_matrix(m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)))\n\n# Test 3: Nested compound model\nprint(\"\\nTest 3: Nested compound model\")\nprint(separability_matrix(m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm))\n\n# Additional information\nprint(\"\\nAdditional Information: Checking inputs, outputs and other properties of the models\")\nprint(\"Inputs and outputs of simple compound model:\")\nprint(cm.inputs)\nprint(cm.outputs)\n\nnested_cm = m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm\nprint(\"\\nInputs and outputs of nested compound model:\")\nprint(nested_cm.inputs)\nprint(nested_cm.outputs)\n\nprint(\"Separability matrix of models individually:\")\nprint(\"Pix2Sky_TAN:\")\nprint(separability_matrix(m.Pix2Sky_TAN()))\nprint(\"Linear1D(10):\")\nprint(separability_matrix(m.Linear1D(10)))\nprint(\"Linear1D(5):\")\nprint(separability_matrix(m.Linear1D(5)))\n"
}
```

Explanation:
- This script will print the separability matrix for the simple compound model, the complex model without nesting, and the nested compound model.
- Additionally, it will print the inputs and outputs of both the simple compound model and the nested compound model.
- It will also separately print the separability matrices for the individual models used in these tests.

By running this test, we should be able to gather sufficient information to identify the root cause of the issue in the `separability_matrix` function. The additional information about inputs and outputs will help in understanding why the nested compound model is resulting in unexpected behavior.

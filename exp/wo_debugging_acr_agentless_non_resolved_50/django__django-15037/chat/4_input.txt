## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Foreign key to a specific field is not handled in inspectdb
Description
	 
		(last modified by Tim Graham)
	 
if you have a DB like that
CREATE TABLE foo ( id serial primary key, other_id int UNIQUE);
CREATE TABLE bar (
	id serial primary key, other_id int,
	constraint myconst 
	FOREIGN KEY(other_id) references foo(other_id)
);
the generated model for the bar table will have the other_id be a FK to foo and not foo(other_id).
I'm attaching a potential fix for this. Sorry I had no time for the UTs.

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To fix the issue related to `inspectdb` handling foreign keys to specific fields, I need to check the implementation of `inspectdb` functionality in Django's codebase. Specifically, I need to find where the models are created based on the database schema, which includes the handling of foreign keys. Therefore, I will need to search for the relevant source code that deals with model generation from a database.

I'm particularly interested in finding how fields, especially foreign keys, are handled and how their references are resolved during the inspection process. This could involve methods related to database introspection and schema conversion.

Thus, I will begin by searching for relevant methods, especially focusing on `inspectdb` functionality within Django's management commands. The file likely involved is `django/core/management/sql.py` or similar.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("inspectdb")
search_method_in_codebase("Field.foreign_key")
search_method_in_codebase("get_field_type")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("get_field_type")
RESULT:
#### django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py:Command.get_field_type
```python
    def get_field_type(self, connection, table_name, row):
        """
        Given the database connection, the table name, and the cursor row
        description, this routine will return the given field type name, as
        well as any additional keyword parameters and notes for the field.
        """
        field_params = {}
        field_notes = []

        try:
            field_type = connection.introspection.get_field_type(row.type_code, row)
        except KeyError:
            field_type = 'TextField'
            field_notes.append('This field type is a guess.')

        # Add max_length for all CharFields.
        if field_type == 'CharField' and row.internal_size:
            field_params['max_length'] = int(row.internal_size)

        if field_type in {'CharField', 'TextField'} and row.collation:
            field_params['db_collation'] = row.collation

        if field_type == 'DecimalField':
            if row.precision is None or row.scale is None:
                field_notes.append(
                    'max_digits and decimal_places have been guessed, as this '
                    'database handles decimal fields as float')
                field_params['max_digits'] = row.precision if row.precision is not None else 10
                field_params['decimal_places'] = row.scale if row.scale is not None else 5
            else:
                field_params['max_digits'] = row.precision
                field_params['decimal_places'] = row.scale

        return field_type, field_params, field_notes

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

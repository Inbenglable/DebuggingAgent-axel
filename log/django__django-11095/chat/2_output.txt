Based on the observed error, it seems the test script is encountering an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception. This exception is raised when Django attempts to access settings, in this case, `INSTALLED_APPS`, but the Django settings have not been properly configured. The error suggests that the environment variable `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` has not been set, or the settings have not been configured using `settings.configure()`.

This is a common issue when running Django tests or scripts outside of the standard environment where `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` would usually be set to point to an existing settings file, typically in `manage.py` or `wsgi.py`. 

Considering this, the script should be configured to use Django settings before any model definitions or imports that rely on Django settings. This can usually be done at the beginning of the script.

The observed abnormal behavior leads us to first ensure the Django settings configuration is correct before proceeding to deeper issues related to the hook implementation.

Observed method: `django/conf/__init__.py:_setup`

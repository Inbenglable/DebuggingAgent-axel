To address the issue of `SimpleLazyObject` being returned when using `TemplateView.get_context_data()`, which leads to a crash during filtration, we should explicitly convert the `offer_slug` to a string within the `get_context_data()` method as follows:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### reproduce.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        offer_slug = kwargs.get(\"offer_slug\", \"\")\n=======\n        offer_slug = str(kwargs.get(\"offer_slug\", \"\"))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This fix ensures that `offer_slug` is properly converted to a string, thus preventing crashes related to unsupported types when filtering.

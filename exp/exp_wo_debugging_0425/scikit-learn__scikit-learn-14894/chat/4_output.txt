I have gathered the necessary information regarding the `_sparse_fit` method, which is causing the ZeroDivisionError. The issue arises specifically with the construction of `dual_coef_indptr`, as it involves division using `n_class`, which can be zero when no support vectors are found.

The patch needs to ensure that this division does not occur when `support_vectors_` is empty, thus preventing the ZeroDivisionError.

I am ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

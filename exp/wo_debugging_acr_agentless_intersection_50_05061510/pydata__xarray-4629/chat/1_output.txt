I need to retrieve the source code around the issue in the `xarray` project. The issue pertains to the handling of `combine_attrs='override'` in the `merge` function. The reference suggests that the problem might be in the line `return variable_attrs[0]`, which should be changed to `return dict(variable_attrs[0])`.

To proceed with generating a patch, I need to locate the `merge` function in the `xarray/core/merge.py` file, which seems to be the file mentioned that contains the issue.

```python
search_method_in_file("xarray/core/merge.py", "merge")
```

Analyzing the API returned contents:

1. **reproduce.py:113-119**: This snippet is a part of a script setting the `autodoc_typehints` to "description". It helps in reproducing the issue but is not directly related to the code that processes or affects the `autodoc_typehints` setting in Sphinx.

2. **docs/conf.py:55-58**: This snippet shows the configuration setting `autodoc_typehints = "description"` in the Sphinx config file. It is used to reproduce the issue but does not provide insights into the implementation of the feature.

3. **tests/test_ext_autodoc_configs.py:1486-1492**: This test appears to be related to checking the format of type hints. However, this test doesn't directly address how `autodoc_typehints = "description"` affects the return type in the context of `autoclass`.

4. **sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py:60-66**: This code snippet appears to be modifying field lists based on the `autodoc_typehints_description_target` configuration. This is directly related to processing or affecting the `autodoc_typehints` setting and is thus relevant for addressing the issue.

5. **sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:2819-2825**: This snippet shows the addition of config values related to `autodoc_typehints_description_target` and `autodoc_typehints_format`. It gives context on configuration options related to type hints in the `autodoc` extension which is relevant for the bug.

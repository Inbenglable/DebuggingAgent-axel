You need to trace the abnormal program to resolve project issues and submit pull requests.
Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
docutils reports an error rendering view docstring when the first line is not empty
Description
	
Currently admindoc works correctly only with docstrings where the first line is empty, and all Django docstrings are formatted in this way.
However usually the docstring text starts at the first line, e.g.:
def test():
	"""test tests something.
	"""
and this cause an error:
Error in "default-role" directive:
no content permitted.
.. default-role:: cmsreference
The culprit is this code in trim_docstring:
indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())
The problem is that the indentation of the first line is 0.
The solution is to skip the first line:
indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())
Thanks.

You need to trace the abnormal program behavior step by step to identify the root cause of the bug and locate the buggy method that contains the code to be fixed.
Now, please first analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior. 

Then, if you can already locate the buggy method and buggy code, reply with:
Buggy method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Otherwise, continue tracing by selecting the next method to observe. Reply with: 
Observed method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Note that {FILE_PATH} refers to the path relative to the repository. And if you want to observe a method inside a class, please specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME.

Based on the issue description and the provided code for the `trim_docstring` function, we need to modify the logic for calculating the indentation by skipping the first line of the docstring. Here's the required patch in the *SEARCH/REPLACE* format:

```pythony
### django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())
=======
    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's format the edit into the JSON response:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())\n=======\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

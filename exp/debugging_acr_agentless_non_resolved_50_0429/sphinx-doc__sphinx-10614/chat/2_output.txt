The behavior seems to be related to how links in SVG images are generated relative to the embedding HTML file. The `InheritanceDiagram.run` method generates the graph and uses class role references to create nodes for each class in the inheritance diagram. The SVG's link generation could be tied to how it resolves these references.

To further understand why the links generated within SVG images are incorrect, it may be useful to look deeper into how the `InheritanceGraph` is constructed and how it generates the inheritance diagram and links. The next logical step would be to examine the `InheritanceGraph` class methods, especially those involved with link generation.

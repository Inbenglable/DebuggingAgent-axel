To address the ZeroDivisionError in the `_sparse_fit` method, I need to examine additional relevant parts of the code, specifically focusing on how `dual_coef_indices` and `dual_coef_indptr` are constructed. This is crucial to ensure these arrays can handle cases where `support_vectors_` is empty and thus avoid division by zero. It seems the existing code is within the `BaseLibSVM` class in `sklearn/svm/base.py`. 

To gain a comprehensive understanding of this issue, I need to review the `BaseLibSVM` class to understand its members and any additional methods that might interplay with `_sparse_fit`.

```python
search_class_in_file("sklearn/svm/base.py", "BaseLibSVM")
```

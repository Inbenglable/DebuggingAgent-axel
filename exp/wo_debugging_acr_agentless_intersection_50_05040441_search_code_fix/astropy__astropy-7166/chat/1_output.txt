To address the issue with the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass and its interaction with properties, I need to examine the implementation of the `InheritDocstrings` class. This will allow me to understand how it currently handles function objects and where it might need modifications to accommodate properties as well.

Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code for the `InheritDocstrings` class.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("InheritDocstrings")
```

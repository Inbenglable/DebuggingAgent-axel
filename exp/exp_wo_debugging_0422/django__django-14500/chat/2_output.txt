To address the issue, I need to examine the logic behind the `unapply_migration` method in the `MigrationExecutor` class, as it is likely responsible for marking squashed migrations and their replacements as unapplied. Let's retrieve the source code for this method to understand and resolve the issue. 

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/executor.py", "MigrationExecutor.unapply_migration")
```

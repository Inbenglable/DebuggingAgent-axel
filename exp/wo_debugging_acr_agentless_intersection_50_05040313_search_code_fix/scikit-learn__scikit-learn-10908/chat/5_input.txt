This is the bug issue, which is in the **scikit-learn** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
CountVectorizer's get_feature_names raise not NotFittedError when the vocabulary parameter is provided
If you initialize a `CounterVectorizer` and try to perform a transformation without training you will get a `NotFittedError` exception.

```python
In [1]: from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
In [2]: vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
In [3]: corpus = [
    ...:     'This is the first document.',
    ...:     'This is the second second document.',
    ...:     'And the third one.',
    ...:     'Is this the first document?',
    ...: ]

In [4]: vectorizer.transform(corpus)
NotFittedError: CountVectorizer - Vocabulary wasn't fitted.
```
On the other hand if you provide the `vocabulary` at the initialization of the vectorizer you could transform a corpus without a prior training, right?

```python
In [1]: from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

In [2]: vectorizer = CountVectorizer()

In [3]: corpus = [
    ...:     'This is the first document.',
    ...:     'This is the second second document.',
    ...:     'And the third one.',
    ...:     'Is this the first document?',
    ...: ]

In [4]: vocabulary = ['and', 'document', 'first', 'is', 'one', 'second', 'the', 'third', 'this']

In [5]: vectorizer = CountVectorizer(vocabulary=vocabulary)

In [6]: hasattr(vectorizer, "vocabulary_")
Out[6]: False

In [7]: vectorizer.get_feature_names()
NotFittedError: CountVectorizer - Vocabulary wasn't fitted.

In [8]: vectorizer.transform(corpus)
Out[8]:
<4x9 sparse matrix of type '<class 'numpy.int64'>'
        with 19 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Row format>

In [9]: hasattr(vectorizer, "vocabulary_")
Out[9]: True
```

The `CountVectorizer`'s `transform` calls `_validate_vocabulary` method which sets the `vocabulary_` instance variable.

In the same manner I believe that the `get_feature_names` method should not raise `NotFittedError` if the vocabulary parameter is provided but the vectorizer has not been trained.

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
## REPRODUCE TEST
```
import traceback
import sys
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    corpus = [
        'This is the first document.',
        'This is the second second document.',
        'And the third one.',
        'Is this the first document?',
    ]
    vocabulary = ['and', 'document', 'first', 'is', 'one', 'second', 'the', 'third', 'this']
    
    vectorizer = CountVectorizer(vocabulary=vocabulary)
    
    try:
        # This should not raise an error as per the expectation, but it does
        feature_names = vectorizer.get_feature_names()
        print("Feature names:", feature_names)
        # If the above line does not raise an error, the issue is fixed
        print("The issue is fixed.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "get_feature_names() raised an exception when it should not have"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

And this is the original output when running the test (before applying the patch):
## ORIGINAL OUTPUT

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

```

The repair agent has tried to generate a patch to fix the issue:
## PATCH CONTEXT
<PATCH_CONTEXT>
To address the issue, we need to modify the `get_feature_names` method in the `CountVectorizer` class. The current method raises a `NotFittedError` when `vocabulary_` is not set, but if a vocabulary was provided at initialization, it should not raise this error.

The fix involves checking if the `vocabulary` attribute was provided initially, and if so, using that vocabulary to generate feature names without raising `NotFittedError`.

Here's the necessary patch:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        self._check_vocabulary()\n=======\n        if not hasattr(self, 'vocabulary_'):\n            if self.vocabulary is not None:\n                self.vocabulary_ = self.vocabulary if isinstance(self.vocabulary, dict) else {v: i for i, v in enumerate(self.vocabulary)}\n            else:\n                self._check_vocabulary()\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This change alters the `get_feature_names` method to handle the scenario where a vocabulary is provided at initialization properly. It ensures that the method will not raise a `NotFittedError` if a vocabulary was set and uses that vocabulary for returning feature names.
</PATCH_CONTEXT>

After applying the patch, the output of the test is:
## PATCHED OUTPUT
```
Feature names: ['and', 'document', 'first', 'is', 'one', 'second', 'the', 'third', 'this']
The issue is fixed.

```

Now, please first review the patch and analyse the test output before and after the patch, to determine whether the issue is fixed or not.

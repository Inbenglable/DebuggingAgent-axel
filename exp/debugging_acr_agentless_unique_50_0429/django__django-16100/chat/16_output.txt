To resolve the issue of ensuring that the `changelist_view` in Django admin is wrapped in a database transaction, I've located the source code for the `changelist_view` method. Currently, the method performs various operations, including handling POSTed data, validating a formset, and performing database changes through model saves.

To address this issue, I need to ensure these operations that alter the database are wrapped within a transaction. A transaction will ensure that if any error occurs during the process, the database changes are rolled back, preserving data consistency.

The typical approach would be to use Django's `transaction.atomic()` in order to wrap the relevant logic that modifies the database. This modification is straightforward and requires wrapping the portion of the code where database modifications occur within a transaction block.

Since I have obtained the source code for `ModelAdmin.changelist_view`, I am ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

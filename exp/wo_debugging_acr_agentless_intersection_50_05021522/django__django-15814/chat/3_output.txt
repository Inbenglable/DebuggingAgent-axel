To generate the patch for this issue, I need to examine the context around the code where `opts = cur_model._meta` is used. Since I've already retrieved some of this portion of the code, it would be beneficial to have a fuller context around line 745 in the `django/db/models/sql/query.py` file. This will help to understand the logic and connections around this part of the file, which deals with `select_related` functionality.

Given this, I will proceed with retrieving additional context from the file to ensure a comprehensive understanding before generating the patch.

```python
search_code_in_file("django/db/models/sql/query.py", "cur_model = source.related_model")
```

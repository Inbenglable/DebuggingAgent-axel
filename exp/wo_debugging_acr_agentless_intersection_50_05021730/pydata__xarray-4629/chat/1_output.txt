To resolve the issue with `merge(combine_attrs='override')`, I need to explore the implementation of the `merge` function in the `xarray` project to understand how the `combine_attrs` logic is currently handled.

Given your description, the problematic line seems to be related to the `override` case in the merge logic. To gather the necessary information, I will retrieve the source code for the `merge` method in the `xarray/core/merge.py` file.

Let's proceed with searching for the `merge` method in the specified file:

```python
search_method_in_file("xarray/core/merge.py", "merge")
```

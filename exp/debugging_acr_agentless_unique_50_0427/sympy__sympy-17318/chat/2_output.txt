Analyzing the provided code for the `_split_gcd` function and the runtime information:

The core idea behind `_split_gcd` is to divide a list of integers `a` into two lists: `a1`, which has a common divisor `g`, and `a2`, whose elements are not divisible by `g`. 

However, from the traceback, it is clear that the `IndexError` occurs because `a[0]` is accessed without checking if `a` is non-empty. This could happen if `_split_gcd` is called with an empty list of integers, leading directly to an `IndexError`.

The next logical step is to check why `_split_gcd` is being called with an empty list. This usually stems from the upstream processing or assumptions within `split_surds` or other related functions. Therefore, understanding the invocation and arguments passed to `_split_gcd` would be crucial.

Given this reasoning, the immediate scope to understand would involve how `_split_gcd` is invoked, particularly focusing on the conditions under which it is called. This likely involves `split_surds` where `_split_gcd` is used.

Therefore, I will need to trace the code from the point where `_split_gcd` is invoked with prepared arguments indicating abnormal behavior. For a deeper understanding, the line range in `radsimp.py` related to the invocation and argument preparation would be pertinent.

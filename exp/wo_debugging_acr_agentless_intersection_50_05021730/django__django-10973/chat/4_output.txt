Since the initial attempts to locate the `client` method within Django's PostgreSQL backend have yielded no relevant results, I need to search for the method again, possibly within a different scope or by considering specific class context. Given my understanding, we should be searching within the Django PostgreSQL backend files.

Let's try locating the `client` method within the context of the `PostgreSQLDatabaseWrapper` class, which is a more specific and likely location of where the command execution is handled.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("PostgreSQLDatabaseWrapper.client")
search_class_in_codebase("DatabaseClient")
```

To resolve the issue described, we need to add the `__iter__` method to the `Paginator` class. Before generating the patch, we need to retrieve the source code of the `Paginator` class to understand its structure and ensure we are modifying it correctly. 

Since we don't know the specific file where the `Paginator` class is located, we should search for the class code in the whole project codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Paginator")
```

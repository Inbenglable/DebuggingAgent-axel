To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve source code for some relevant methods and classes to understand how Django handles `ALTER TABLE` operations specifically for the SQLite backend. The goal is to identify how to bypass or manage the SQLite limitation regarding adding UNIQUE columns with `ALTER TABLE`.

First, I will get the source code for the `SQLiteCursorWrapper` class to investigate its `execute` method since the error originates there, and then for the `add_field` method in the `DatabaseSchemaEditor` class within the SQLite backend to examine how fields are added.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py", "SQLiteCursorWrapper")
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py", "DatabaseSchemaEditor.add_field")
```

In the error traceback, we see a KeyError in the `generate_renamed_models` method when it tries to delete the 'to' key from the `deconstruction` dictionary. To address this, the suggestion is to use the pop method to remove the key, which gracefully handles cases where the key isn't present by returning None instead.

To make this fix, I need to retrieve the `generate_renamed_models` method's source code within the `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` file. This will allow me to understand the context and introduce the patch correctly.

I'll proceed by requesting the relevant source code.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/autodetector.py", "MigrationAutodetector.generate_renamed_models")
```

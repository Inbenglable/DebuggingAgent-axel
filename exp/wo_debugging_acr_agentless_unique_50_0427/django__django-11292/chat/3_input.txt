## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Add --skip-checks option to management commands.
Description
	
Management commands already have skip_checks stealth option. I propose exposing this option on the command line. This would allow users to skip checks when running a command from the command line. Sometimes in a development environment, it is nice to move ahead with a task at hand rather than getting side tracked fixing a system check.

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve this issue, I will need to examine how management commands are currently implemented in the Django project. Specifically, I need to look at how options are defined and processed within these commands in order to introduce the `--skip-checks` option. Typically, management commands are implemented extending Djangoâ€™s `BaseCommand` or with custom command classes.

First, I'll search for `BaseCommand` class, where options for management commands are usually defined and handled. 

```python
search_class_in_codebase("BaseCommand")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_class_in_codebase("BaseCommand")
RESULT:
#### django/core/management/base.py:BaseCommand
```python
class BaseCommand:
    """
    The base class from which all management commands ultimately
    derive.

    Use this class if you want access to all of the mechanisms which
    parse the command-line arguments and work out what code to call in
    response; if you don't need to change any of that behavior,
    consider using one of the subclasses defined in this file.

    If you are interested in overriding/customizing various aspects of
    the command-parsing and -execution behavior, the normal flow works
    as follows:

    1. ``django-admin`` or ``manage.py`` loads the command class
       and calls its ``run_from_argv()`` method.

    2. The ``run_from_argv()`` method calls ``create_parser()`` to get
       an ``ArgumentParser`` for the arguments, parses them, performs
       any environment changes requested by options like
       ``pythonpath``, and then calls the ``execute()`` method,
       passing the parsed arguments.

    3. The ``execute()`` method attempts to carry out the command by
       calling the ``handle()`` method with the parsed arguments; any
       output produced by ``handle()`` will be printed to standard
       output and, if the command is intended to produce a block of
       SQL statements, will be wrapped in ``BEGIN`` and ``COMMIT``.

    4. If ``handle()`` or ``execute()`` raised any exception (e.g.
       ``CommandError``), ``run_from_argv()`` will  instead print an error
       message to ``stderr``.

    Thus, the ``handle()`` method is typically the starting point for
    subclasses; many built-in commands and command types either place
    all of their logic in ``handle()``, or perform some additional
    parsing work in ``handle()`` and then delegate from it to more
    specialized methods as needed.

    Several attributes affect behavior at various steps along the way:

    ``help``
        A short description of the command, which will be printed in
        help messages.

    ``output_transaction``
        A boolean indicating whether the command outputs SQL
        statements; if ``True``, the output will automatically be
        wrapped with ``BEGIN;`` and ``COMMIT;``. Default value is
        ``False``.

    ``requires_migrations_checks``
        A boolean; if ``True``, the command prints a warning if the set of
        migrations on disk don't match the migrations in the database.

    ``requires_system_checks``
        A boolean; if ``True``, entire Django project will be checked for errors
        prior to executing the command. Default value is ``True``.
        To validate an individual application's models
        rather than all applications' models, call
        ``self.check(app_configs)`` from ``handle()``, where ``app_configs``
        is the list of application's configuration provided by the
        app registry.

    ``stealth_options``
        A tuple of any options the command uses which aren't defined by the
        argument parser.

==================================================

Your Output:
To implement the `--skip-checks` option effectively, I need to review how command-line arguments are added and processed in the `BaseCommand` class, and particularly examine the methods related to argument creation and execution. The key methods to look into would likely be `add_arguments` and `execute`.

Let's start by retrieving the source code for the `add_arguments` and `execute` methods from the `BaseCommand` class to determine how to incorporate `--skip-checks` into the command options.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/management/base.py", "BaseCommand.add_arguments")
search_method_in_file("django/core/management/base.py", "BaseCommand.execute")

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

To resolve the issue, I need to change how the `method` parameter is handled when it's a Unicode string in Python 2.7. Specifically, I'm interested in `sessions.py:313` where `req.method = method.upper()` is mentioned. To patch this, I need to retrieve and inspect the surrounding code where this assignment takes place to determine the most appropriate fix.

I'll proceed with the search for the relevant code to ensure I have the necessary context before generating the patch.

```python
search_code_in_file("requests/sessions.py", "req.method = method.upper()")
```

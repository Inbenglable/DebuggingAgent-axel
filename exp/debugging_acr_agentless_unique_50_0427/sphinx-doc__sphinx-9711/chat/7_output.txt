To address the issue with version comparison, we need to replace the string comparison with semantic version comparison using `packaging.version.Version`. Here's how you can generate the patch:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### reproduce.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nif required_version > actual_version:\n=======\nfrom packaging.version import Version\n\n    if Version(actual_version) < Version(required_version):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This change will ensure that versions are compared based on their semantic meaning rather than as strings, resolving the issue where `0.10.0` was incorrectly considered less than `0.6.0`.

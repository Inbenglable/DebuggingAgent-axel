Based on the analysis and observations:

1. The code snippet that was observed is the `IsolationForest.__init__` method.
2. Inside this method, the `super().__init__()` call passes parameters to the `BaseBagging` class, including a default value `warm_start=False`.
3. However, the testing code reveals a `ValueError`, indicating that the `warm_start` parameter is not valid for `IsolationForest` when attempting to dynamically set parameter using `set_params`.
4. It seems like the `warm_start` parameter is not being properly exposed in the parameters list of `IsolationForest`.

Considering this analysis, the buggy code exists in the `IsolationForest.__init__` method inside the file `sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py`. 

Therefore, the identified buggy method is:

Buggy method: `sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py:IsolationForest.__init__`

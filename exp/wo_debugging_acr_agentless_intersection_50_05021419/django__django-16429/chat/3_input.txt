## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
timesince() raises TypeError with USE_TZ=True and >1 month interval.
Description
	 
		(last modified by Sage Abdullah)
	 
As of 8d67e16493c903adc9d049141028bc0fff43f8c8, calling timesince() with a datetime object that's one month (or more) in the past and the USE_TZ setting is set to True results in the following crash:
TypeError: can't subtract offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes
Test:
...
class TimesinceTests(TestCase):
	...
	@requires_tz_support
	@override_settings(USE_TZ=True)
	def test_long_interval_with_tz(self):
		now = timezone.now()
		d = now - datetime.timedelta(days=31)
		self.assertEqual(timesince(d), "1\xa0month")
I believe this is because the pivot instantiated here: â€‹https://github.com/django/django/blob/d2310f6473593d28c14b63a72253408b568e100a/django/utils/timesince.py#L93-L100 does not take into account the datetime object's tzinfo. Adding 0, d.tzinfo arguments to the datetime.datetime call seems to fix this.
Happy to send a PR.

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue at hand, I need to first examine the source code of the `timesince` function. This function is likely involved in the problematic code where the `TypeError` occurs, and I need to verify how it handles timezone-aware and timezone-naive datetimes.

I'll start by retrieving the source code for the `timesince` function in the Django project.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("timesince")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("timesince")
RESULT:
#### django/utils/timesince.py:timesince
```python
def timesince(d, now=None, reversed=False, time_strings=None, depth=2):
    """
    Take two datetime objects and return the time between d and now as a nicely
    formatted string, e.g. "10 minutes". If d occurs after now, return
    "0 minutes".

    Units used are years, months, weeks, days, hours, and minutes.
    Seconds and microseconds are ignored.

    The algorithm takes into account the varying duration of years and months.
    There is exactly "1 year, 1 month" between 2013/02/10 and 2014/03/10,
    but also between 2007/08/10 and 2008/09/10 despite the delta being 393 days
    in the former case and 397 in the latter.

    Up to `depth` adjacent units will be displayed.  For example,
    "2 weeks, 3 days" and "1 year, 3 months" are possible outputs, but
    "2 weeks, 3 hours" and "1 year, 5 days" are not.

    `time_strings` is an optional dict of strings to replace the default
    TIME_STRINGS dict.

    `depth` is an optional integer to control the number of adjacent time
    units returned.

Your Output:
Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

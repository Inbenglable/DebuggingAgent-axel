To determine which of the retrieved contents are necessary to resolve the issue, we need to analyze the context and functionality provided by each piece of code related to the `_collect_factor_and_dimension()` method.

Let's examine each one:

1. **sympy/physics/units/quantities.py:Quantity._collect_factor_and_dimension**

   - This method is a deprecated version of the `_collect_factor_and_dimension()` method now moved to the `UnitSystem` class. It suggests using `unit_system._collect_factor_and_dimension(expr)` instead, meaning that the actual and relevant implementation is elsewhere.

2. **sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py:UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension**

   - This is the current implementation of the `_collect_factor_and_dimension()` method in the `UnitSystem` class. It includes logic for handling different types of expressions (e.g., `Mul`, `Pow`, `Add`, `Derivative`, `Function`) and evaluates the dimensions of the expressions. This is directly relevant because the class and method are actually responsible for dimension evaluation and are the likely source of the observed issue.

Based on the analysis, the relevant piece of code needed to address the issue is the second one, because it contains the actual method used for collecting factors and dimensions in the SI unit system. The deprecated version points to this implementation.

Thus, the necessary content is:

```
sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py:UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension
```

To evaluate whether the patch resolves the issue, we need to compare the expected output, the original output before patching, and the patched output after applying the patch.

1. **Expected Output:** The test asserts the type of `q[0]` should be `<class 'sympy.core.function.UndefinedFunction'>`.

2. **Original Output:** Before applying the patch, the test output shows that the type of `q[0]` is `<class 'sympy.core.symbol.Symbol'>`, which is incorrect.

3. **Patched Output:** The test output shows that the type of `q[0]` is `<class 'sympy.core.function.UndefinedFunction'>`, matching the expected outcome.

The patch modifies how the `cls` argument is passed within the recursive call to `symbols(...)`, ensuring it retains the specified class type. Given the modification causes the test to pass, indicating that the created symbol is of the correct type (`UndefinedFunction`), the patch fixes the issue.

Issue resolved: `True`

To address the issue, I need to understand the relevant part of the Sphinx codebase where version comparisons are being handled. Specifically, I need to identify the part of the code that implements the logic for checking extension versions, referred to as `needs_extensions` in the issue description. 

I will start by searching for a method related to extension needs checking or the utility of version comparison.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("needs_extensions")
search_method_in_codebase("compare_versions")
search_method_in_codebase("version_check")
```

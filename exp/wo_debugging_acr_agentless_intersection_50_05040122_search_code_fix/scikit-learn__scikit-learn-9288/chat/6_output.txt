The issue arises from slight numerical differences when using parallel versus sequential computation due to the handling of random seeds and possibly the numerical operations order. Since the `n_jobs` parameter has been deprecated for more recent versions of scikit-learn, a possible resolution is to manage the seeds more deterministically or switch to using joblib's parallel capabilities reliably for both single and multiple threads.

Here's a patch proposal to ensure consistent results regardless of the value of `n_jobs`:

```json

    "### sklearn/cluster/k_means_.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        seeds = random_state.randint(np.iinfo(np.int32).max, size=n_init)\n        results = Parallel(n_jobs=n_jobs, verbose=0)(\n            delayed(kmeans_single)(X, sample_weight, n_clusters,\n                                   max_iter=max_iter, init=init,\n                                   verbose=verbose, tol=tol,\n                                   precompute_distances=precompute_distances,\n                                   x_squared_norms=x_squared_norms,\n                                   # Change seed to ensure variety\n                                   random_state=seed)\n=======\n        seed_seq = np.random.SeedSequence(random_state.randint(np.iinfo(np.int32).max))\n        seeds = seed_seq.spawn(n_init)\n        results = Parallel(n_jobs=n_jobs, verbose=0)(\n            delayed(kmeans_single)(X, sample_weight, n_clusters,\n                                   max_iter=max_iter, init=init,\n                                   verbose=verbose, tol=tol,\n                                   precompute_distances=precompute_distances,\n                                   x_squared_norms=x_squared_norms,\n                                   random_state=seed)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch uses `np.random.SeedSequence` for better reproducibility across parallel runs, addressing the issue of seed variation across different threads. Ensure that NumPy is updated since `SeedSequence` is available from NumPy version 1.17+.

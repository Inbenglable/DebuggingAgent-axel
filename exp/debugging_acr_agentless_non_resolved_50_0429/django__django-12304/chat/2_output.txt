The error is occurring because the Django template engine is attempting to call the `YearInSchool` enum in the template, which leads to a failure since it doesn't receive the required value argument. The issue arises due to the nature of enums being callable, and within Django templates, any callable is called without arguments. 

This unwanted behavior in templates can be avoided by setting `do_not_call_in_templates = True` for enums, which would prevent the Django template engine from calling enums while rendering templates.

Considering this understanding and the issue description, I should evaluate the method responsible for rendering templates and handling callables. Typically, this behavior is managed in the `django.template.base` module. 

To specifically identify the location, let's proceed by observing the template rendering function that evaluates context in the template. This is generally performed in the `Template` class within the `django.template` module.

Observed method: `django/template/base.py:Template.render`

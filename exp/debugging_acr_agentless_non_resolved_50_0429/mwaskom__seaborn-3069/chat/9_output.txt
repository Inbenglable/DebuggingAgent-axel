Let's review the patch and analyze the test output.

### Patch Review:
The patch modifies the logic in `seaborn/_core/plot.py` with the following actions:
1. The logic has been updated to check if a scale is `Nominal`.
2. The boundaries for the axis limits are adjusted (`lo` and `hi`) by adding or subtracting 0.5 when the scale is nominal.
3. These adjusted limits are set to the axis using `ax.set(**{f'{axis}lim': (lo, hi)})`.

### Analysis of Test Output:

#### Original Output:
The original output indicates that the test for the nominal scale boundaries fails:
- The assertion error shows "Nominal scale is not drawn to +/- 0.5 from the first and last tick."

#### Patched Output:
After applying the patch, the output remains unchanged:
- The same assertion error is raised, "Nominal scale is not drawn to +/- 0.5 from the first and last tick."

This means the patch did not resolve the issue since the behavior being tested did not change. Specifically, the modified code should adjust the axis limits when nominal scales are used, but the test output shows that this adjustment has not been successful or applied correctly.

### Conclusion:
The patch does not fix the issue as the expected behavior (drawing scales to +/- 0.5 from the first and last tick) is not achieved according to the test output.

Issue resolved: `False`

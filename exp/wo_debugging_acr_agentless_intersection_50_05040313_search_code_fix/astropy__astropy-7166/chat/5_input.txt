Now You need to reolve the following issue in the **astropy** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
InheritDocstrings metaclass doesn't work for properties
Inside the InheritDocstrings metaclass it uses `inspect.isfunction` which returns `False` for properties.

</ISSUE>


You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue with the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass not handling properties correctly, I first need to review the code for the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass. This will help me understand how it processes docstrings and specifically how it interacts with `inspect.isfunction`.

I need to locate the source code of the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass, which should be in the Astropy codebase. I will use the search APIs to find this class in the codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("InheritDocstrings")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_class_in_codebase("InheritDocstrings")
RESULT:
#### astropy/utils/misc.py:InheritDocstrings
```python
class InheritDocstrings(type):
    """
    This metaclass makes methods of a class automatically have their
    docstrings filled in from the methods they override in the base
    class.

    If the class uses multiple inheritance, the docstring will be
    chosen from the first class in the bases list, in the same way as
    methods are normally resolved in Python.  If this results in
    selecting the wrong docstring, the docstring will need to be
    explicitly included on the method.

    For example::

        >>> from astropy.utils.misc import InheritDocstrings
        >>> class A(metaclass=InheritDocstrings):
        ...     def wiggle(self):
        ...         "Wiggle the thingamajig"
        ...         pass
        >>> class B(A):
        ...     def wiggle(self):
        ...         pass
        >>> B.wiggle.__doc__
        u'Wiggle the thingamajig'
    """

    def __init__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        ...
```


==================================================

Your Output:
To generate the patch for the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass to handle properties, I need to inspect the `__init__` method and any related implementation details. This will help me understand the current logic and how we can extend it to address properties.

Let's retrieve the source code for the `__init__` method of the `InheritDocstrings` class from the file `astropy/utils/misc.py`.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/utils/misc.py", "InheritDocstrings.__init__")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_file("astropy/utils/misc.py", "InheritDocstrings.__init__")
RESULT:
#### astropy/utils/misc.py:InheritDocstrings.__init__
```python
    def __init__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        def is_public_member(key):
            return (
                (key.startswith('__') and key.endswith('__')
                 and len(key) > 4) or
                not key.startswith('_'))

        for key, val in dct.items():
            if (inspect.isfunction(val) and
                is_public_member(key) and
                val.__doc__ is None):
                for base in cls.__mro__[1:]:
                    super_method = getattr(base, key, None)
                    if super_method is not None:
                        val.__doc__ = super_method.__doc__
                        break

        super().__init__(name, bases, dct)

```


==================================================

Your Output:
To generate the patch for the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass to handle properties, I've reviewed the `__init__` method, which currently checks for functions using `inspect.isfunction`. Since properties are not considered functions by this check, we need to extend the logic to include checks for properties using `inspect.isdatadescriptor`. I have enough information to proceed with generating the patch.

Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

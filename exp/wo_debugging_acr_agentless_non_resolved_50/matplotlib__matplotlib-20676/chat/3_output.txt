Based on the inspection of the `SpanSelector` class and its methods, it seems like the issue with the axis limits expanding to include 0 might be related to how the extents are set and updated. Particularly, the `_onmove` and `_draw_shape` methods manipulate the span, and the `extents` setter uses these to update the visual representation of the span. By adjusting the logic within these methods, we can ensure the axes limits are not forcibly adjusted to include 0 when `interactive=True`.

Given that we've retrieved the source code for these critical components, I am ready to proceed with generating the patch to fix the issue.

Ready generation: `True`

The current analysis suggests that the issue lies within the handling of non-form errors in FormSets, specifically their CSS class decoration. In Django's `formset_factory`, a formset class is dynamically created with the given parameters and attributes. This part of the code is responsible for configuring the FormSet's behavior and attributes but does not deal directly with error handling or CSS class assignment.

To locate the specific method where the 'nonform' CSS class should be applied to non-form errors, it would be useful to trace further into how non-form errors are generated and processed in the formset.

Since the current information points to the main issue existing beyond merely setting up the FormSet, I am interested in further exploring the error handling specifically for FormSets.

Therefore, the next step is to examine the methods responsible for error processing in FormSets. A likely candidate for this deeper observation would be the methods dealing with the cleaning process and error assignment in FormSets (possibly within the BaseFormSet class).

Observed scope: `django/forms/formsets.py:BaseFormSet:Lin121-Lin191` (illustrative reference for accessing error handling in the BaseFormSet class)

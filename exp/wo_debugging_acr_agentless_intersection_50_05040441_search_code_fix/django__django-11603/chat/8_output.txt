To add DISTINCT support to the `Avg` and `Sum` aggregates in Django, we'll need to make edits that incorporate the `allow_distinct` attribute, similar to how it is used in the `Count` class. Here are the necessary search and replace edits:

```pythony
### django/db/models/aggregates.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):
=======
class Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):
    allow_distinct = True
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```pythony
### django/db/models/aggregates.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):
=======
class Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):
    allow_distinct = True
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Here is the JSON representation of these changes:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):\n=======\nclass Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):\n=======\nclass Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

These modifications add the `allow_distinct` attribute to the `Avg` and `Sum` classes, thereby enabling DISTINCT support for these aggregate functions in Django.

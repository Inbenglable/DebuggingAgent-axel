To resolve the issue, I need to inspect the source code of the `strip_accents_unicode` function to understand how accents are currently being stripped and why it's failing for strings already in NFKD form. Since I don't have the file path, I will search for the method in the whole project codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("strip_accents_unicode")
```

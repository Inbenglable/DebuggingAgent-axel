I have the necessary information to address the issue. I've examined the `Avg` and `Sum` classes, and I now understand they inherit from the `Aggregate` class. The `Aggregate` class has a `distinct` parameter and an `allow_distinct` attribute.

To resolve this issue, I'll need to modify the `Avg` and `Sum` classes to set `allow_distinct = True`. This will allow these aggregates to accept and handle the DISTINCT keyword properly in their aggregations.

Ready generation: `True`

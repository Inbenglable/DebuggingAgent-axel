To determine if the patch resolved the issue, let's review the changes made and the test outputs.

### Patch Analysis
The patch was intended to transform objects of type `xr.DataArray` into `xr.Dataset` within the `dataset_merge_method` function. This should allow the `merge()` method to work with `DataArray` objects like the top-level `merge()` function does. However, the patch introduced a new error:

```python
NameError: name 'xr' is not defined
```

This error arises because the patch attempts to use `xr` without importing it within the context of `merge.py`. For the new condition introduced in the patch (`if isinstance(other, xr.DataArray):`), the `xr` module would need to be imported at the top of the file, which was not done.

### Test Output Before Patch
Before applying the patch, the error with the `ds.merge(da)` method was:

```
AttributeError: 'DataArray' object has no attribute 'items'
```

This correctly indicates the original issue, where the `merge()` method does not handle `DataArray` objects correctly.

### Test Output After Patch
After applying the patch, instead of fixing the original issue, the output showed a different error:

```
NameError: name 'xr' is not defined
```

This error suggests that the attempted solution did not execute as intended due to the missing import, meaning the initial problem is still unresolved and no new functionality is introduced.

### Conclusion
As the patched output still results in a failure due to a missing import leading to a `NameError`, the original issue has not been fixed.

Issue resolved: `False`

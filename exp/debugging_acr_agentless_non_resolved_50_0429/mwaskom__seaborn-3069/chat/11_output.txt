Let's review the patch and test output.

### Patch Review:

1. **Adjustment of Axis Limits for Nominal Scales**:
    - The patch modifies the logic to adjust axis limits when the scale is nominal by checking the type against `Nominal` class, fixing how the boundaries of the scale are calculated.

2. **Grid Visibility Logic**:
    - The patch introduces logic to turn off the grid for axes using Nominal scale within the `_finalize_figure` method.

However, despite these changes, the patch does not seem to affect the output of the test, indicating an incomplete or incorrect implementation of fixes.

### Test Output Analysis:

#### Original Output:

- The test raises an `AssertionError` indicating that the nominal scale is not drawn to +/- 0.5 from the first and last tick.
- This output indicates that the logic for setting axis limits is not being executed correctly.

#### Patched Output:

- The test output remains the same after applying the patch, showing an `AssertionError` for the same condition: "Nominal scale is not drawn to +/- 0.5 from the first and last tick".
- This implies that the patch did not resolve the issue with the nominal scale drawing.

### Conclusion:

Given that the patched output did not change the outcome of the test, indicating that the same assertion fails, the patch did not fix the issue.

Issue resolved: `False`

Here's a proposed patch to fix the overflow issue in the `fowlkes_mallows_score` function. The patch will modify the way the Fowlkes-Mallows score is calculated to avoid the potential integer overflow by computing the geometric mean in a way that avoids large intermediate numbers.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sklearn/metrics/cluster/supervised.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    return tk / np.sqrt(pk * qk) if tk != 0. else 0.\n=======\n    return np.sqrt((tk / pk) * (tk / qk)) if tk != 0. else 0.\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
``` 

This patched implementation will prevent overflow in cases where `pk` and `qk` are very large, while still achieving the correct final result for the Fowlkes-Mallows score.

To resolve the issue where `Contains.as_set()` does not return the correct type, but instead returns a `Contains` object, I need to check the source code for the `Contains` class and its `as_set` method. This will allow me to understand the current implementation and make the necessary modifications.

Since I don't know the file path for the `Contains` class, I'll start by searching for the `Contains` class in the codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Contains")
```

To resolve the issue, I need to access the definitions of the `Avg` and `Sum` classes, as these are the target areas where DISTINCT support needs to be added. Since I have already located the class names along with their file paths, I will now retrieve their source code for review.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Avg")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Sum")
```

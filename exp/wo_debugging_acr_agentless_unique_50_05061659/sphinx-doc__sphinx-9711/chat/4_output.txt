To resolve this issue, we need to examine and possibly modify the code responsible for the `needs_extensions` version comparison in the Sphinx project. We should identify the code where the version strings are being compared and adjust it to utilize a proper version comparison method, such as using Python's `packaging.version` module or `distutils.version`.

First, we have to locate the implementation of the `needs_extensions` version checking logic in the Sphinx repository. As it's a specific functionality related to version checking, it's likely that the relevant logic is encapsulated within a specific method or function. 

Let's initiate a search to locate this method within the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("needs_extensions")
```

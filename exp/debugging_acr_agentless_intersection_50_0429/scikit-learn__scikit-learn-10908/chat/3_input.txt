CountVectorizer's get_feature_names raise not NotFittedError when the vocabulary parameter is provided
If you initialize a `CounterVectorizer` and try to perform a transformation without training you will get a `NotFittedError` exception.

```python
In [1]: from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
In [2]: vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
In [3]: corpus = [
    ...:     'This is the first document.',
    ...:     'This is the second second document.',
    ...:     'And the third one.',
    ...:     'Is this the first document?',
    ...: ]

In [4]: vectorizer.transform(corpus)
NotFittedError: CountVectorizer - Vocabulary wasn't fitted.
```
On the other hand if you provide the `vocabulary` at the initialization of the vectorizer you could transform a corpus without a prior training, right?

```python
In [1]: from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

In [2]: vectorizer = CountVectorizer()

In [3]: corpus = [
    ...:     'This is the first document.',
    ...:     'This is the second second document.',
    ...:     'And the third one.',
    ...:     'Is this the first document?',
    ...: ]

In [4]: vocabulary = ['and', 'document', 'first', 'is', 'one', 'second', 'the', 'third', 'this']

In [5]: vectorizer = CountVectorizer(vocabulary=vocabulary)

In [6]: hasattr(vectorizer, "vocabulary_")
Out[6]: False

In [7]: vectorizer.get_feature_names()
NotFittedError: CountVectorizer - Vocabulary wasn't fitted.

In [8]: vectorizer.transform(corpus)
Out[8]:
<4x9 sparse matrix of type '<class 'numpy.int64'>'
        with 19 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Row format>

In [9]: hasattr(vectorizer, "vocabulary_")
Out[9]: True
```

The `CountVectorizer`'s `transform` calls `_validate_vocabulary` method which sets the `vocabulary_` instance variable.

In the same manner I believe that the `get_feature_names` method should not raise `NotFittedError` if the vocabulary parameter is provided but the vectorizer has not been trained.

This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
The issue stems from the behavior of the `get_feature_names` method in the `CountVectorizer` class when a vocabulary is explicitly provided during initialization. When the vocabulary parameter is given, the `vocabulary_` attribute should be considered as set, allowing `get_feature_names` to return the feature names without raising a `NotFittedError`.

Analyzing the runtime information and the traceback suggests that the call to `self._check_vocabulary()` within the `get_feature_names` method checks for the existence of the `vocabulary_` attribute. However, the `vocabulary_` attribute seems not to be set until after a `transform` operation is performed, even if a vocabulary is supplied during initialization.

Let's trace the method call further to pinpoint why the vocabulary-related logic is insufficient when manually setting a vocabulary. 

Observed method: `sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py:CountVectorizer._check_vocabulary`
==================================================
The current issue arises because the `get_feature_names` method raises a `NotFittedError` when the `vocabulary` is provided at initialization, even though theoretically it should have been considered "fitted". 

In the method `VectorizerMixin._check_vocabulary`, we see that it uses `check_is_fitted(self, 'vocabulary_')` to ensure that the vectorizer is considered fitted. However, if a vocabulary is provided directly, this method will still fail unless something like `transform` is called beforehand, which sets the `vocabulary_` attribute. Normally, when a vocabulary is provided at initialization, the `vocabulary_` should be set directly.

To resolve this, we need to ensure that when a vocabulary is provided during initialization, the `vocabulary_` attribute should be set immediately, thereby considering the vectorizer as fitted.

Given the information and the analysis, it seems the potential adjustment should occur during the initialization or directly in methods that set the vocabulary.

I would like to further inspect the initialization process in the `CountVectorizer` class to verify if the vocabulary is properly set when provided. This would include where the vocabulary is assigned and how attributes like `vocabulary_` are handled.

Let's trace the initialization process. I would like to observe:

Observed scope: `sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py:210-250`

Observed method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Note that {FILE_PATH} refers to the path relative to the repository. And if you want to observe a method inside a class, please specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME.

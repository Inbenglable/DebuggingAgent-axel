Let's review what changes have been made and analyze the test outputs:

### Patch Review:
1. **Type Annotation Update**:
   - The patch updates the method signature to allow `DataArray` as an acceptable type for the `other` parameter.
   - Changed from accepting `"CoercibleMapping"` to accepting `Union["CoercibleMapping", "DataArray"]`.

2. **Handling `DataArray`**:
   - The patch includes a conditional check to determine if the `other` parameter is a `DataArray`.
   - If `other` is a `DataArray`, it converts it to a `Dataset` using `other.to_dataset()`.
   - This conversion allows the existing merge method logic (`dataset_merge_method`) to proceed correctly without encountering the attribute error.

### Test Output Analysis:
- **Original Output**:
  - Before the patch, attempting to merge the `DataArray` using `ds.merge(da)` resulted in an `AttributeError` because `DataArray` does not have an `items` method, indicating the bug is present.

- **Patched Output**:
  - After the patch, the merge function successfully combines the `Dataset` and `DataArray` without errors.
  - The output matches the expected result from using `xr.merge([ds, da])`.

### Conclusion:
The patch successfully addresses the issue by allowing the `ds.merge()` method to handle `DataArray` objects correctly. It eliminates the `AttributeError`, and the merged result matches what is expected.

Issue resolved: `True`

To determine if the issue is fixed, let's review the patch and analyze the test outputs before and after the patch is applied.

### Summary of the Problem

The original issue is an `UnboundLocalError` caused by the variable `kern` being referenced before it is assigned in the `kernS` function.

### Analyzing the Patch

The provided patch adds an initialization of the `kern` variable:

```python
kern = ''
```

This ensures that `kern` is defined before it is used, thus preventing the `UnboundLocalError`.

### Analyzing Test Outputs

- **Original Output:**
  The error trace shows an `UnboundLocalError` occurring at the line where `kern` is used without being assigned.

- **Patched Output:**
  The output is empty, indicating that no exception is raised after applying the patch. This suggests that the `UnboundLocalError` has been resolved.

### Conclusion

The patch successfully initializes the `kern` variable, preventing the `UnboundLocalError`, and the test output reflects that the issue is resolved without raising any exceptions.

Issue resolved: `True`

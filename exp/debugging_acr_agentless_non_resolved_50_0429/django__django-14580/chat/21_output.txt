To assess whether the patch resolved the issue, let's first review what the patch aimed to do. The patch altered `django/db/migrations/serializer.py` by changing the serialization configuration for `models.Model`. The modification was intended to ensure that the necessary import statement (`from django.db import models`) is included in migration files where `models.Model` is referenced.

The original output before the patch showed a `NameError` indicating that `models` was not defined in the migration file. The patched output shows the exact same error, suggesting that the patch did not affect the underlying problem.

Given that the error message was unchanged after applying the patch, it implies that the patch did not successfully resolve the missing import statement issue. Consequently, the issue remains unresolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

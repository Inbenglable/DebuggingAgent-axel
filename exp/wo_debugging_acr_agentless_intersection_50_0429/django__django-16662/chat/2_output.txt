To resolve the issue, the generated migration files need to adhere to Django's import style guidelines, which align with isort defaults. The imports should be grouped by type and ordered correctly.

The process that generates migration files likely contains the logic responsible for creating and ordering imports. In Django, the creation of migration files is usually handled by migration operation classes or methods.

To fix this issue, I need to locate the part of the code responsible for generating migration imports, possibly a method within the Django migration file creation module. Once identified, the method can be modified to reorder imports correctly.

Let's retrieve the relevant code for migration import generation:

```python
search_method_in_codebase("generate_migration_file")
search_method_in_codebase("write_migration_imports")
search_code_in_codebase("Migration file generation")
```

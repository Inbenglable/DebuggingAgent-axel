Based on the issue description and the traceback, the problem seems to be happening inside the `Axes.bar` method, particularly with handling NaN values in the `x0` variable. This is happening due to a problem in the `_convert_dx` method trying to find the first finite value using `cbook._safe_first_finite`.

To resolve this issue, I need to:
1. Get the source code for the `Axes.bar` method.
2. Look into the `_convert_dx` method of the `Axes` class used in the `bar` method.
3. Check the `_safe_first_finite` function implementation in `cbook`.

I will retrieve the source code for these methods to understand the issue thoroughly.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("Axes.bar")
search_method_in_codebase("Axes._convert_dx")
search_method_in_codebase("_safe_first_finite")
```

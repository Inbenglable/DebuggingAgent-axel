To resolve the issue with the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass not working for properties, we need to modify the logic in its `__init__` method to handle properties as well. The current logic only applies docstrings to overridden methods, so adding the ability to copy docstrings from overridden properties would be the step forward.

I have the necessary information from the `__init__` method of the `InheritDocstrings` class, and thus, I'm ready to proceed with generating the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

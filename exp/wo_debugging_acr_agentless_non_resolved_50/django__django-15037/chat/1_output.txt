To fix the issue related to `inspectdb` handling foreign keys to specific fields, I need to check the implementation of `inspectdb` functionality in Django's codebase. Specifically, I need to find where the models are created based on the database schema, which includes the handling of foreign keys. Therefore, I will need to search for the relevant source code that deals with model generation from a database.

I'm particularly interested in finding how fields, especially foreign keys, are handled and how their references are resolved during the inspection process. This could involve methods related to database introspection and schema conversion.

Thus, I will begin by searching for relevant methods, especially focusing on `inspectdb` functionality within Django's management commands. The file likely involved is `django/core/management/sql.py` or similar.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("inspectdb")
search_method_in_codebase("Field.foreign_key")
search_method_in_codebase("get_field_type")
```

To resolve the issue, I need to analyze the implementation of the `floatformat` template filter to understand how it currently handles the conversion of `Decimal` values. I will begin by searching for the `floatformat` method and the file it resides in within the Django codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("floatformat")
```

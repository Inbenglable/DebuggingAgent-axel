To address the issue of adding transaction handling to the `changelist_view` method, we will wrap the part of the method that handles POST requests with a transaction using Django's `transaction.atomic`. This ensures that any changes made during list-editable actions are rolled back in the event of an error.

Let's create the appropriate patch:

```pythony
### django/contrib/admin/options.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        # Handle POSTed bulk-edit data.
=======
        from django.db import transaction

        # Handle POSTed bulk-edit data.
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```pythony
### django/contrib/admin/options.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if request.method == "POST" and cl.list_editable and "_save" in request.POST:
=======
        if request.method == "POST" and cl.list_editable and "_save" in request.POST:
            with transaction.atomic():
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Here's the JSON format of the search/replace edits:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/admin/options.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        # Handle POSTed bulk-edit data.\n=======\n        from django.db import transaction\n\n        # Handle POSTed bulk-edit data.\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/contrib/admin/options.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if request.method == \"POST\" and cl.list_editable and \"_save\" in request.POST:\n=======\n        if request.method == \"POST\" and cl.list_editable and \"_save\" in request.POST:\n            with transaction.atomic():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

These changes ensure that any modifications made during processing of list-editable fields in the Django admin changelist view are wrapped in a transaction.

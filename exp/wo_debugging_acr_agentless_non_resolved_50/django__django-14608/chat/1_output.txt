To resolve the issue, I need to identify the code responsible for handling non-form errors in Django's FormSets. This will involve looking at how errors are managed in a FormSet, likely involving ErrorList usage.

Let's start by identifying where FormSet error handling is actually implemented. I'll search for relevant methods in the Django codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("BaseFormSet._non_form_errors")
search_class_in_codebase("BaseFormSet")
```

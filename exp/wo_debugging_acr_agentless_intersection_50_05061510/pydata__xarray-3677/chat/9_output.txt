Let's review the patch and analyze the test outputs:

### Patch Review
The patch attempts to fix the issue by modifying the `dataset_merge_method` to handle instances where the `other` argument is a `DataArray` by converting it to a temporary `Dataset`. This change appears relevant to addressing the core issue: the assumption that `other` is always a mapping, leading to the error when a `DataArray` is used.

### Test Output Analysis

#### Original Output
The original output indicates a clear failure of the `ds.merge(da)` method due to an `AttributeError`, complaining that `'DataArray' object has no attribute 'items'`.

#### Patched Output
With the patch applied, the test no longer results in the same `AttributeError`. However, it raises an `AssertionError` because the merged output does not match the expected result. This suggests that the patch has mitigated the original error but has not achieved the correct functionality for merging the `DataArray` with the `Dataset` as intended.

### Conclusion
The patch has addressed the immediate error but the functionality still fails to produce the desired outcome, as reflected in the mismatch between `actual` and `expected`.

Issue resolved: `False`

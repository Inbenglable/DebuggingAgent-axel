To address the issue described, I need to identify where the `subprocess` call, specifically in the `django.db.backends.postgres.client`, is taking place in the Django project. To do this, I'll search for the relevant method or class within the project codebase. Since there's likely an existing method handling PostgreSQL client interaction, I'll start by searching for it.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("postgresql.client")
```

This should help narrow down where in the codebase the existing logic resides, allowing me to identify the correct location for altering it to use `subprocess.run` and set the `PGPASSWORD` environment variable.

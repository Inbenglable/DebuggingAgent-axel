Based on the information retrieved, we have the following details:

1. **`display_for_field` method**: It's located in the `django/contrib/admin/utils.py` file. It currently does not handle `JSONField` specifically.

2. **`JSONField` Class**: The class we found is in the `django/db/models/fields/json.py`, and notably a different `JSONField` class is found in `django/forms/fields.py`. 

3. **`JSONField.prepare_value` method**: This is located in `django/forms/fields.py`. This method uses `json.dumps` to prepare the JSON data, ensuring valid JSON is created.

To address the issue, we need to modify the `display_for_field` method to handle `JSONField` by utilizing the `prepare_value` method. This would ensure that JSON fields are displayed as valid JSON when readonly in the Django admin interface.

We have enough information to generate the patch.

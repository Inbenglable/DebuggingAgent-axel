To address the issue with `ax.bar` raising an exception when passed all-nan data, it's crucial to investigate where and why the current behavior diverges from expectations. Based on the traceback provided, the error seems to originate from the method `Axes.bar`, specifically within the `_convert_dx` call. It's important to review the implementation details of these methods to generate an appropriate patch to handle np.nan values gracefully.

Therefore, I need to retrieve source code for the following methods and function:
- `Axes.bar` (likely in `axes/_axes.py`)
- `Axes._convert_dx` (also likely in `axes/_axes.py`)
- `matplotlib.cbook._safe_first_finite` (from `cbook/__init__.py`)

Now, let's perform the necessary code searches.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("Axes.bar")
search_method_in_codebase("Axes._convert_dx")
search_method_in_codebase("cbook._safe_first_finite")
```

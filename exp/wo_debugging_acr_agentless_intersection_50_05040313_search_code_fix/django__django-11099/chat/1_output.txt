To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code for the `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` classes in Django's `contrib.auth.validators` module. This will allow me to verify and adjust the regular expression used in these validators.

I'll search for these classes in the codebase to locate the file and retrieve their code.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ASCIIUsernameValidator")
search_class_in_codebase("UnicodeUsernameValidator")
```

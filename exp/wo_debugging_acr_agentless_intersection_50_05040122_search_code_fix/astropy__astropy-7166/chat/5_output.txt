Upon reviewing the patch, the proposed changes in the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass are intended to address the problem where property docstrings were not being inherited. Here's an analysis of the patch and test outcomes:

1. **Patch Analysis**:
    - **First Change**:
        - Expands the conditional check to also recognize properties by altering the usage of `inspect.isfunction(val)` to `(inspect.isfunction(val) or isinstance(val, property))`.
    - **Second Change**:
        - Adds logic to correctly retrieve the property getter and its docstring if `val` is a property, while maintaining the existing logic for functions.

2. **Test Outcome**:
    - **Original Output**: The test originally fails with an `AssertionError`, indicating that the property docstring is not inherited, confirming the issue described in the bug report.
    - **Patched Output**: The patch output is empty, which typically implies that the test did not trigger any assertion errors or exceptions, pointing towards successful execution and the correct inheritance of the property docstring.

Given these observations, the patch appears to correctly address the issue by extending the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass to handle property docstrings in the same way it handles method docstrings. As a result, the test passes after the patch is applied, showing that the properties inherit their docstrings properly.

**Conclusion**: The issue is resolved.

Issue resolved: `True`

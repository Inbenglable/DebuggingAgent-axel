To determine whether the issue was resolved, let's first review the provided patch and analyze the test outputs.

### Review of the Patch

**Patch Details:**

The patch modifies the `__hash__` method in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`. The previous implementation considered attributes related to the field's model, such as `self.model._meta.app_label` and `self.model._meta.model_name`, in computing the hash. The patch changes this method to rely solely on `self.creation_counter`.

By doing this, the patch aims to make the hash computation independent of the field's assignment to a model, which aligns with the issue description. The proposed change is logical since `self.creation_counter` is immutable and ensures a stable hash even after the field is assigned to a model.

### Analysis of Test Outputs

**Original Test Output:**

The error encountered was: `django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: Requested setting INSTALLED_APPS, but settings are not configured.` This error pertains to Django settings not being configured and not directly related to the hash problem. Importantly, we did see an `AssertionError`, which would be the primary indicator of hash inconsistency, being suppressed due to this configuration error.

**Patched Test Output:**

The output after applying the patch shows the same `django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured` error, indicating that the Django settings are still not configured. Again, the absence of an `AssertionError` due to the settings misconfiguration makes it impossible to confirm the resolution of the intended hash issue.

### Conclusion

The issue and test relate specifically to the hash's immutability when fields are added to a model, and without proper test execution (i.e., with configured Django settings), it is impossible to verify the presence or absence of the `AssertionError`.

**Issue resolved:** `False`

Explanation: The root Django settings problem remains unresolved in the test setup, meaning we cannot confirm if the patch resolved the hash change issue that would lead to the `AssertionError`. To definitively confirm if the hash fix resolved the issue, the test must be executed with correct configuration settings, ensuring the environment is properly set up to run Django models and tests.

The error starts when running the `collectstatic` command, which results in a traceback indicating an "Apps aren't loaded yet" exception due to the application registry not being ready. This suggests that the Django application setup may not be completed before calling the `collectstatic` command. However, this is a preliminary check, and not necessarily linked to the main issue reportedâ€”`max_post_process_passes` set to 0 causing an `UnboundLocalError`.

Considering the original issue is likely within the `ManifestStaticFilesStorage` class, and understanding that the exception traceback eventually resulted in the UnboundLocalError when max_post_process_passes was set to 0, we should focus on inspecting the `post_process` method in the storage class to locate where the `substitutions` variable is managed.

Therefore, the next method to observe is:

Observed method: `django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py:ManifestStaticFilesStorage.post_process`

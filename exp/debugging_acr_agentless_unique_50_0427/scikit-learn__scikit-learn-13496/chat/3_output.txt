The observed `IsolationForest.__init__` method does not currently expose the `warm_start` parameter. The issue arises when the user tries to set `warm_start` via `set_params`, which fails because `warm_start` is not part of the valid parameter list for `IsolationForest`.

Since the superclass `BaseBagging` already supports `warm_start`, the solution is to explicitly include it in the `IsolationForest` constructor parameters.

Before confirming the buggy method or code, I will observe how parameters are passed to the parent class and if there might be any other influential parameters involved in the `super().__init__()` call.

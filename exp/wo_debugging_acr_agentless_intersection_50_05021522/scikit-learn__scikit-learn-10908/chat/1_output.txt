To resolve this issue, I need to examine the `CountVectorizer` class and its `get_feature_names` method in the scikit-learn codebase to understand its current behavior when vocabulary is provided. I'll start by searching for the `get_feature_names` method within the file where the `CountVectorizer` class is implemented to see its implementation details.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("CountVectorizer.get_feature_names_out")
search_method_in_codebase("CountVectorizer.get_feature_names")
search_class_in_codebase("CountVectorizer")
```

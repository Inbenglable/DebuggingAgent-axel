**Reviewing the Patch and Test Outputs:**

1. **Original and Patched Output:**

   - **Original Output:** 
     - The test failed with an `AttributeError`: `module 'django.db.migrations' has no attribute 'OneToOneField'`.
     - This error indicates that `migrations.OneToOneField` should be `models.OneToOneField` as `OneToOneField` belongs to `django.db.models`, not `django.db.migrations`.

   - **Patched Output:**
     - The same `AttributeError` persists, indicating the root of the failure remains unaddressed by the patch.

2. **Patch Analysis:**

   - **Patch Intent:**
     - The patch aims to modify the `add_field` method in `SQLiteSchemaEditor` to ensure that the table is remade correctly when adding a nullable `OneToOneField` by including these fields in the condition that triggers the `_remake_table` process.

   - **Patch Limitation:**
     - While the patch's proposed change to trigger `_remake_table` for nullable `OneToOneField` additions appears appropriate, the test environment was not working correctly due to a wrong import (`migrations.OneToOneField` instead of `models.OneToOneField`), which was unrelated to the database alteration process itself.

3. **Conclusion:**

   - The core issue with the test code regarding the incorrect import of `OneToOneField` remains unresolved in both original and patched states, thus preventing a proper evaluation of the patch's effect on the database operation.
   - Consequently, the test setup is faulty, and the current output cannot reliably confirm whether the patch addresses the database error because it's halted by an unrelated import error.

Given the unaltered test failure due to an import error and the inability to evaluate the patch's database impact, the issue effectively remains unresolved:

Issue resolved: `False`

To resolve the issue, I need to update the `django.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments` method to determine if the `-m` flag was used during Python launch differently. 

Before generating the patch, I need to retrieve the source code of the `get_child_arguments` method to understand its existing implementation and then I can modify it as per the instructions given in the issue description.

Since the file path isn't provided, I'll search for the method in the codebase first:

```python
search_method_in_codebase("get_child_arguments")
```

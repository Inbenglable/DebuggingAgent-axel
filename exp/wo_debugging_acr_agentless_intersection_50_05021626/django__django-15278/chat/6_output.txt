I have gathered the relevant information about the methods and classes involved, particularly the `add_field` and `_remake_table` methods within the `SQLiteSchemaEditor`. With this information, I am ready to generate a patch to handle adding a nullable `OneToOneField` with a unique constraint in SQLite.

Ready generation: `True`

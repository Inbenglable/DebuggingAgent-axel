The issue is occurring within the `timesince` function in the `django/utils/timesince.py` file. The error arises due to attempting to subtract an offset-naive datetime from an offset-aware datetime, which results in a `TypeError`. This happens at the point where the `remaining_time` is calculated using `(now - pivot).total_seconds()`.

The test demonstrates that when `USE_TZ` is set to True, the `now` variable is timezone-aware, because it's obtained using `timezone.now()`. However, the `pivot` datetime is naive, as tzinfo is not passed when instanciating it, resulting in the observed error.

To find the buggy line, trace through the code where `pivot` is being created and ensure that it properly considers the timezone information when `d` is timezone-aware.

Buggy method: `django/utils/timesince.py:timesince`

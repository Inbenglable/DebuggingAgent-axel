To resolve this issue, I need to retrieve the source code of the `Paginator` class to add the `__iter__` method as proposed. 

I'll proceed to retrieve the source code for the `Paginator` class in the `django/core/paginator.py` file.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/core/paginator.py", "Paginator")
```

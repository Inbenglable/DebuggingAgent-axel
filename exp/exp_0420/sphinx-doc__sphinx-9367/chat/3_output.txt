To diagnose the observed behavior, we first look into how the `sphinx.pycode.ast.unparse` function deals with single-element tuples, such as `(1,)`. The expected behavior is for the function to retain the trailing comma during unparsing, but the output is removing the comma, rendering it `(1)` instead.

From the test output provided, the `unparse` function is called, and within it, the `visit` method from the `_UnparseVisitor` class gets executed. This visitor pattern is typically responsible for converting an AST node back to source code. For some reason, this implementation incorrectly handles the single-element tuple case.

Since the abnormal behavior occurs within the `unparse` method, particularly its handling of the `ast.Tuple` node, our next step is to directly inspect the `_UnparseVisitor` class to understand how it processes tuple nodes.

Observed method: `sphinx/pycode/ast.py:_UnparseVisitor.visit_Tuple`

To address the issue, I need to examine the `get_feature_names` method within the `CountVectorizer` class. This will help me understand how it currently handles the vocabulary and the exception it raises. I will use the search API to retrieve the relevant source code.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("CountVectorizer.get_feature_names")
```

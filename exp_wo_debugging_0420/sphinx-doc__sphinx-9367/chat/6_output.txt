To resolve the issue, we need to specifically modify the `visit_Tuple` method in the `_UnparseVisitor` class to correctly handle the rendering of 1-element tuples. At this point, I have not retrieved the exact code for this method. 

Given the context, next step involves retrieving the source code for `visit_Tuple` method to understand its current implementation and then modify it accordingly.

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/pycode/ast.py", "_UnparseVisitor.visit_Tuple")
```

Based on the analysis of the API output, I need to determine which of the code snippets are relevant for our investigation. We're focusing on how `_identifiers` are used in relation to the `identify_format` function and how the error arises when `is_fits` is called. Here's my evaluation:

1. **astropy/cosmology/io/tests/base.py:49-55**:
   - This references the usage of `_identifiers` within a different context related to cosmology, which is not directly related to the current issue.
   - **Not needed**.

2. **astropy/io/registry/base.py:310-316**:
   - This snippet is directly involved in the logic of `identify_format`. It iterates over `_identifiers`, checking and calling relevant functions.
   - **Needed**.

3. **astropy/io/registry/compat.py:24-30**:
   - This snippet provides context on the backward compatibility for `_identifiers`. It indicates the global default registry where `_identifiers` are defined and used.
   - **Needed**.

4. **astropy/io/registry/__init__.py:6-12**:
   - Similar to the above context in terms of backward compatibility but focusing on import statements that may not directly explain the error.
   - **Not needed**.

5. **astropy/io/registry/core.py:65-71**:
   - Includes initialization logic that might set `_identifiers`. This provides insight into the structure and setup, making it slightly relevant.
   - **Needed**.

6. **astropy/io/registry/tests/test_registries.py:832-838**:
   - This snippet tests registry updates and errors but doesn't seem directly connected to our current investigation of "IndexError".
   - **Not needed**.

Based on the above analysis, the relevant code snippets are:
```
astropy/io/registry/base.py:310-316
astropy/io/registry/compat.py:24-30
astropy/io/registry/core.py:65-71
```

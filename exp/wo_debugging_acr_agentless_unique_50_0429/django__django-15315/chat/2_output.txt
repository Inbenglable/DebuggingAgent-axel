Analyzing the returned contents:

1. **django/db/models/fields/__init__.py:Field**
   - This file contains the `Field` class definition used within Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system, which includes the method `__hash__`. This is highly relevant to the issue.

2. **django/forms/fields.py:Field**
   - This file contains another `Field` class, but it seems related to forms rather than the ORM system. While interesting, it does not appear directly relevant to the hashing behavior of fields assigned to models.

3. **django/contrib/gis/gdal/field.py:Field**
   - This file appears to define a `Field` class related to GIS (Geographic Information Systems). It is not related to ORM fields and therefore not relevant to the issue at hand.

Based on the analysis, the relevant file is:

```
django/db/models/fields/__init__.py:Field
```

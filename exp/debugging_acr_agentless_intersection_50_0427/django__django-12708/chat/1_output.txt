Analyzing the provided runtime information, we found that the error occurs when executing the `migrate` command for the `test_app` with the specific migration `0002_remove_index_together.py`. The observed error message is: 

```
ValueError: Found wrong number (2) of constraints for test_app_testmodel(field1, field2)
```

This error happens at the line in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` during the `_delete_composed_index` method call. When we attempt to delete an index together, Django's backend schema logic expects to find exactly one constraint associated with the index. However, due to the presence of both `unique_together` and `index_together` on the same fields, there are two constraints, leading to the observed crash.

Given the migration logic, the error arises in managing model constraints during the schema alteration process.

To deeply trace the problem, the next appropriate step is to observe the `_delete_composed_index` method in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`.

Observed method: `django/db/backends/base/schema.py:_delete_composed_index`

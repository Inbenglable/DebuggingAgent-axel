The issue arises because SQL reserved keywords used as table names are not being quoted in the SQL statements, leading to syntax errors. The `check_constraints` function in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py` constructs SQL queries where table names should be quoted to avoid such issues.

From the code snippet retrieved for the `check_constraints` method, I can see that table names are interpolated directly into SQL strings. The solution is to ensure that these table names are correctly quoted using backticks (`) or the appropriate quoting method provided by Django, which would likely involve using `self.ops.quote_name()` for quoting.

Since I have the full implementation of the `check_constraints` function, it's sufficient to proceed with making the necessary changes.

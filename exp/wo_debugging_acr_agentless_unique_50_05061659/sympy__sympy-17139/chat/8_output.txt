To resolve the issue of invalid comparison of complex numbers within the `_TR56` method in the `sympy/simplify/fu.py` file, we need to safely handle the comparison when `rv.exp` could be a complex number by ensuring that we only proceed with the comparison if `rv.exp` is a real number.

Here's the patch in the **SEARCH/REPLACE** format:

```pythony
### sympy/simplify/fu.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if (rv.exp < 0) == True:
=======
        if rv.exp.is_number and (rv.exp < 0) == True:
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```pythony
### sympy/simplify/fu.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if (rv.exp > max) == True:
=======
        if rv.exp.is_number and (rv.exp > max) == True:
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now we'll provide the edit result in JSON format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/simplify/fu.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if (rv.exp < 0) == True:\n=======\n        if rv.exp.is_number and (rv.exp < 0) == True:\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### sympy/simplify/fu.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if (rv.exp > max) == True:\n=======\n        if rv.exp.is_number and (rv.exp > max) == True:\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

With these changes, the code will only attempt to compare the exponent `rv.exp` when it is confirmed to be a real number, thus avoiding the issue with invalid complex number comparisons. Make sure to test the patch thoroughly to confirm that functionality is preserved and the issue is resolved.

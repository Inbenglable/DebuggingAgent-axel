To implement the solution, we need to:

1. Add `set_antialiased` and `get_antialiased` methods to the `Text` class in `lib/matplotlib/text.py`.
2. Adjust `RendererAgg.draw_text` in `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_agg.py` to use the per-object antialiasing property.

Currently, I need to review the `Text` class and the `RendererAgg.draw_text` method to ensure I have the complete context required for both implementing a new attribute in `Text` and modifying how `draw_text` obtains its antialiasing setting.

Let's retrieve the source code for these components:

```python
search_class_in_file("lib/matplotlib/text.py", "Text")
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_agg.py", "RendererAgg.draw_text")
```

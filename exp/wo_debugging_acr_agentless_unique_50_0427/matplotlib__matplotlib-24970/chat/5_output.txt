To resolve the deprecation warnings, I will need some context of where `xa`, `self._i_over`, `self._i_under`, and `self._i_bad` are initialized, as well as the function or class they belong to. To do this, I'll search for the surrounding method or class within `colors.py` file.

```python
search_code_in_file("lib/matplotlib/colors.py", "class")
search_code_in_file("lib/matplotlib/colors.py", "def")
```

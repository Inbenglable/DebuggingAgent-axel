To determine whether the issue is resolved, let's closely review the patch and compare both the original and patched outputs of the test.

### Patch Review

1. **Modification of `_wrap_in_pandas_container`:**

   - The patch introduces an additional parameter `original_input_dtypes` to the `_wrap_in_pandas_container` function.
   - It includes logic in the function to preserve the original dtypes by using `astype` on the relevant columns of the DataFrame created within the function.

2. **Passing Dtypes:**

   - When calling `_wrap_in_pandas_container`, the patch ensures that `original_input_dtypes` is populated with the dtypes of the original input DataFrame.

### Test Output Analysis

- **Original Output:**

  Before applying the patch, the test resulted in an `AssertionError`, indicating that the DataFrame output did not preserve the original dtypes (`np.float16` and `category`).

- **Patched Output:**

  After applying the patch, the test output confirms that all dtypes are preserved, suggesting that the `AssertionError` is no longer raised.

### Conclusion

Based on the patch review, the changes introduced seem to successfully address the issue by preserving the dtypes of the input DataFrame when using transformers such as `SelectKBest` with pandas output. Furthermore, the patched test output indicates that the problem has been resolved, as the expected dtypes are now matched.

Issue resolved: `True`

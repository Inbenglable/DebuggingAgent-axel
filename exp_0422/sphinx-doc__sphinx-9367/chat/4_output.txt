The issue at hand involves the incorrect rendering of a single-element tuple when parsed and then unparsed using the `unparse` method. The current `unparse` method calls an internal class `_UnparseVisitor` which likely deals with the conversion from AST back to code.

The problem lies in the `unparse` method not preserving the comma in a 1-element tuple. This suggests the `_UnparseVisitor` implementation might not handle the edge case of single-element tuples correctly.

To identify the root cause, we need to inspect how `_UnparseVisitor` processes tuples, particularly single-element ones. The exploration should focus on this visitor class to understand how it handles different AST node types, especially `Tuple` nodes.

Given this, I will proceed to analyze the relevant part of the code by examining the implementation details of `_UnparseVisitor`.

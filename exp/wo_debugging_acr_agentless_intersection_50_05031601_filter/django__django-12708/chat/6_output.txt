To determine if the issue is resolved, let's review the patch and compare the test outputs before and after applying the patch:

### Patch Review

The patch modifies `schema.py` to:

1. **Change the condition to check constraint numbers**:
   - **Before**: The code expected exactly one constraint.
   - **After**: The code now allows either one or two constraints (`unique_together` and `index_together`), which resolves the ValueError.

2. **Improved Error Message**:
   - Provides more context in the error message by including how many constraints were found.

### Analysis of Test Outputs

- **Original Output**: 
   - The migration failed with a `ValueError` due to encountering two constraints (`unique_together` and `index_together`) whereas it was expecting one.

- **Patched Output**: 
  - The migration succeeds with no errors. The operation to remove `index_together` is completed successfully, indicating that the patch allows for coexistence of `unique_together` and `index_together` during such operations.

### Conclusion

The patch correctly addresses the issue by making the process more tolerant of having both the `unique_together` and `index_together` constraints simultaneously, thereby preventing the `ValueError` from occurring during the migration.

Issue resolved: `True`

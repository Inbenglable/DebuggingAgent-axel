To determine whether the issue is resolved, we need to review the patch and the output before and after applying it.

### Patch Analysis:
The patch updates the method `create_method` in `django/db/models/manager.py` from manually assigning `__name__` and `__doc__` to using `functools.wraps`. This change is designed to preserve the complete function metadata, including the correct function signature, which should address the reported issue of `inspect.signature` returning incorrect signature information.

### Test Output Analysis:
1. **Original Output Before Patch:**
   - The output shows a `django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured` error related to Django settings not being configured correctly. This error occurs before any checks on the signature of `bulk_create`.

2. **Output After Patch:**
   - The output remains unchanged, showing the same `django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured` error, implying that the error regarding settings configuration prevents the test from checking if the patch actually resolves the issue with `inspect.signature`.

### Conclusion:
Since the same configuration error occurs both before and after the patch, the test does not run properly to verify if the patch fixes the signature issue. As a result, based on these outputs alone, we cannot conclude that the issue is resolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

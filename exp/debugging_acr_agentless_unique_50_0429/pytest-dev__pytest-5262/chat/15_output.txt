The `__getattr__` method in the `EncodedFile` class has been retrieved and analyzed. The method forwards attribute access to the underlying `buffer` object, which includes incorrectly relaying file modes.

### Analysis
To fix the issue:

- We need to modify this behavior by defining an explicit mode management that omits the binary indicator (`'b'`) for the `EncodedFile` class.
- An explicit check and adjustment can be added for the `mode` attribute within this method to ensure it aligns with expected behavior (i.e., text mode).
  
Given that I have gathered necessary information and analyzed the root cause properly, I am ready to proceed with generating a patch.

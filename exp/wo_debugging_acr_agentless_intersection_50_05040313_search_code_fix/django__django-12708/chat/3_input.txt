## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Migration crashes deleting an index_together if there is a unique_together on the same fields
Description
	
Happens with Django 1.11.10
Steps to reproduce:
1) Create models with 2 fields, add 2 same fields to unique_together and to index_together
2) Delete index_together -> Fail
It will fail at django/db/backends/base/schema.py, line 378, in _delete_composed_index(), ValueError: Found wrong number (2) of constraints for as this one will find two constraints, the _uniq and the _idx one. No way to get out of this...
The worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the "new" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.
I think there are 2 different points here:
1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together
2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To address this issue, I need to retrieve the source code for the method `_delete_composed_index` mentioned in the error trace. This method is likely responsible for handling the deletion of indexes, and understanding its current logic will help determine how to address the problem with distinguishing between index constraints and unique constraints. 

I will search for this method in the relevant Django file described in the issue. 

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "_delete_composed_index")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "_delete_composed_index")
RESULT:
#### django/db/backends/base/schema.py:BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor._delete_composed_index
```python
    def _delete_composed_index(self, model, fields, constraint_kwargs, sql):
        meta_constraint_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.constraints}
        meta_index_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.indexes}
        columns = [model._meta.get_field(field).column for field in fields]
        constraint_names = self._constraint_names(
            model, columns, exclude=meta_constraint_names | meta_index_names,
            **constraint_kwargs
        )
        if len(constraint_names) != 1:
            raise ValueError("Found wrong number (%s) of constraints for %s(%s)" % (
                len(constraint_names),
                model._meta.db_table,
                ", ".join(columns),
            ))
        self.execute(self._delete_constraint_sql(sql, model, constraint_names[0]))

```


==================================================

Your Output:
Based on the information retrieved, the issue with the `_delete_composed_index` method involves incorrect handling when both `unique_together` and `index_together` are on the same fields. To address this, the logic should differentiate between unique constraints and index constraints, ensuring it correctly processes the constraints intended for deletion.

The code for `_delete_composed_index` has been obtained, and it appears that the issue arises because it expects only one constraint to match the given criteria. However, with both a unique constraint and an index constraint on the same fields, multiple constraints are found which causes the problem.

To proceed with generating the patch, I need to ensure if there's any necessity to understand how constraints or indexes are defined or manipulated elsewhere in the codebase that might influence this method's behavior. But, given the information and the method's source code already retrieved, I believe I can proceed to generating the patch. Therefore, I will indicate readiness to generate the patch.

```plaintext
Ready generation: True
```
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

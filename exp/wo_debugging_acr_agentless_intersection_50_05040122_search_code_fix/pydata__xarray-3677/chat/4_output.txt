Here is the patch to resolve the issue:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### xarray/core/dataset.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        merge_result = dataset_merge_method(\n=======\n        if isinstance(other, xr.DataArray):\n            other = other.to_dataset()\n        merge_result = dataset_merge_method(\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch modifies the `Dataset.merge` method to convert a `DataArray` to a `Dataset` using the existing `to_dataset` method before attempting the merge, thereby resolving the issue of the method failing when a `DataArray` is passed.

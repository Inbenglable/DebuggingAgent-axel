## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Meta.ordering fields must not be included in GROUP BY clause
Description
	
This continues (closed) [1] ticket.
I beleave it was not properly fixed in commit [0ddb4ebf].
While commit [0ddb4ebf] removes ORDER BY when Meta.ordering is used it still does populates GROUP BY with Meta.ordering fields thus leads to wrong aggregation.
PR with test case was added at [2].

</ISSUE>


In the previous round, you called search APIs to retrieve relevant source code that would help identify the root cause of the issue and generate a patch. However, the code you retrieved appears in multiple locations (maybe some are irrelevant but have same key). So now your task is to determine which of the retrieved contents are indeed you need, and filter out the irrelevant ones.
This is your API invocation round output:
To address the issue described, I need to inspect the relevant code handling the ordering and grouping behavior in Django queries. This typically involves the QuerySet and SQL compiler modules. Since I need to inspect how the Meta.ordering fields are included in the GROUP BY clause, it's essential to examine the parts of the codebase responsible for query compilation. Specifically, I'll look at how Django processes ordering fields in QuerySets and compiles SQL statements.

I'll start by searching for classes and methods related to compiling SQL queries because they would include the logic where ordering might unintentionally affect GROUP BY clauses.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("compile")
search_class_in_codebase("SQLCompiler")
search_method_in_codebase("get_ordering")
```

And this is the corresponding API returned result (each content is started with #### FILE_PATH:NAME):
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("compile")
RESULT:
#### tests/queries/tests.py:WhereNodeTest.MockCompiler.compile
```python
        def compile(self, node):
            return node.as_sql(self, connection)

```

#### django/db/models/expressions.py:DurationExpression.compile
```python
    def compile(self, side, compiler, connection):
        try:
            output = side.output_field
        except FieldError:
            pass
        else:
            if output.get_internal_type() == 'DurationField':
                sql, params = compiler.compile(side)
                return connection.ops.format_for_duration_arithmetic(sql), params
        return compiler.compile(side)

```

#### django/db/models/sql/compiler.py:SQLCompiler.compile
```python
    def compile(self, node):
        vendor_impl = getattr(node, 'as_' + self.connection.vendor, None)
        if vendor_impl:
            sql, params = vendor_impl(self, self.connection)
        else:
            sql, params = node.as_sql(self, self.connection)
        return sql, params

```



Among the API returned contents, there may be some irrelevant ones or not. So now you need to analyze each returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.
Now, please first analyze the API returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.

Then you need to choose you needed ones with the following format:
```
FILE_PATH_1:NAME_1
FILE_PATH_2:NAME_2
...
```

Note:
1. The value of FILE_PATH:NAME, must consistent with the API returned content (but remove the prefix ####).
2. You may select one or more contents, or even all of them if they are indeed you need.

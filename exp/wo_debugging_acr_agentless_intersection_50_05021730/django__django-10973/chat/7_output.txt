To make the necessary patch, I need to retrieve the source code for the `runshell_db` and `runshell` methods in the `DatabaseClient` class, which is defined in the `django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py` file. This will allow me to understand how the PostgreSQL client currently operates and implement the intended changes using `subprocess.run` and setting the `PGPASSWORD` environment variable.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py", "DatabaseClient.runshell_db")
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py", "DatabaseClient.runshell")
search_class_in_file("django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py", "DatabaseClient")
```

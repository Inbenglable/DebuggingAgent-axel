To address the issue of preventing the "None" string from being sent as a header value, we can improve the functionality of the `merge_setting` function to ensure that when headers are merged, any headers with `None` values in the session's defaults will be removed correctly. This ensures consistency with the expectations set in the documentation.

Based on the investigations, itâ€™s clear that the function already handles `None` values correctly when merging. Therefore, further manipulation specifically for headers isn't actually needed given how the current merge is structured. However, we might double-check the invocation to ensure it's applied on headers specifically.

Here's the patch to reinforce this header behavior in the implementation:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### requests/sessions.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nheaders=merge_setting(request.headers, self.headers, dict_class=CaseInsensitiveDict),\n=======\nheaders={k: v for k, v in merge_setting(request.headers, self.headers, dict_class=CaseInsensitiveDict).items() if v is not None},\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This replacement ensures that only headers with actual values (non-`None`) are included in the final headers dictionary used by `prepare_request`. This effectively consolidates the intention that setting a header to `None` should omit it entirely from being sent.

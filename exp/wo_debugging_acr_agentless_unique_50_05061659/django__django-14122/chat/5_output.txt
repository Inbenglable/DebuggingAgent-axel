Based on the issue description, we need to address how `Meta.ordering` fields are incorrectly included in the `GROUP BY` clause by examining the methods related to query compilation within the `SQLCompiler` class. Specifically, the `get_group_by` method appears relevant for addressing the issue of inappropriate fields being included in the `GROUP BY` clause. We need to retrieve the source code for this method to understand how it's constructed and identify where corrections should be made.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/sql/compiler.py", "SQLCompiler.get_group_by")
```

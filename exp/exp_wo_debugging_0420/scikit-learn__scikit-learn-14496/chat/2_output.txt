To resolve the issue, I need to check the method where the bug is occurring. The issue appears to be in the `OPTICS` class, specifically around the lines where `min_samples` is processed and eventually used. The `fit` method is mentioned as the context where the error is raised, but the description references lines around 439 and 440 for the instantiation or usage, which suggests the bug likely resides in the `compute_optics_graph` method. 

Next, I need to look at both the `fit` and `compute_optics_graph` method within the `optics_.py` file. Let's retrieve the relevant methods to ensure the issue's correct context and location.
```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/cluster/optics_.py", "OPTICS.fit")
search_method_in_file("sklearn/cluster/optics_.py", "compute_optics_graph")
```

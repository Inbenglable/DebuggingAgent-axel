To resolve the issue, I need to ensure the `call_command` method can correctly handle arguments that are part of a mutually exclusive group. Since I already have the `call_command` source code, I need to analyze and possibly modify the logic to handle mutually exclusive groups properly when passed via keyword arguments. 

Next, I need to check how the argument parsing, especially for mutually exclusive groups, is handled. Since mutually exclusive groups are typically handled by `argparse`, I should check if there are specific actions or logic related to it in the relevant code sections.

However, I already have gathered enough information from the initial analysis and source code examination. Therefore, I am ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

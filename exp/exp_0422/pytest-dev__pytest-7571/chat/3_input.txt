You need to trace the abnormal program to resolve project issues and submit pull requests.
Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **pytest** project:
#### ISSUE
caplog fixture doesn't restore log level after test
From the documentation at https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.0.0/logging.html#caplog-fixture, "The log levels set are restored automatically at the end of the test".
It used to work, but looks broken in new 6.0 release. Minimal example to reproduce:

```
def test_foo(caplog):
    caplog.set_level(42)

def test_bar(caplog):
    print(caplog.handler.level)
```

It prints "0" for pytest<6, "42" after.


Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
import pytest

def test_foo(caplog):
    original_level = caplog.handler.level
    print(f"[test_foo] Initial handler level: {original_level}")
    caplog.set_level(42)
    modified_level = caplog.handler.level
    print(f"[test_foo] Handler level after set_level: {modified_level}")
    assert modified_level == 42

def test_bar(caplog):
    restored_level = caplog.handler.level
    print(f"[test_bar] Handler level in next test: {restored_level}")
    assert restored_level == logging.NOTSET  # Assuming NOTSET as the default level

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pytest.main([__file__, "-v"])


This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
The provided test script consists of two tests: `test_foo` and `test_bar`. The issue arises because `caplog.set_level(42)` modifies the log handler's level to 42 in `test_foo`. The expectation, as per the documentation, is that the log level should automatically reset to its original level after `test_foo` completes. However, in `test_bar`, the log level is not reset; it remains 42, leading to a test failure due to the expectation that it should be the default level (`logging.NOTSET`).

The error `NameError: name 'logging' is not defined` in the traceback indicates a missing import statement, which needs to be addressed for the assertion to check the log level against `logging.NOTSET`. However, this is secondary to the main functional issue, which is the log level not being reset correctly between tests.

The primary task is to identify where in the pytest codebase the caplog fixture should be restoring the log levels, and why it's failing to do so. The abnormal behavior can be traced to the mechanism responsible for resetting the log level in the caplog fixture.

Next, we will trace the `caplog` fixture's behavior to understand why the log level is not being restored between tests.

Observed method: `src/_pytest/logging.py:LogCaptureFixture.handler`
==================================================


Now you choose downstream method LogCaptureFixture.handler to further observe, tracing the abnormal program behavior.
This is the method code:
   361	    def handler(self) -> LogCaptureHandler:
   362	        """
   363	        :rtype: LogCaptureHandler
   364	        """
   365	        return self._item._store[caplog_handler_key]


This is the runtime information of LogCaptureFixture.handler:

Traceback (most recent call last):

You need to trace the abnormal program behavior step by step to identify the root cause of the bug and locate the buggy method that contains the code to be fixed.
Now, please first analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior. 

Then, if you can already locate the buggy method and buggy code, reply with:  
Buggy method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Otherwise, continue tracing by telling me the code line scope that you want to deeper observe, we will show you the deeper downstream run-time information of the scope you select. Please reply with:
Observed scope: `{FILE_PATH}:{START_LOC}-{END_LOC}`
Note that {FILE_PATH} refers to the path relative to the repository.

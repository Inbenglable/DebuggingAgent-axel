Analyzing the runtime information for the `kahane_simplify()` function provides insight into how gamma matrices are handled and simplified. The `kahane_simplify()` function takes a tensor product of gamma matrices and simplifies them using contraction identities.

The abnormal behavior arises during the handling of leading gamma matrices that are not contracted. The issue reported involves reversing the order of such leading uncontracted gamma matrices.

In the provided runtime trace, it appears that the interaction with `links` and `cum_sign_list` results in incorrect handling for uncontracted leading gamma matrices in some cases. The key sections that might contribute to this problem are those manipulating `links`, `cum_sign_list`, `resulting_indices`, and `prepend_indices`.

After reviewing the logic of `kahane_simplify()` and its iterative process to manage free and contracted indices, it seems the bug is related to how `prepend_indices` and `resulting_indices` are computed and inserted back into the final product.

Therefore, the method to focus on is:

Based on the provided information, the test output, both before and after applying the patch, remains the same. It shows an error message indicating that the Django applications aren't loaded yet: `django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet.`

This error in the test output is related to the Django app configuration, and it's not the intended error or issue originally reported about the aggregation being broken by `order_by('?')`. Therefore, the error about the apps not being ready must be addressed separately from the aggregation issue.

In terms of the patch itself, it appears to be correctly targeting the root of the reported issue by preventing `Random` expressions from influencing the `GROUP BY` clause. However, the test script wasn't able to execute successfully due to the `AppRegistryNotReady` error, thus we cannot confirm whether applying the patch actually resolves the original aggregation issue due to the blockage in testing.

Since the provided test output doesn't demonstrate the resolution of the reported issue regarding aggregation with `order_by('?')`, I cannot conclusively state that the patch resolves the original problem.

Issue resolved: `False`

Based on the provided patch context and test outputs, the following observations can be made:

1. **Patch Review**:
   - The patch properly addresses the issue within the `check_constraints` method by adding backticks around table names in SQL statements. This approach should correctly handle table names that are SQL reserved words such as "order".

2. **Test Output Analysis**:
   - Before applying the patch, the test output shows a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module named 'test_app', indicating that the test setup is incomplete or the module is not defined correctly.
   - After applying the patch, the same `ModuleNotFoundError` persists. This suggests that the test setup is not correctly configured, and as result, the patch's effectiveness is not properly validated because the setup does not reach the stage where the patch changes could be tested.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The patch itself appears to be correct with respect to handling SQL reserved words in table names.
   - However, due to the test setup failure (missing 'test_app' module), we cannot determine if the issue regarding SQL reserved words crashing `loaddata` is resolved based on the provided test outputs.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I must conclude:

Issue resolved: `False`

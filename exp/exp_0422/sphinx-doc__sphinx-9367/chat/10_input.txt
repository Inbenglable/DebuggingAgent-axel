#### ISSUE
1-element tuple rendered incorrectly
**Describe the bug**
This is a followup to #7964 which has been addressed in #8265.

However the special case of a 1-element tuple is still not handled correctly.

`(1,)` is rendered as `(1)`, but should keep the trailing comma.

**To Reproduce**
Add a testcase
```
    ("(1,)", "(1,)"),                           # Tuple (single element)
```

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
To analyze the abnormal program behavior, we have established that:

1. The input `"(1,)"` is the source code for a single-element tuple.
2. The output after parsing and unparsing is `"(1)"`, which is incorrect because the comma was removed.
3. The expected output is `"(1,)"`, retaining the comma to denote a single-element tuple.

The discrepancy arises during the unparsing process executed by the `ast.unparse` method.

Given this information, the issue appears to be related to how single-element tuples are handled in the unparser logic. During the parsing process, the input is correctly recognized as an AST for a tuple with one element, but the unparsing is not maintaining the comma in the output string.

Proceeding with the analysis, the next step would be to trace into the `unparse` function as it's responsible for transforming the AST back to string representation.

Observed method: `sphinx/pycode/ast.py:unparse`
==================================================
### Analysis of Current Observed Code and Abnormal Program Behavior

#### Key Observations:
1. The main issue is that the unparsing process for a single-element tuple `(1,)` fails to retain the trailing comma, resulting in the incorrect output `(1)` when using the `unparse` method.
2. The `unparse` method:
   - Receives an `ast.AST` node and attempts to convert it back into a string representation.
   - Delegates the actual unparsing logic to the `_UnparseVisitor` via its `visit` method.

#### Observed Traceback:
- There is an unrelated runtime error (`AssertionError`) caused by the `dbgsnooper` tool, which doesn't affect the identification of the bug but raises concerns about test setup issues. This will need to be addressed separately if we plan to test the fix.

#### Analysis of the `unparse` Method:
- The `unparse` method itself acts as a dispatcher and doesn't directly contain the logic to handle tuples.
- The true unparse logic resides in the `_UnparseVisitor` class, invoked via the `visit` method.

### Next Step
Since the incorrect transformation happens during unparsing, we should further inspect the `_UnparseVisitor` implementation. This will help determine exactly how single-element tuples are being mishandled during the unparsing process.

#### Action:
To locate the issue, let's trace deeper into `_UnparseVisitor` methods responsible for unparsing tuple nodes. Specifically, we need to analyze methods related to handling tuples.

### Request
Observed scope: `sphinx/pycode/ast.py:82-120`

This range encompasses the likely implementation of `_UnparseVisitor`, which should include the relevant logic for unparsing tuples.
==================================================
### Analysis of Current Observed Code and Abnormal Program Behavior

#### Key Observations:
- The observed code snippet introduces the `_UnparseVisitor` class, which inherits from `ast.NodeVisitor` and encompasses logic relevant to unparsing AST nodes.
- The snippet provides initial auxiliary method definitions like `_visit_op`, `visit_arg`, `_visit_arg_with_default`, and `visit_arguments`, setting up the context for later implementations that will entail unparsing functionalities.
- The runtime error observed (`AssertionError`) seems to result from a testing setup issue and is unrelated to the unparsing logic being addressed.

#### Analysis and Next Steps:
The test failure indication does not prevent proceeding with the pinpointing of the logic responsible for handling tuples within the `_UnparseVisitor`. The next logical step would be to investigate methods in this class that are directly responsible for processing tuple nodes. Specifically, these methods should deal with parsing and returning string representations of tuples. 

Proceeding with further tracing should help identify how the `comma` is being inadvertently dropped during the tuple unparsing routine.


### Request
Let's continue by narrowing down to the specific method handling tuple nodes.

#### Action:
- Examine the method(s) in `_UnparseVisitor` responsible for tuples.

### Next Step
Observed method: `sphinx/pycode/ast.py:_UnparseVisitor.visit_Tuple` (hypothesizing the typical method name that handles tuple nodes)
==================================================
### Analysis of Current Observed Code and Abnormal Program Behavior

#### Key Observations:
- The `visit_Tuple` method in the `_UnparseVisitor` class is responsible for unparsing tuple nodes from AST back to a string representation.
- The method constructs the string by joining the elements of the tuple with a comma and enclosing them in parentheses.
- For single-element tuples, the trailing comma is being omitted because of how the elements are joined and handled.

#### Reason for Incorrect Output:
- The line `return "(" + ", ".join(self.visit(e) for e in node.elts) + ")"` does not specifically handle the case where there is only a single element in the tuple.
- When there's only one element, the `join` method doesn't append a comma after the element, which leads to the incorrect output.

### Conclusion
The issue arises not from parsing but specifically during unparsing in the `visit_Tuple` method. The omission of the trailing comma for single-element tuples is due to the straightforward joining logic, which doesn't account for single-element tuples needing special handling.

### Bug Localization
The buggy logic resides in how the tuple elements are joined within `visit_Tuple`.

### Buggy Method Identification
The buggy method according to the analysis is:

Buggy method: `sphinx/pycode/ast.py:_UnparseVisitor.visit_Tuple`
==================================================


Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

### IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

### IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

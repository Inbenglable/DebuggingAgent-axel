To address the issue, I first need to find the source code of the `execute_sql_flush` method. I also need to analyze the usage of `self.connection.alias` within the relevant class context to ensure that the method can infer the `using` argument properly. Since the method likely belongs to a class dealing with database operations, I'll search for `DatabaseOperations.execute_sql_flush` in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("DatabaseOperations.execute_sql_flush")
```

The error message indicates that there is an "ImproperlyConfigured" exception occurring because the Django settings were not fully configured before accessing them. This is happening specifically when trying to create a new Django model class (`Person`) due to the interaction with the `apps.get_containing_app_config(module)` line.

Let's break down the situation based on the traceback:

- The setup is supposed to be configuring Django settings for testing, which is done in the `setup_django` function. This function calls `settings.configure()` with the required settings.

- The error occurs during the execution of `class Person(models.Model):`, when Django is trying to access the Django application registry with `apps.get_containing_app_config(module)` in the `ModelBase.__new__` method. This suggests that the settings have not been properly configured by this point in time.

The issue may arise from the order of operations within the script or an oversight in how/when `setup_django()` is being called or configured.

Since this is the primary issue causing the script not to run, I need to check further into the `setup_django` function to verify if `settings.configure` is being called correctly and if the settings are appropriate.

Observed method: `reproduce.py:setup_django`

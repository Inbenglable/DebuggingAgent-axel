To properly address the issue, we need to examine the source code of the `ClearableFileInput` class's `use_required_attribute` method and perhaps also the `FileInput` class itself. The proposed solution involves moving the logic from one class method to another, indicating there might be a class hierarchy or interplay between these classes. Thus, we need to gather source codes for the methods and classes involved.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "ClearableFileInput")
search_method_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute")
search_class_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "FileInput")
search_method_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "FileInput.use_required_attribute")
```

To address the issue, it is necessary to identify and modify the relevant part of the SymPy code responsible for LaTeX rendering of `Subs`. In the SymPy codebase, LaTeX rendering is often handled by printer classes, such as `LatexPrinter`. Therefore, I need to find the method responsible for printing the `Subs` expressions in LaTeX format. It is most likely a method within the `LatexPrinter` class or a similar class.

Let's start by locating the method in the SymPy codebase that performs LaTeX rendering for the `Subs` object.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Subs")
search_method_in_codebase("LatexPrinter")
search_method_in_codebase("_print_Subs")
```

To address the issue, I need to retrieve the source code of the `get_object_members` method from the `ModuleDocumenter` class in the Sphinx `autodoc` extension. This allows me to modify the condition handling when `__all__` is empty.

I'll go ahead and fetch the source code using the following API call:

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py", "ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members")
```

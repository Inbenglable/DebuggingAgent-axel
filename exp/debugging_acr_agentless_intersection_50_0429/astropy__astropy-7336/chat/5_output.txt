The error occurs when using the `units.quantity_input` decorator from Astropy, specifically in processing the constructor `__init__`. The traceback indicates that the problematic section of code is attempting to convert a `NoneType` return value from a constructor (indicated by `-> None` in the function signature) to a unit using the `.to` method, which leads to an `AttributeError`.

This issue stems from the decorator's attempt to check return values against expected units when the function is annotated with a return type hint of `None`. Since constructors by definition do not return a value, the `return_.to(...)` call in the decorator fails because `return_` is `None`.

To resolve this, we should trace the relevant parts of the `astropy.units.decorators` module, particularly around where the decorator is attempting to access the `.to` method on the return object. 

Let's analyze the code within `astropy/units/decorators.py` in the method where the return value gets processed. The exception is raised in line 224 of this file, in the function denoted by `wrapper`.

Observed method: `astropy/units/decorators.py:wrapper`

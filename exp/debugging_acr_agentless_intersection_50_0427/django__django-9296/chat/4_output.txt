The analysis of the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior reveals that the `Paginator` class is missing the `__iter__` method, leading to the `TypeError` when iterating over a `MockPaginator` instance. The error traceback confirms that the issue arises when the code attempts to iterate directly over the `Paginator` (in this case, the `MockPaginator` subclass), which isn't possible without implementing the `__iter__` method.

To resolve this issue, the `__iter__` method needs to be added to the `Paginator` class. The line of code where the error arises (`for page in paginator:`) further emphasizes that a `TypeError` is raised because the `MockPaginator` object is not iterable.

Given that the `__iter__` method is not yet implemented and is the primary reason for the error:

Buggy method: `django/core/paginator.py:Paginator` (specifically, the class needs the `__iter__` method implemented).

To address the issue, we need to understand how Django's SQLite backend handles migrations, specifically when adding fields like OneToOneField with UNIQUE constraints. The error message indicates that there's an issue with adding UNIQUE columns in SQLite using an `ALTER TABLE` statement.

It's likely that resolving this requires altering how migrations interact with SQLite for such operations. To generate a patch, reviewing the implementation of migration operations in the SQLite backend of Django will be necessary.

Let's start by searching for relevant code, such as SQLite backend operations or migration operations.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("execute")
search_method_in_codebase("add_field")
search_code_in_codebase("ALTER TABLE")
search_class_in_codebase("SQLiteCursorWrapper")
search_class_in_codebase("Operation")
```

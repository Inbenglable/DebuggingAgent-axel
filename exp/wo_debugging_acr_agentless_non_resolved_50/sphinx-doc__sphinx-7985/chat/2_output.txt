To resolve the issue of `linkcheck` not verifying local (internal) links, I need to explore how the `linkcheck` command is implemented and where it handles link verification. This will help me determine where the changes need to be made to extend support for checking internal links.

To start, I will search for methods relating to the `linkcheck` process in the Sphinx codebase. The first step is to identify the method responsible for the `linkcheck` command execution within Sphinx. Typically, this will be linked to a method or a script that handles Sphinx builders or command execution.

I'll start by looking for a method named `linkcheck` or similar terms that may invoke link validation for Sphinx documentation.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("linkcheck")
```

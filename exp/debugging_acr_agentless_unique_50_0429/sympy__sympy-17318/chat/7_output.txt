To address the issue, it is essential to modify the `_split_gcd` method to gracefully handle the scenario where the input list is empty. Since this method might not have been retrieved yet, I need to search for its source code to understand its current implementation before proceeding with generating the patch.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/simplify/radsimp.py", "_split_gcd")
```

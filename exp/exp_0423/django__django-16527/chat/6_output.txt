To determine whether the issue has been resolved, let's analyze the patch and the test output:

### Patch Review

Reviewing the patch, the change made to the `submit_row` function in `admin_modify.py` involved adding a check for `has_add_permission` to the condition of the `show_save_as_new` key, as suggested in the issue description. This appears consistent with the issue's proposed solution.

### Test Output Analysis

**Before Applying the Patch:**
- The test ends with a `KeyError` for `has_view_permission`. This indicates that the test setup or the code relies on the presence of a key in the context dictionary that is not provided.

**After Applying the Patch:**
- The test continues to end with the same `KeyError` for `has_view_permission`, suggesting that the patch did not address or affect the condition causing the error (absence of the `has_view_permission` key in the context).

### Conclusion

The key error for `has_view_permission` is unrelated to the suggested addition of `has_add_permission`. However, this error prevents the test from correctly assessing whether the original issue (involving `show_save_as_new` and `has_add_permission`) has been resolved. Therefore, based on this test output, it's not possible to determine if the issue regarding `show_save_as_new` logic was adequately resolved because the test hasn't reached the assertion due to the preceding error.

To accurately verify if the bug is fixed, the test setup needs to be corrected to include necessary context keys or adjust the test condition accordingly.

**Issue resolved:** `False`

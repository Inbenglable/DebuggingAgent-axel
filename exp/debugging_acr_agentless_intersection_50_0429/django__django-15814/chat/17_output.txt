To assess whether the issue is resolved, let's review the details:

### Patch Impact Analysis
The patch modifies the method used to gather the primary key fields when working with `QuerySet.only()` and `select_related()` on proxy models, ensuring that `init_list` is populated with the correct primary key, referencing the proxy model's concrete class. This adjustment should address the `ValueError` by guaranteeing that the necessary fields like 'id' are included when constructing the query result set.

### Test Output Analysis
1. **Original Output**: The test originally failed with a `ModuleNotFoundError` because the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` was set to 'your_project', which did not exist. This error reflects an issue in the configuration rather than the patch itself, indicating that the test environment wasn't set up correctly.

2. **Patched Output**: The output remains the same with a `ModuleNotFoundError`, identical to the problem in the original output. This consistency in errors before and after the patch suggests that the patch has not been effectively tested.

### Conclusion
Given that both the original and patched test outputs indicate a `ModuleNotFoundError` unrelated to the specific bug, there is no way to confirm whether the patched code resolves the original issue without first rectifying the environment setup errors in the test.

Therefore, I cannot definitively say that the bug is fixed based on the provided data.

Issue resolved: `False`

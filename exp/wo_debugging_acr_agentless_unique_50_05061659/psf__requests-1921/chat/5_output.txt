After reviewing the API returned contents, we see that there's duplication in the results. Both contents refer to the same `merge_setting` function found in different paths within the requests codebase. The contents of the function are identical in both occurrences, indicating they are indeed relevant for the issue at hand because this function handles how settings (including headers) are merged in a session, which directly relates to the issue of removing a default header.

Since both results are the same function just replicated in different directories, either one of them would be sufficient, but they represent the same code needed for the analysis.

My selection of the needed function based on the API results is as follows:

```
requests/sessions.py:merge_setting
```

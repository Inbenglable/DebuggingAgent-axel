To handle properties correctly in the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass, we need to update the `__init__` method to also check if the member is a property. We will use `inspect.isdatadescriptor`, which returns `True` for properties. Here's the patch to fix the issue:

```pythony
### astropy/utils/misc.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            if (inspect.isfunction(val) and
                is_public_member(key) and
                val.__doc__ is None):
=======
            if ((inspect.isfunction(val) or inspect.isdatadescriptor(val)) and
                is_public_member(key) and
                val.__doc__ is None):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This modification ensures that the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass can properly inherit docstrings from both methods and properties. Here's the JSON representation of the edit:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### astropy/utils/misc.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            if (inspect.isfunction(val) and\n                is_public_member(key) and\n                val.__doc__ is None):\n=======\n            if ((inspect.isfunction(val) or inspect.isdatadescriptor(val)) and\n                is_public_member(key) and\n                val.__doc__ is None):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

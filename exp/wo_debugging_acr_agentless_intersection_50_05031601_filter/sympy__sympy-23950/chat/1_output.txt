The issue described involves the `Contains` class and its method `as_set`. We need to retrieve the relevant source code to understand how `as_set` is implemented and how we can modify it to make `Contains(x, Reals).as_set()` return a proper set instead of a `Contains` object. Additionally, it might be helpful to review how the `Contains` class is structured. Let's perform the necessary searches to locate the source code.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("Contains.as_set")
search_class_in_codebase("Contains")
```

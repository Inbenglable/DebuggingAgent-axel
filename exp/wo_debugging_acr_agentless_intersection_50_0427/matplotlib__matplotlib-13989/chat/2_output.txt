I need to retrieve the full implementation of the `hist()` method within the `gca()` context, as that's where the actual computation affecting the `range` and `density` parameters is managed. This will help me understand how these parameters are currently being processed to identify the cause of the issue.

Given that `hist()` in `pyplot.py` is a wrapper that delegates to `gca().hist()`, I should explore the `Axes` class in the Matplotlib library, as `gca()` returns the current `Axes` object. Hence, I'll look for the `Axes.hist()` method.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("Axes.hist")
```

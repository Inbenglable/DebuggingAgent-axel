To resolve the issue regarding `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension()`, I need to examine the source code of the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method in the `SI` class. This is necessary to understand how it currently handles the expressions and factors to identify why it fails to properly determine that the exponent is dimensionless.

I will use the `search_method_in_codebase` API to locate the method and start analysis since the file path is not provided directly.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("SI._collect_factor_and_dimension")
```

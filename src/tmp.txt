To address the issue that an empty `__all__` attribute in a module is ignored by the `autodoc` extension, I need to investigate how `autodoc` processes the modules and handles the `__all__` attribute specifically.

The processing of the module members is likely handled by a method or function within the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` extension, possibly as part of its module handling functions or classes. To fix this issue, I need to identify the relevant code that processes the `__all__` attribute.

To start, I will search for relevant methods that may handle module attributes within the autodoc extension. This typically involves the documentation generation logic in Sphinx.

Let's begin by searching for the method that handles module attribute processing, especially handling of the `__all__` attribute within the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` extension.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("get_module_members")
```

Based on the analysis and tracing efforts, I have identified that the bug likely resides in the `FunctionDocumenter.format_signature` method. This method is responsible for formatting function signatures, which could include misrepresentation of type hints, especially during the handling of class constructors. Therefore, a closer examination and modification of this method's source code are necessary to resolve the issue.

To proceed, I need to retrieve the source code for the `FunctionDocumenter.format_signature` method to fully understand how type hints are processed and to generate the appropriate patch.

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py", "FunctionDocumenter.format_signature")
```

After analyzing the returned contents, both snippets appear to be the same implementation for the `Session` class. However, they are located in different directories. 

Since both could potentially offer the same functionality, further investigation into the specific directory structure or project settings may be needed to determine the correct one. But assuming no additional context is provided that differentiates these two files, it makes sense to consider both locations as possibly relevant. Explicitly, we need to investigate the `requests/sessions.py` path since it likely corresponds to the main library directory.

Thus, the needed contents are:

```
requests/sessions.py:Session
```

To begin with, I'll create a minimal debugging test based on the reproducible test provided in the issue description. This debugging test will help isolate the problem with the `separability_matrix` function when dealing with nested compound models. I'll focus on simplifying the test while preserving the essential elements needed to replicate and investigate the issue.

Here's the debugging test in JSON format:

```json
{
"debugging_test": "from astropy.modeling import models as m\nfrom astropy.modeling.separable import separability_matrix\n\n# Simple compound model (used as control)\ncm = m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)\n\n# Nested compound model test\ntest_model = m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm\n\n# Debugging message indicating the start of the critical test\nprint('Debugging Test: Nested Compound Model')\nprint(separability_matrix(test_model))"
}
```

This test focuses on the nested compound model scenario since that's where the unexpected behavior is observed. The `print` statements will help us trace how the `separability_matrix` function processes the nested compound model.

## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
loaddata crashes on SQLite when table names are SQL keywords.
Description
	
Steps to reproduce:
Create a Model called Order. (order is a SQL reserved word)
Create fixtures for the model
Use manage.py loaddata to load the fixture.
Notice that it fails with the following error. This is because the table name order is not quoted properly

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
The test script is attempting to reproduce the issue with Django's `loaddata` command when using a model named `Order`, which corresponds to a table name that is a reserved SQL keyword. The provided script is failing with the error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'test_app'` during the `django.setup()` process when trying to populate the installed apps.

### Analysis

1. **Reproduction Code Structure**:
   - A Django settings configuration is being defined inline within the script, including `INSTALLED_APPS` with a fictional app `'test_app'`.
   - An `Order` model is defined directly in the script.
   - A fixture is created for this `Order` model and then loaded, which is where the original error is expected to reproduce.

2. **Current Failure**:
   - The script fails at `django.setup()` because Django is trying to load `'test_app'`, which is specified as part of `INSTALLED_APPS`, but a corresponding actual Django app/package does not exist, resulting in `ModuleNotFoundError`.
   
### Conclusion

The test script isn't correctly structured as a Django project with an actual Django app `'test_app'` set up in the environment where this script is being executed. This leads to an import error when Django tries to load applications listed in `INSTALLED_APPS`.

To proceed, the observed failure is not in the code being tested but in the test infrastructure setup. The test needs to be adjusted by either creating and registering a mock or temporary app properly in the test environment or modifying the approach to dynamically define apps within the same module where `INSTALLED_APPS` can access them correctly without relying on the import mechanism.

However, this error does not help us locate the problem with the `check_constraints` function in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py`, which is the ultimate goal.

### Next Step

We should examine the `check_constraints` method in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py` to confirm its behavior and the potential use of backticks. The goal is to verify and correct the SQL execution to properly handle reserved table names.

**Observed method: `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py:check_constraints`**
==================================================
### Analysis of Current Observed Code

The `check_constraints` method is designed to validate foreign key constraints on the specified tables within a SQLite database. The current implementation in lines 316-385 contains SQL statements in the following parts:

1. **Lines 326-332:**
   - `PRAGMA foreign_key_check(%s)` - This line attempts to execute the SQLite pragma to check for foreign key violations on specific tables. When the table name is a reserved keyword, it is not quoted correctly, leading to syntax errors.

2. **Lines 335-337:**
   - `PRAGMA foreign_key_list(%s)` - Similarly, this executes the SQLite pragma to retrieve a list of foreign keys in a table. Using reserved SQL keywords without quotes can also lead to issues here.

3. **Lines 340-345:**
   - SQL select statement: `SELECT %s, %s FROM %s WHERE rowid = %%s` - The table name (`%s`) here also requires quotes if it's a reserved keyword.

4. **SQLite Features:**
   - The block in lines 354-385 handles cases where `self.features.supports_pragma_foreign_key_check` is false, but doesn't seem directly affected by the issue as it's based on straight SQL joins rather than pragma commands.

### Abnormal Behavior

The observed abnormal behavior is a syntax error when executing the `PRAGMA foreign_key_check(order)` statement because the table name `order` isn't quoted. SQLite requires quoting reserved words, which are treated here as table names, using backticks for proper execution:

- **Expected Correction**: Replace `PRAGMA foreign_key_check(%s)` with `PRAGMA foreign_key_check(`%s`)` or use a safe quoting mechanism.

### Path Forward

To identify the root cause and locate the buggy method and code, we need to trace the behavior of specific lines that are contributing to the SQL syntax errors by observing how the table names are handled and passed to the SQL statements.

**Observed scope**: `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py:326-331`

We need to check downstream how the table names are formatted in SQL queries, particularly focusing on:
- How the table names (`table_name`) are being interpolated into SQL statements.
- Ensuring quotes are added around table names that are reserved SQL keywords. 

Once the erroneous behavior in these lines is confirmed, it will be necessary to apply the correct quoting to the affected SQL statement parts.
==================================================
### Analysis of Current Observed Code

The currently observed code is part of the `DatabaseWrapper.check_constraints` method in the `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py` file. The relevant lines (326-331) manage foreign key constraint checks by executing SQL pragma statements. These lines attempt to check foreign key constraints using:

- **Line 327:** `PRAGMA foreign_key_check` for all table names when `table_names` is `None`.
- **Lines 329-331:** `PRAGMA foreign_key_check(%s)` for each table provided in `table_names`.

The problem arises particularly with the latter (`PRAGMA foreign_key_check(%s)`) where `table_name` is being directly included in the SQL statement without being properly quoted. This leads to syntax errors when `table_name` is a reserved SQL keyword, like `order`.

### Abnormal Behavior

The runtime error indicates an `AssertionError` in a separate test script, which is related to a test setup issue (`conda run` failure). The error suggests a missing file path, unrelated to this direct code, indicating that the problem lies in the test infrastructure rather than this specific code logic.

Nonetheless, the abnormal behavior within the Django code context is the use of reserved words (like `order`) as table names not being quoted, which should be corrected to prevent syntax errors in SQL statements.

### Conclusion

The code snippet provided underscores the unpreparedness for handling table names that are SQL keywords, requiring proper quoting.

### Next Steps

To pinpoint the root cause and locate the specific buggy code or method, analyzing how table names are passed and manipulated for SQL execution is crucial.

Given the issue pertains to quoting in SQL queries, particularly affecting SQLite, the focus should remain on methods that manipulate or execute these specific queries.

### Decision

The current analysis suggests focusing on the observed lines to ensure appropriate handling of reserved SQL keywords within the SQL queries.

Observed method: `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py:DatabaseWrapper.check_constraints`
==================================================
### Analysis of Current Observed Code

The `check_constraints` method in the `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py` file is responsible for checking foreign key constraints using SQLite pragma statements. The key areas of interest here are lines 326-331 and lines 335-337, which execute:

1. **Line 327:** `PRAGMA foreign_key_check` for all tables if `table_names` is `None`. This command checks for any foreign key violations across all tables.
  
2. **Lines 329-331:** `PRAGMA foreign_key_check(%s)` for specific tables listed in `table_names`. This is where syntax errors occur if a table name without quotes is a reserved SQL keyword.

3. **Lines 335-337:** `PRAGMA foreign_key_list(%s)` - Similarly, pragma command to list foreign keys within the specified table, subject to errors if table names are reserved keywords without quotes.

### Abnormal Program Behavior

The issue being that table names that are SQL reserved keywords, like `order`, cause syntax errors in these pragma commands when not quoted. The runtime error that appears unrelated is due to testing infrastructure failures (`conda run` error), emphasizing problems unrelated to this code logic.

### Conclusion

The abnormal behavior centers on using SQL reserved words as table names without quoting them, leading to SQLite syntax errors. Fixing requires quoting table names in SQL statements where potential collisions with reserved keywords can occur.

### Next Steps

Given this focus on quoting table names, further tracing should confirm how these names are included in SQL statements without proper quoting.

**Decision:**

Given the scope of my analysis, I'll examine the primary abnormal method lines to verify how table names handle quoting for SQL queries. This should allow pinpointing necessary changes directly affecting SQL execution.

**Observed scope: `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py:329-331`**

By observing this scope, we'll identify if the direct inclusion of SQL keywords as table names within SQL queries accounts for syntax errors, confirming the root cause and allowing corrections for proper execution.
==================================================
### Analysis of Current Observed Code and Abnormal Program Behavior

The observed snippet in the `DatabaseWrapper.check_constraints` method involves executing a SQL pragma statement:

```python
violations = chain.from_iterable(
    cursor.execute('PRAGMA foreign_key_check(%s)' % table_name).fetchall()
    for table_name in table_names
)
```

**Abnormal Behavior:**

The abnormal behavior arises due to a potential syntax error when executing the SQLite `PRAGMA foreign_key_check` statement. The error occurs when `table_name` is an SQL reserved word, such as `order`, and is inserted directly into the SQL query without proper quoting. This results in a syntax error as SQLite interprets the reserved word as part of the SQL syntax rather than a table name.

**Next Steps:**

To correctly handle reserved words, table names should be enclosed in quotes. For SQLite, this typically involves using backticks or double quotes around table names. 

Given the observed snippet, it's highly probable that the issue lies within this section of the code since it directly constructs and executes SQL statements involving potentially reserved keywords as table names.

### Conclusion

The problem is now clear: the `PRAGMA foreign_key_check(%s)` statement can fail when `table_name` is a reserved SQL word and not properly quoted.

**Buggy Method:**

The proposed fix involves altering the SQL execution statement to properly quote table names:

- Convert the line:
  ```python
  cursor.execute('PRAGMA foreign_key_check(%s)' % table_name)
  ```
  to:
  ```python
  cursor.execute(f'PRAGMA foreign_key_check("{table_name}")')
  ```

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

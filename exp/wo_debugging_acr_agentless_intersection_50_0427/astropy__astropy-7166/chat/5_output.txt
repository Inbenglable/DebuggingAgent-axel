To resolve the issue with the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass handling properties, the patch will modify the `__init__` method to include property objects when inheriting docstrings. Here is the patch in the required format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### astropy/utils/misc.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            if (inspect.isfunction(val) and\n=======\n            if ((inspect.isfunction(val) or isinstance(val, property)) and\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch modifies the conditional check within the loop to allow for property objects, ensuring that their docstrings are also inherited from the base class, thus resolving the issue.

To resolve the issue, we need to focus specifically on how pytest deals with the `--pdb` option, especially in the context of skipped tests when using the `unittest` framework. The most relevant content would involve configurations related to debugging and the skipping mechanism as they pertain to the `--pdb` option.

- `src/_pytest/debugging.py:pytest_configure`: This seems relevant because it directly deals with configuring debugging tools, including `pdb`, which is what the issue is about (`--pdb` triggering when it shouldn't for a skipped test).
  
- `src/_pytest/skipping.py:pytest_configure`: This file likely handles configuration related to skipping tests. Since the issue involves understanding how skipped tests are treated with `--pdb`, this is also relevant.

I will select these two for further analysis:

```
src/_pytest/debugging.py:pytest_configure
src/_pytest/skipping.py:pytest_configure
```

To address the issue, I need to identify the `changelist_view` method in Django's admin views code. This method is responsible for handling the display and editing of items in the admin list view.

To do this, I will search for the `changelist_view` method in the Django codebase since the specific file path is not known. Once found, it will be necessary to fetch the surrounding code to understand how to correctly apply transaction handling.

Here's how I will proceed to obtain the necessary source code:

```python
search_method_in_codebase("changelist_view")
```

To address the issue, it appears that I need to adjust the `use_required_attribute` method so that it doesn't render the `required` attribute when there's initial data. The method `use_required_attribute` for `ClearableFileInput` currently checks for initial data correctly, but this logic needs to be applied in the `FileInput` class as well.

The `FileInput` class doesn't currently have a `use_required_attribute` method implemented, so I will need to add one. I have identified where this method should be integrated but have not yet retrieved the full code implementation of the `ClearableFileInput` class, which can provide useful insights into implementing the logic.

Let's retrieve the class details for `ClearableFileInput` to ensure that the new method aligns with how this class manages its behavior, especially any relevant inheritance or default behavior.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "ClearableFileInput")
```

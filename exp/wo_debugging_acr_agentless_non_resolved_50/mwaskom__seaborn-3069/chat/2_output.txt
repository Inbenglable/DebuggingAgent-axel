To resolve the issue, we need to ensure that the `Nominal` scales behave similarly to categorical scales in terms of axis margin settings, grid visibility, and axis inversion, when used with `seaborn` plots. 

The methods we need to explore further are:
1. `Plotter._finalize_figure`: We already have its source code.
2. `Nominal._setup`: It's likely within the `Nominal` class and could be relevant because it might influence how the nominal scales are configured.
3. The categorization and selection logic within the `Nominal` class for handling `Nominal` scales and how it interacts with the plot settings.

Given that I have seen `Nominal.setup` hinted for modification, I will retrieve the source code for `Nominal._setup` if not fully visible already, to ensure we can make the necessary adjustments for aligning the nominal scale behavior with categorical scale traits.

```python
search_method_in_file("seaborn/_core/scales.py", "Nominal._setup")
```

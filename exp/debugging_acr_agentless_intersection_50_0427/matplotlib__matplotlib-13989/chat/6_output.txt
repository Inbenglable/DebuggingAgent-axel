The current observed code in the `Axes.hist` method indicates that the `hist_kwargs` dictionary is initially assigned the `range` value, which matches what we expect with `hist_kwargs['range'] = bin_range`. However, shortly thereafter, when `density=True` and `stacked=False`, the `hist_kwargs` dictionary is overwritten with just `dict(density=density)`. This effectively removes the previously assigned `range`, leading to a situation where `np.histogram` is called without the `range` parameter.

This suggests that the overwrite is unintentional and contributes to the observed abnormal behavior as the `range` parameter is not respected. The problematic behavior is introduced in lines:

```python
       if density and not stacked:
           hist_kwargs = dict(density=density)
```

Therefore, the bug arises from overwriting `hist_kwargs`, which removes the `range` parameter needed for histogram computation.

Based on this analysis, I can already locate the buggy method and the buggy code:

Buggy method: `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py:Axes.hist`

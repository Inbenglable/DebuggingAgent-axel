To address the issue and create a patch, I will need the source code for the `_parallel_poly_from_expr` method in `sympy/polys/polytools.py` to understand how it handles Piecewise constructs and interacts with assumptions. Once I have its code, I will proceed with generating the patch.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/polys/polytools.py", "_parallel_poly_from_expr")
```

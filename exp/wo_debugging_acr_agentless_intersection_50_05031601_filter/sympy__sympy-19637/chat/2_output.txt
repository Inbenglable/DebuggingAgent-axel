The issue in the `kernS` function is that the variable `kern` might be accessed before it is assigned. This occurs when there are no spaces in the input string `s`, causing the part that assigns a value to `kern` never to execute. To fix this, we need to declare `kern` and assign it a default value before it is potentially used, ensuring it is always defined.

Since I've already obtained the source code of the `kernS` function and identified the issue, I am ready to generate a patch.

Ready generation: `True`

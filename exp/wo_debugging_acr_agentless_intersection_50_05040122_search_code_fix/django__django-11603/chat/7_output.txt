To add DISTINCT support to the `Avg` and `Sum` classes, we can set `allow_distinct = True` in these classes, similar to how it is done in the `Count` class. Let's create the necessary patch now. 

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):\n    function = 'AVG'\n    name = 'Avg'\n=======\nclass Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):\n    function = 'AVG'\n    name = 'Avg'\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):\n    function = 'SUM'\n    name = 'Sum'\n=======\nclass Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):\n    function = 'SUM'\n    name = 'Sum'\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

These changes add the `allow_distinct = True` attribute to both the `Avg` and `Sum` classes, enabling support for DISTINCT in these aggregates.

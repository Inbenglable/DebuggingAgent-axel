The reported issue involves incorrect rendering of a 1-element tuple as a normal integer. The main problem encountered when trying to reproduce this issue is the failure to import `ast2commentedcode` from `sphinx.pycode.ast`, indicating that this function may not exist or has been moved or renamed.

First, we need to confirm that the function `ast2commentedcode` is used for converting ASTs to commented code strings as expected. The key step is to identify where the code responsible for handling 1-element tuple rendering is implemented.

Before identifying further areas to observe, I'll check where `ast2commentedcode` should be located and how it processes tuples. I need to inspect `sphinx.pycode.ast` for relevant methods or functionality related to AST or code conversion.

Let's explore the methods in `sphinx/pycode/ast.py` to understand where the 1-element tuple could be incorrectly processed.

Observed method: `sphinx/pycode/ast.py`

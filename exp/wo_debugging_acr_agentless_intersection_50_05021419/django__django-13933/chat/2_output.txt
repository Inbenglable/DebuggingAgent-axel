To address the issue, we need to modify the `ModelChoiceField` class to include the invalid value in the error message when a validation error occurs. The focus is on the `validate` method, which is responsible for checking if the value is valid and raising a `ValidationError` with an appropriate message when it isn't.

I need to review the current implementation of the `validate` method in the `ModelChoiceField` class to make this change.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/forms/models.py", "ModelChoiceField.validate")
```

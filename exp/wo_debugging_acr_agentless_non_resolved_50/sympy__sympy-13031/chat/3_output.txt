To address the issue, I must retrieve the source code of the `MatrixShaping.hstack` method which I have already identified in the file `sympy/matrices/common.py`. I want to ensure that I have the complete context of the method implementation to make any needed adjustments. I will proceed to retrieve this source code.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/matrices/common.py", "MatrixShaping.hstack")
```

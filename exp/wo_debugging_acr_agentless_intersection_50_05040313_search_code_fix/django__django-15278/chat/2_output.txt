To resolve the issue, we need to focus on parts of the Django codebase that handle SQLite operations, especially those involving executing SQL queries and dealing with database migrations. The bug is related to the `ALTER TABLE` operation when adding a UNIQUE constraint, so our focus should be on methods or classes that impact this functionality. Let's analyze each API returned content:

### Analysis:

1. **django/db/backends/utils.py:CursorDebugWrapper.execute**
   - This is a utility wrapper around cursor execution. It could be useful in terms of debugging SQL queries but not likely to be directly related to the issue.

2. **django/db/backends/base/schema.py:BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.execute**
   - This method is responsible for executing SQL statements, including ALTER TABLE commands, during schema migrations. It's likely relevant to the issue as the bug involves the failing execution of such a statement.

3. **django/db/backends/oracle/base.py:FormatStylePlaceholderCursor.execute**
   - This is specific to Oracle, so it's irrelevant to the SQLite issue.

4. **django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py:SQLiteCursorWrapper.execute**
   - This method encapsulates query execution for SQLite, particularly converting queries. Directly related to SQLite backend, so it's relevant.

5. **django/db/backends/mysql/base.py:CursorWrapper.execute**
   - Specific to MySQL, hence irrelevant for the SQLite-related issue.

6. **django/core/management/base.py:BaseCommand.execute**
   - This method is related to the execution of management commands, not directly related to SQL execution or schema migrations.

7. **django/core/management/__init__.py:ManagementUtility.execute**
   - Related to command-line utilities, hence not directly concerned with database operations.

8. **django/core/management/commands/runserver.py:Command.execute**
   - Execution for the `runserver` command, not related to database operations.

9. **django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py:Command.execute**
   - Executes migrations as SQL, but primarily for output purposes rather than execution context in this scenario.

10. **django/contrib/auth/management/commands/createsuperuser.py:Command.execute**
    - Executes the superuser creation command, unrelated to this migration issue.

### Needed Contents:

Based on the analysis above, the following contents are relevant for addressing the issue of adding nullable OneToOneField that crashes on SQLite:

```
django/db/backends/base/schema.py:BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.execute
django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py:SQLiteCursorWrapper.execute
```

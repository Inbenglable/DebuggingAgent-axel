To resolve the issue, we need to modify the implementation of the PostgreSQL client in Django's database backend to use `subprocess.run` and set the environment variable `PGPASSWORD`. To make this change, I need to locate and review the source code for the relevant client method in `django.db.backends.postgres`.

Let's search for the method responsible for handling the PostgreSQL client operations in Django's PostgreSQL backend.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("client")
search_class_in_codebase("PostgreSQLDatabaseWrapper")
```

To resolve the issue, I need to modify the `execute_sql_flush` method in the `django/db/backends/base/operations.py` file to remove the `using` parameter and infer it from `self.connection.alias`. The method source code is already provided in the debugging history:

```python
403    def execute_sql_flush(self, using, sql_list):
404        """Execute a list of SQL statements to flush the database."""
405        with transaction.atomic(using=using, savepoint=self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl):
406            with self.connection.cursor() as cursor:
407                for sql in sql_list:
408                    cursor.execute(sql)
```

Since I already have the necessary source code of the `execute_sql_flush` method, I'm ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

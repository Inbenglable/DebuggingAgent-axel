The root cause of the issue is within the `symbols` function, specifically how it handles recursion when tuples of names are passed. This function should carry the `cls` argument across recursive calls to ensure that instances of the specified class are created, even with nested inputs.

The source code for the `symbols` function has been provided, and I can see where the necessary adjustments need to be made. The primary focus will be to ensure that the `cls` argument is maintained during recursion.

With the information and code I have, I am ready to generate a patch for the issue.

Ready generation: `True`

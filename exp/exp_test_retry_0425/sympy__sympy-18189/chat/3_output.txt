To resolve the issue, I need to examine the `diophantine` method in the `sympy/solvers/diophantine.py` file to understand how the permutations and symbol order are handled. This will allow me to identify how the logic can be corrected to provide consistent results regardless of the order of symbols provided. 

I'll retrieve the source code for the `diophantine` function to understand its current implementation.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/solvers/diophantine.py", "diophantine")
```

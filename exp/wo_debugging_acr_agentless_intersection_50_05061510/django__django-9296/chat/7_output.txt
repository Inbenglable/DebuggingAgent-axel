To determine whether the issue is resolved, we need to analyze the patch and its effects on the code, along with the output before and after applying the patch.

1. **Patch Review:**

   - The patch aims to add an `__iter__` method to the `Paginator` class in `django/core/paginator.py`.
   - The `__iter__` method would iterate over the page range and yield page objects sequentially.
   - However, there is an indentation error (`IndentationError`) in the patched output, which suggests that the `__iter__` method was not correctly integrated into the file structure.

2. **Original Test Output:**

   - Before the patch, attempting to iterate over a `Paginator` object raises a `TypeError`, indicating that the object is not iterable. This confirms the issue is present as described.

3. **Patched Test Output:**

   - After applying the patch, a traceback results in an `IndentationError`. This error occurs due to incorrect indentation for the newly introduced `__iter__` method in `django/core/paginator.py`.
   - The indentation error prevents successful execution of the test and suggests that the patch was not successfully implemented or incorrectly formatted.

**Conclusion:**

The issue is still present because the patch was not correctly applied due to an `IndentationError`. Consequently, the `Paginator` object still lacks the `__iter__` method functionality, and the iteration does not work as expected.

Issue resolved: `False`

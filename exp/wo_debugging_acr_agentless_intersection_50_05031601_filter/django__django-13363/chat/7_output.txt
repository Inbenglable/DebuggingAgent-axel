To determine whether the issue is resolved, let's review the following aspects:

1. **Patch Review:**
    - The patch modified the `as_sql()` methods in both `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` classes to correctly use the `tzinfo` object passed by the user instead of the default timezone. This aligns with the issue description, which stated that the current implementation did not use the passed timezone info object as expected.

2. **Test Output Analysis:**
    - **Original and Patched Output:** Both outputs show the same error `django.db.utils.OperationalError: no such table: __main___timeslots`. This indicates that there was no change in the behavior of the test with respect to the issue described. This error suggests a database setup issue, not directly related to the business logic of the functionality being tested.
    - Since the error indicates a missing table, the real issue in concern (timezone handling in `TruncDate` and `TruncTime`) was never reached or tested successfully due to this setup failure.

3. **Conclusion:**
    - Without resolving the database setup error, it is impossible to ascertain whether the logic for timezone handling is fixed by the patch or not. The testing procedure itself didn't confirm the resolution due to a setup issue.

As a result, under the current circumstances and without proper execution of the logic, the issue cannot be confirmed as resolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

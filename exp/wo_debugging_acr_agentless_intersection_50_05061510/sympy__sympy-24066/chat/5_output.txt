The patch modifies the `UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension` method to correctly identify when the expression within a function is dimensionless. Specifically, it checks if all arguments of a function have dimensionless dimensions and, if so, returns `Dimension(1)`. This approach is particularly applicable to functions like `exp`, where the exponent must be dimensionless.

### Analysis

1. **Patch Review**:
   - The method now evaluates whether all dimensions within function arguments are dimensionless.
   - If they are dimensionless, it returns `Dimension(1)` for the whole function, which aligns with the behavior of functions like the exponential function, `exp`.

2. **Test Output Before Patch**:
   - The original test results show a `ValueError` indicating that the dimension of `exp(second/(farad*ohm))` is incorrectly identified, leading to the test failure.
   - An assertion error confirms that the issue is present.

3. **Test Output After Patch**:
   - The output is empty, which implies no exceptions are raised.
   - This suggests that the assertion error was not triggered, meaning the dimensional analysis for `exp(second/(farad*ohm))` has been successfully recognized as dimensionless.

### Conclusion

Based on the patch's logic and the change in test output (from a failed assertion to no error), the issue appears to be resolved. The patch aligns with the expectations outlined in the issue report: handling dimensionless exponents correctly. 

Issue resolved: `True`

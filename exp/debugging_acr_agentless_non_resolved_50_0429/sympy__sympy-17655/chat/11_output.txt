To determine whether the issue is resolved, let's go through the patch and the test results before and after applying the patch.

### Patch Analysis:
1. **Modification**: 
   - The patch modifies the `Point.__add__` method to handle scalar multiplications resulting in a `Mul` object.
   - It introduces conditional logic that first checks if `other` is an instance of `Mul`. If so, it extracts the scalar factor and the `Point` from the multiplicand and scales the point coordinates accordingly before proceeding with the addition.
   - Otherwise, it falls back to the original implementation for objects that are not `Mul`.

### Original Output:
- The original code results in an exception when attempting `point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2`, specifically a `GeometryError` due to incorrect handling of the `Mul` object.

### Patched Output:
- The patched output demonstrates a `SyntaxError`. This indicates a problem with the code structure or syntax introduced by the patch.

### Conclusion:
The presence of a `SyntaxError` in the patched output suggests that the patch has not been successfully implemented due to invalid syntax. This means that the corrected functionality has not even been tested properly because of the syntax issue. As such, the issue presented in the original output has not been addressed.

Issue resolved: `False`

First, let's review the patch and analyze the test outputs:

### Review of the Patch:
1. **Patch Change**: 
   - The patch modifies the function `check_anchor` in `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py` to add a check for the HTTP response status before inspecting the anchor.
   - The patch replaces `requests.requests.Response` with `requests.Response`.

2. **Comments**:
   - Comments were adjusted to clarify the logic around readability.

### Analysis of Test Outputs:

1. **Original Output**:
   - The original output indicates a `FileNotFoundError`, as the test setup didn't create the necessary directories before writing to `conf.py`.

2. **Patched Output**:
   - The patched output indicates an `AttributeError`: the module 'sphinx.util.requests' does not have the attribute `Response`.

### Correctness and Conclusion:

1. **Patch Issue**:
   - The patch incorrectly assumed 'requests' as available under 'sphinx.util' namespace, which led to an AttributeError because there is no `Response` class directly available in `sphinx.util.requests`.

2. **Other Concerns**:
   - The patch did not address the `FileNotFoundError` seen in the test setup, which is unrelated but crucial for successful test execution.

### Final Determination:
Given the AttributeError in the patched output, it's clear that the patch did not successfully resolve the issue since it introduced a new error related to the request handling. Thus:
 
Issue resolved: `False`

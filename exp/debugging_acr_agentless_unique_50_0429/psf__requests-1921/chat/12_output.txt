To determine whether the issue is resolved, let's review the patch and the test output before and after applying the patch.

### Patch Review
The patch modifies the `requests/models.py` file by updating the line where headers are initialized with `CaseInsensitiveDict`. The patch adds a condition to filter out headers with `None` values:

```python
self.headers = CaseInsensitiveDict((to_native_string(name), value) for name, value in headers.items() if value is not None)
```

This ensures that any header with a `None` value will not be included in the headers dictionary, preventing them from being sent with the value "None" as before.

### Test Output Review
- **Original Output:** The test gave a `TypeError` because the `None` value was not a valid header value.
  
- **Patched Output:** The output now shows the headers being sent, and importantly, the `Accept-Encoding` header is not included, which indicates it has been effectively removed.

The patch correctly resolves the issue by ensuring headers set to `None` are omitted from the request, aligning with the intended behavior described in the issue.

Based on this analysis:
Issue resolved: `True`

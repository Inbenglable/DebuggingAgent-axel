To address the issue, I need to modify the `Dataset.merge` method to handle the situation where it is called with a `DataArray`. In the `merge` function, `DataArray` objects are converted to `Dataset` objects using the `to_dataset()` method.

To fix the bug, I need to adapt similar logic in the `Dataset.merge` method to convert a `DataArray` to a `Dataset` before proceeding with the merge operation.

I've already obtained the source code for both the `Dataset.merge` method and the top-level `merge` function. Therefore, I'm ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

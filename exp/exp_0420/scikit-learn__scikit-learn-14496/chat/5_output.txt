I need to review the source code of the `compute_optics_graph` function within the same file `sklearn/cluster/optics_.py` to understand where exactly the changes should be made before the `NearestNeighbors` instantiation is called.

Let's proceed with retrieving the source code of the `compute_optics_graph` function next.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/cluster/optics_.py", "compute_optics_graph")
```

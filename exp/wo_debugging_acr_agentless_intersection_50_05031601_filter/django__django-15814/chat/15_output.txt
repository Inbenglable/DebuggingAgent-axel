Based on the analysis of the code snippet around line 748 in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` and considering the issue described, the patch should modify the assignment of `opts` to correctly handle the proxy model situation by using the `concrete_model`. This way, it will prevent the crash on proxy models.

Here's the patch in the required format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/sql/query.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                opts = cur_model._meta\n=======\n                opts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

To determine if the issue is resolved, let's review the information provided:

### Patch Review:
The provided patch code aims to correct the order of `prepend_indices` during the final merging step in `kahane_simplify`. Here's a breakdown of the corrections:

- **Original Code**: 
  ```python
  expr1 = prepend_indices
  expr2 = list(reversed(prepend_indices))
  resulting_indices = [expri + ri for ri in resulting_indices for expri in (expr1, expr2)]
  ```

- **Patched Code**:
  ```python
  resulting_indices = [prepend_indices + ri for ri in resulting_indices]
  ```

The patch replaced sequences within `resulting_indices` to avoid reversing `prepend_indices`, maintaining their original order.

### Test Output Analysis:

- **Original Output**:
  The test outputs:
  ```
  4*GammaMatrix(rho)*GammaMatrix(sigma)
  4*GammaMatrix(sigma)*GammaMatrix(rho)
  AssertionError
  ```
  The error indicates that the second scenario flipped the order of the gamma matrices, leading to an `AssertionError`.

- **Patched Output**:
  After applying the patch, the test outputs:
  ```
  4*GammaMatrix(rho)*GammaMatrix(sigma)
  4*GammaMatrix(sigma)*GammaMatrix(rho)
  AssertionError
  ```
  The output remains unchanged with an `AssertionError`, indicating the patch has not resolved the issue.

### Conclusion:
Since both outputs are identical and the assertion errors persist after the patch application, the bug remains unresolved.

**Issue resolved**: `False`

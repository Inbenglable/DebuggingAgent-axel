To generate a patch for the issue described, I need to understand how the `caplog` fixture works, especially the part that handles setting and restoring log levels. This likely involves the method that sets the log level and ensures it's restored after a test.

First, I will search for the `caplog` fixture code to understand how it manipulates log levels and find the specific method or class responsible for this behavior.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("caplog")
```

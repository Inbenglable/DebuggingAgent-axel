Upon reviewing the provided patch and the before-and-after test outputs, it seems the issue persists despite the patch application. The error indicating "no such table: __main___timeslots" occurs both before and after the patch, suggesting that the test setup has a problem with creating or accessing the required database table. This correlates with how the patch does not address the error shown in the output, as the error stems from the test configuration.

The issue with adding support for `tzinfo` parameter to `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` is not conclusively resolved at this step. The provided patch attempts to modify the SQL generation process to incorporate a user-specified timezone, but without a successful execution of the test, we cannot determine if the patch correctly fixes the functional bug described.

Issue resolved: `False`

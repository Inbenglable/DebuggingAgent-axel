To resolve the issue regarding the squashed migration not being marked as unapplied, I need to retrieve the source code of the `unapply_migration` method from the `MigrationExecutor` class in the `django/db/migrations/executor.py` file. This method is likely responsible for handling the logic related to unapplying migrations, and it might need adjustment to correctly mark squashed migrations as unapplied.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/executor.py", "MigrationExecutor.unapply_migration")
```

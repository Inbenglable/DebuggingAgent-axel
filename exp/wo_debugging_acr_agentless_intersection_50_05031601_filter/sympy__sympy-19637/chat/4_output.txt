Upon reviewing the patch and the test outputs, here's the analysis:

1. **Issue Summary**: The function `kernS` attempts to use the variable `kern` without having initialized it, leading to an `UnboundLocalError`.

2. **Patch Analysis**: The patch initializes the `kern` variable at the beginning of the function with an empty string (`kern = ''`). This initialization ensures that `kern` is defined before being accessed, which directly addresses the `UnboundLocalError`.

3. **Test Output Before Patch**: The original output exhibits an `UnboundLocalError`, indicating that `kern` was accessed without being initialized.

4. **Test Output After Patch**: The patched output is empty, which implies there are no exceptions raised, and thus, no `UnboundLocalError` occurs.

5. **Conclusion**: The patch solves the problem by initializing `kern`, as confirmed by the absence of errors in the test output after applying the patch.

Issue resolved: `True`

Based on the information provided, let's analyze the situation:

### Original Issue
The `_image()` function is failing on `PermutationGroups` due to incorrect handling when `r[i]` is an inverted generator, leading to a failure in the `in gens` test.

### Original Output
The test before the patch results in a `ValueError`, confirming the presence of the bug: "The given images do not define a homomorphism".

### Applied Patch
The patch attempts to fix this by simplifying the handling of inverted generators through two main changes:
1. Simplifying the conditional check for `PermutationGroup`.
2. Adjusting the handling of inverses with inline assignment (`:=`).

### Patched Output
After applying the patch, the output indicates a syntax issue, specifically an `IndentationError`, which suggests there's a problem with the code formatting. The patch does not correctly apply due to a missing indentation level in the code.

### Conclusion
Since the patched output results in a syntax error, this indicates that the patch fix was not successfully implemented and would prevent the test from running at all. Thus, the intended correction of the bug within `_image()` does not occur, and we cannot conclude the functionality is fixed based on the execution of the patch code.

Issue resolved: `False`

I need to retrieve the source code for the ReprPrinter class's `reprify` and any potential methods like `_print_dict` and `_print_set`, which might be dealing with dictionary and set printing. Since these precise methods weren't present in the listing, I'll check the implementations of `reprify` as it might help handle these structures.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/repr.py", "ReprPrinter.reprify")
```

The `_wrap_in_pandas_container` method is where the data transformation occurs, resulting in dtype conversion. As outlined in the function's implementation, there currently isn't any provision to preserve the dtypes of the input data when converting to a pandas DataFrame. To address the issue, I need to modify `_wrap_in_pandas_container` to implement dtype preservation logic.

Since I already have the source code for the method, I'll proceed with generating the patch to implement the dtype preservation feature.

Ready generation: `True`

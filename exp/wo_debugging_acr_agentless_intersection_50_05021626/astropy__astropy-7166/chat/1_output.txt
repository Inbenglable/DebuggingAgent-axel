To address the issue with the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass not working for properties, I need to examine the implementation of the `InheritDocstrings` class. This will help me identify where and how the `inspect.isfunction` is being used and make necessary modifications to handle properties appropriately. Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code for the `InheritDocstrings` class.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("InheritDocstrings")
```

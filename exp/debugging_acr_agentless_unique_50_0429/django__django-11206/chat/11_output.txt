To determine whether the issue is resolved, let's examine both the patch and the output of the test before and after it was applied.

### Patch Review

1. **Patch Changes**:
   - The patch modifies the handling of localization settings to prevent the `ImproperlyConfigured` error by introducing checks using `hasattr`.
   - It attempts to fix decimal formatting to avoid scientific notation when `decimal_pos` is provided, replacing the prior logic for very small decimals with zero formatting.

### Test Output Review

#### Original Output (Before Patch)
- The error encountered is `ImproperlyConfigured`, indicating that the Django settings are not correctly configured.
- This error needs to be resolved before addressing the issue with number formatting.

#### Patched Output
- The same `ImproperlyConfigured` error persists after applying the patch, indicating that the patch did not successfully address the error related to settings configuration. 
- As the settings are not properly configured, the test related to number formatting could not be effectively executed.

### Conclusion
- The patch attempted to address both settings configuration and number formatting but failed to resolve the `ImproperlyConfigured` settings error. This error prevented the test from running to completion, thus not verifying if the formatting issue itself was resolved.
  
Since the core issue (correct number formatting without scientific notation) wasn't able to be tested due to the persistent configuration error, the overall problem remains unresolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

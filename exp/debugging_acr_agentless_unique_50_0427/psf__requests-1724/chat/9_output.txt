To resolve the issue, I need to make changes in the `PreparedRequest.prepare_method` method, but I don't currently have the source code for this method. Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code for `PreparedRequest.prepare_method` in order to generate the patch.

```python
search_method_in_file("requests/models.py", "PreparedRequest.prepare_method")
```

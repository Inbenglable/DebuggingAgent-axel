Here is the patch to address the issue with the `Documenter.filter_members` method in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`. This patch adds logic to respect an empty `__all__` attribute by ensuring that no module-level members are documented when `__all__` is empty.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        for obj in members:\n=======\n        all_members = getattr(self.object, '__all__', None)\n        if all_members is not None and not all_members:\n            # Respect empty __all__: document no members\n            return []\n\n        for obj in members:\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch modifies the `filter_members` method to check if `__all__` is explicitly defined and empty. If so, it returns an empty list, effectively preventing the documentation of any members not explicitly listed in `__all__`.

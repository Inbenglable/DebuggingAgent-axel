To identify the root cause of the issue, we'll first need to understand how the `:kbd:` role transforms the input into HTML. Let's analyze the method responsible for processing the `:kbd:` role inside Sphinx.

Given the issue description, the problematic code appears to be related to how the `:kbd:` role handles compound-key separators such as `-`, `+`, and `^`. This suggests an issue with the parsing or handling of these characters.

Let's trace beginning that process by observing the implementation of the `:kbd:` role.

Observed method: `sphinx/roles.py:kbd_role`

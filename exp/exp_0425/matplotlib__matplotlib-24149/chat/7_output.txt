The patch modifies the `_safe_first_finite` function to handle cases where all elements in the input are non-finite. Before the patch, the code raised a `StopIteration` error when attempting to find a finite value in an input that only contains `np.nan` values, which led to an unhandled exception.

### Patch Analysis
- The original logic returned the first finite value in an iterable, raising a `StopIteration` implicitly if none were found.
- The updated patch explicitly checks if there are any finite values and raises a `ValueError` with a clear message ("No finite values found in the input.") if no finite values are present.
- This makes the error handling more robust, providing a clear indication and a controlled failure mode instead of an unhandled exception.

### Test Output Analysis
- **Original Output**: Before applying the patch, attempting to plot bars with only `np.nan` values triggers an unhandled `StopIteration`, causing the program to terminate unexpectedly.
- **Patched Output**: After applying the patch, the program raises a `ValueError` with an informative message indicating that no finite values are found. While this is a more expected and descriptive error, it does not resolve the original goal (allowing plotting with `np.nan` values), as the code still fails to complete the operation successfully.

The patch improves error handling by making it clear why the operation fails (i.e., there are no finite values to work with), but it does not resolve the issue of the `ax.bar` function failing with all `np.nan` inputs. Therefore, the issue remains unresolved concerning the plot functionality itself.

Issue resolved: `False`

To resolve this issue, I need to examine the current implementation of the `use_required_attribute` method in both the `ClearableFileInput` and `FileInput` classes. This will help me understand the existing logic and ensure that any modifications follow the intended design while maintaining functionality.

First, I'll locate and review the `use_required_attribute` method in the `ClearableFileInput` class, which is likely located in the `django/forms/widgets.py` file as hinted by the issue description. Afterward, I will check for the `FileInput` class implementation to see where this method resides and how it can be adjusted. 

Let's search for these methods in the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute")
search_method_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "FileInput.use_required_attribute")
search_class_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "FileInput")
```

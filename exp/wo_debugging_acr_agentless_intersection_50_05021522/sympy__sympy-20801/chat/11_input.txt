## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
S(0.0) == S.false returns True
This issue is related to those listed in #20033. 

As shown by @sayandip18, comparing `S.false` to `S(0.0)` returns 2 different results depending on the order in which they are compared:

```pycon
>>> from sympy import *
>>> S(0.0) == S.false
True
>>> S.false == S(0.0)
False
```
Based on the results of comparison to `S(0)`:

```pycon
>>> S(0) == S.false
False
>>> S.false == S(0)
False
```
I assume we would want `S(0.0) == S.false` to return True as well?

==================================================
Your Output:
To address the issue, we need to investigate how the equality comparison is implemented in the `sympy` library, particularly for handling special singleton instances like `S.false` and numerical representations like `S(0.0)`. Given the problem is related to object comparisons, I likely need to examine the implementation of the equality operator for these specific objects. 

Therefore, I will search for relevant methods or classes related to this behavior. 

```python
search_class_in_codebase("S")
search_method_in_codebase("__eq__")
search_method_in_codebase("_sympy_")
```
I will start by checking the `S` class or similar classes and their `__eq__` methods which handle such equality checks. The `_sympy_` method might also be relevant as it is typically used in sympy to decide the representation of objects for comparison operations.

==================================================

Your Output:
The `__eq__` methods play a crucial role in determining the equality checks across various sympy classes. To understand how the equality comparison is currently being handled between `S(0.0)` and `S.false`, I need to verify the implementation of the `S(0.0)` and `S.false`.

Particularly, I need to check how `S.false` is represented and how comparisons are being evaluated between `Boolean` objects and `Numbers`, usually involving singleton instances for `True`, `False`, and numbers, drawing from sympy's symbolic representation.

From the API invoke result, I can see various implementations of `__eq__` methods, including those directly related to basic symbolic types and expressions. Examining these methods further can help ascertain how `S(0.0)` comparisons are processed.

I need to retrieve the source code for the `S` object since understanding its representation can provide insights on whether `S.false` should be equated with `S(0.0)` under current sympy paradigms. Let's find the relevant source code for the `S` class to proceed further.

==================================================

Your Output:
To address the issue, we need to modify the equality comparison so that `S(0.0) == S.false` returns `False`. We've gathered the existing __eq__ logic for Float and Boolean types, which indicate that Floats are not equal to Boolean values. However, due to the behavior observed (`S(0.0) == S.false` returning `True`), it seems likely that `_sympify` is involved in converting these objects, and additional checks in the `__eq__` method of either Float or Boolean types are needed to correctly handle such comparisons.

To generate the patch, I need the full source code for the `BooleanAtom.__eq__` method in `sympy/core/logic.py`. Since the __eq__ method is part of the logic class hierarchy, further investigation may be required to understand how comparisons between floats and booleans are handled. Thus I will retrieve the source code for the `sympy/core/logic.py` file to ensure I have the complete context for these comparisons.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Float
    >>> Float(3.5)
    3.50000000000000
    >>> Float(3)
    3.00000000000000

    Creating Floats from strings (and Python ``int`` and ``long``
    types) will give a minimum precision of 15 digits, but the
    precision will automatically increase to capture all digits
    entered.

    >>> Float(1)
    1.00000000000000
    >>> Float(10**20)
    100000000000000000000.
    >>> Float('1e20')
    100000000000000000000.

    However, *floating-point* numbers (Python ``float`` types) retain
    only 15 digits of precision:

    >>> Float(1e20)
    1.00000000000000e+20
    >>> Float(1.23456789123456789)
    1.23456789123457

    It may be preferable to enter high-precision decimal numbers
    as strings:

    >>> Float('1.23456789123456789')
    1.23456789123456789

    The desired number of digits can also be specified:

    >>> Float('1e-3', 3)
    0.00100
    >>> Float(100, 4)
    100.0

    Float can automatically count significant figures if a null string
    is sent for the precision; spaces or underscores are also allowed. (Auto-
    counting is only allowed for strings, ints and longs).

    >>> Float('123 456 789.123_456', '')
    123456789.123456
    >>> Float('12e-3', '')
    0.012
    >>> Float(3, '')
    3.

    If a number is written in scientific notation, only the digits before the
    exponent are considered significant if a decimal appears, otherwise the
    "e" signifies only how to move the decimal:

    >>> Float('60.e2', '')  # 2 digits significant
    6.0e+3
    >>> Float('60e2', '')  # 4 digits significant
    6000.
    >>> Float('600e-2', '')  # 3 digits significant
    6.00

    Notes
    =====

    Floats are inexact by their nature unless their value is a binary-exact
    value.

    >>> approx, exact = Float(.1, 1), Float(.125, 1)

    For calculation purposes, evalf needs to be able to change the precision
    but this will not increase the accuracy of the inexact value. The
    following is the most accurate 5-digit approximation of a value of 0.1
    that had only 1 digit of precision:

    >>> approx.evalf(5)
    0.099609

    By contrast, 0.125 is exact in binary (as it is in base 10) and so it
    can be passed to Float or evalf to obtain an arbitrary precision with
    matching accuracy:

    >>> Float(exact, 5)
    0.12500
    >>> exact.evalf(20)
    0.12500000000000000000

    Trying to make a high-precision Float from a float is not disallowed,
    but one must keep in mind that the *underlying float* (not the apparent
    decimal value) is being obtained with high precision. For example, 0.3
    does not have a finite binary representation. The closest rational is
    the fraction 5404319552844595/2**54. So if you try to obtain a Float of
    0.3 to 20 digits of precision you will not see the same thing as 0.3
    followed by 19 zeros:

    >>> Float(0.3, 20)
    0.29999999999999998890

    If you want a 20-digit value of the decimal 0.3 (not the floating point
    approximation of 0.3) you should send the 0.3 as a string. The underlying
    representation is still binary but a higher precision than Python's float
    is used:

    >>> Float('0.3', 20)
    0.30000000000000000000

    Although you can increase the precision of an existing Float using Float
    it will not increase the accuracy -- the underlying value is not changed:

    >>> def show(f): # binary rep of Float
    ...     from sympy import Mul, Pow
    ...     s, m, e, b = f._mpf_
    ...     v = Mul(int(m), Pow(2, int(e), evaluate=False), evaluate=False)
    ...     print('%s at prec=%s' % (v, f._prec))
    ...
    >>> t = Float('0.3', 3)
    >>> show(t)
    4915/2**14 at prec=13
    >>> show(Float(t, 20)) # higher prec, not higher accuracy
    4915/2**14 at prec=70
    >>> show(Float(t, 2)) # lower prec
    307/2**10 at prec=10

    The same thing happens when evalf is used on a Float:

    >>> show(t.evalf(20))
    4915/2**14 at prec=70
    >>> show(t.evalf(2))
    307/2**10 at prec=10

    Finally, Floats can be instantiated with an mpf tuple (n, c, p) to
    produce the number (-1)**n*c*2**p:

    >>> n, c, p = 1, 5, 0
    >>> (-1)**n*c*2**p
    -5
    >>> Float((1, 5, 0))
    -5.00000000000000

    An actual mpf tuple also contains the number of bits in c as the last
    element of the tuple:

    >>> _._mpf_
    (1, 5, 0, 3)

    This is not needed for instantiation and is not the same thing as the
    precision. The mpf tuple and the precision are two separate quantities
    that Float tracks.

    In SymPy, a Float is a number that can be computed with arbitrary
    precision. Although floating point 'inf' and 'nan' are not such
    numbers, Float can create these numbers:

    >>> Float('-inf')
    -oo
    >>> _.is_Float
    False

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

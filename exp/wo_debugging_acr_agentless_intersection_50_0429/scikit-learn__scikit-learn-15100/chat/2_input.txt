#### Description
<!-- Example: Joblib Error thrown when calling fit on LatentDirichletAllocation with evaluate_every > 0-->

The `strip_accents="unicode"` feature of `CountVectorizer` and related does not work as expected when it processes strings that contain accents, if those strings are already in NFKD form.

#### Steps/Code to Reproduce

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import strip_accents_unicode

# This string contains one code point, "LATIN SMALL LETTER N WITH TILDE"
s1 = chr(241)

# This string contains two code points, "LATIN SMALL LETTER N" followed by "COMBINING TILDE"
s2 = chr(110) + chr(771)

# They are visually identical, as expected
print(s1) # => ñ
print(s2) # => ñ

# The tilde is removed from s1, as expected
print(strip_accents_unicode(s1)) # => n

# But strip_accents_unicode returns s2 unchanged
print(strip_accents_unicode(s2) == s2) # => True
```

#### Expected Results

`s1` and `s2` should both be normalized to the same string, `"n"`.

#### Actual Results
`s2` is not changed, because `strip_accent_unicode` does nothing if the string is already in NFKD form.

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue with the `strip_accents_unicode` function, I need to retrieve its source code first. This will allow me to examine how it handles the string normalization and identify the part where it's failing to strip accents from strings in NFKD form.

As I don't have the file path for this method, I'll search the method in the whole project codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("strip_accents_unicode")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("strip_accents_unicode")
RESULT:
#### sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py:strip_accents_unicode
```python
def strip_accents_unicode(s):
    """Transform accentuated unicode symbols into their simple counterpart

    Warning: the python-level loop and join operations make this
    implementation 20 times slower than the strip_accents_ascii basic
    normalization.

    Parameters
    ----------
    s : string
        The string to strip

    See also
    --------
    strip_accents_ascii
        Remove accentuated char for any unicode symbol that has a direct
        ASCII equivalent.
    """
    normalized = unicodedata.normalize('NFKD', s)
    if normalized == s:
        return s
    else:
        return ''.join([c for c in normalized if not unicodedata.combining(c)])

```


==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

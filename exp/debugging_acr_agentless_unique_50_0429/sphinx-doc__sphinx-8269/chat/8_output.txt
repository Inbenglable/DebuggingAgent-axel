The patch provided introduces a new function `process_linkcheck_result`, which is meant to handle both HTTP status codes and anchor checks. This function is expected to report HTTP errors like 404 and 500 with the appropriate status message when `linkcheck_anchors` is set to `True`. This change appears to be a reasonable approach to address the issue described.

However, from both the original and patched outputs, the error shown is a `FileNotFoundError`, indicating the directory structure required for the test setup isn’t present or created correctly before running the script. This error occurs when trying to open the `conf.py`, and it is unrelated to the logic changed by the patch.

The crucial problem here is the test setup itself is failing due to missing directories. Therefore, the test code cannot verify if the logic change is correct or not, as it's unable to proceed past the directory setup phase.

Given that the test failure hasn’t changed post-patch, the current evidence doesn't allow us to determine if the logic to handle HTTP errors has been adequately addressed by the patch.

Therefore, unless the directory creation issue is resolved, we cannot ascertain if the issue with `linkcheck` is resolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

### Patch Review

The proposed patch modifies the `sklearn/feature_selection/_sequential.py` file. Specifically, it changes the `_get_best_new_feature_score` method by converting the `cv` parameter into a list when it is being passed to the `cross_val_score` function. This change is intended to prevent the exhaustion of a generator when `cv` is an iterable of splits. The relevant part of the code has been changed from:

```python
cv=self.cv,
```

to:

```python
cv=list(self.cv),
```

### Analysis of Test Output

#### Original Output

Before applying the patch, the provided testing script results in an `IndexError` due to a "list index out of range" issue. This error originates when trying to access elements in an empty list, which arises if the iterable of splits passed to `cv` is exhausted.

#### Patched Output

After applying the patch, running the test script still results in the same `IndexError`. The error indicates that the issue remains unaddressed, as the outputs of the tests before and after applying the patch are identical.

### Conclusion

The patch does not solve the problem. The `IndexError` persists in the patched output, demonstrating that converting the iterable of splits to a list does not remedy the bug as expected. Therefore:

Issue resolved: `False`

To resolve this issue, a patch needs to be applied to ensure the `subs()` function correctly handles expressions involving hyperbolic functions and piecewise conditions with real assumptions. I'll modify the `_eval_subs` method in the `Piecewise` class located in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`, focusing on improving how substitutions are performed under assumptions.

Here is the patch:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        c = c._subs(old, new)\n=======\n        c = c.subs(old, new)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                e = e._subs(old, new)\n=======\n                e = e.subs(old, new)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

Explanation:
- Replace `_subs` with `subs` to make use of the public substitution method, which might include additional handling for assumptions or specific expression types, helping prevent errors like `PolynomialError`.
- This adjustment aims to improve compatibility with expressions using hyperbolic functions and piecewise components under real assumptions, resolving the issue without disrupting existing functionality.

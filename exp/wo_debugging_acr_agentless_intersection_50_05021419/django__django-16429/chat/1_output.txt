To resolve the issue at hand, I need to first examine the source code of the `timesince` function. This function is likely involved in the problematic code where the `TypeError` occurs, and I need to verify how it handles timezone-aware and timezone-naive datetimes.

I'll start by retrieving the source code for the `timesince` function in the Django project.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("timesince")
```

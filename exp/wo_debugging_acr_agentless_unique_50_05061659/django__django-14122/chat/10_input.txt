## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Meta.ordering fields must not be included in GROUP BY clause
Description
	
This continues (closed) [1] ticket.
I beleave it was not properly fixed in commit [0ddb4ebf].
While commit [0ddb4ebf] removes ORDER BY when Meta.ordering is used it still does populates GROUP BY with Meta.ordering fields thus leads to wrong aggregation.
PR with test case was added at [2].

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To address the issue described, I need to inspect the relevant code handling the ordering and grouping behavior in Django queries. This typically involves the QuerySet and SQL compiler modules. Since I need to inspect how the Meta.ordering fields are included in the GROUP BY clause, it's essential to examine the parts of the codebase responsible for query compilation. Specifically, I'll look at how Django processes ordering fields in QuerySets and compiles SQL statements.

I'll start by searching for classes and methods related to compiling SQL queries because they would include the logic where ordering might unintentionally affect GROUP BY clauses.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("compile")
search_class_in_codebase("SQLCompiler")
search_method_in_codebase("get_ordering")

==================================================

Your Output:
Based on the issue description, we need to address how `Meta.ordering` fields are incorrectly included in the `GROUP BY` clause by examining the methods related to query compilation within the `SQLCompiler` class. Specifically, the `get_group_by` method appears relevant for addressing the issue of inappropriate fields being included in the `GROUP BY` clause. We need to retrieve the source code for this method to understand how it's constructed and identify where corrections should be made.

==================================================

Your Output:
To address the issue of `Meta.ordering` fields being incorrectly included in the `GROUP BY` clause, the next step is to understand how the `order_by` parameter is being processed within the `get_group_by` method and make necessary changes. I have already retrieved the source code for `SQLCompiler.get_group_by`. Now, before generating the patch, I should confirm the functionality of related methods that might influence `order_by` handling, especially those that might transform or affect `Meta.ordering` handling within the execution flow leading to `get_group_by`.

The relevant method looks to be `get_order_by`, which may have logic determining how ordering fields are ultimately used in query compilation. Thus, I should obtain the code for `SQLCompiler.get_order_by` next.

            without_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql)[1]
            params_hash = make_hashable(params)
            if (without_ordering, params_hash) in seen:
                continue
            seen.add((without_ordering, params_hash))
            result.append((resolved, (sql, params, is_ref)))
        return result

```


==================================================

Your Output:
Based on the gathered information, I have a sufficient understanding of the `SQLCompiler.get_group_by` and `SQLCompiler.get_order_by` methods, which are key to addressing the issue with `Meta.ordering` fields being incorrectly included in the `GROUP BY` clause. 

The next step involves adjusting how `order_by` is processed in the `get_group_by` method to ensure `Meta.ordering` does not unconsciously affect `GROUP BY` clauses.

Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

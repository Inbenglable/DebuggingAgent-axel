Analyzing the issue described, the problem lies within the logic of the `show_save_as_new` context variable in the Django admin template tags. Specifically, it needs additional permission verification to ensure that "Save as new" is only shown when the user has both change and add permissions. The test output indicates a failure when the user doesn't have add permission, yet "Save as new" is still made availableâ€”demonstrating the missing permission check.

Looking at the traceback and the observed code, the relevant logic is in the `submit_row` method within the `django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py` file, which constructs the context for the admin change form submit buttons.

The main observation point is at line 102:

```python
"show_save_as_new": not is_popup
    and has_change_permission
    and change
    and save_as,
```

The test script suggests, and correctly so, that `has_add_permission` should be added to the `show_save_as_new` condition to prevent it from appearing if the user lacks add permission.

Thus, the analysis suggests that the buggy method is indeed the one controlling this logic. 

Buggy method: `django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py:submit_row`

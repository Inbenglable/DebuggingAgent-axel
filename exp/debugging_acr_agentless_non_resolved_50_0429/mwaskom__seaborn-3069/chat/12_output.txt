To address the issue of properly drawing nominal scales in the Seaborn library's `_finalize_figure` method, here's the patch that we'll apply. The changes involve handling nominal scales similarly to categorical ones regarding axis limits and potentially other properties that help mirror the functionalities intended for categorical plots.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### seaborn/_core/plot.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nif isinstance(a, str):\n    lo = cast(float, lo) - 0.5\nif isinstance(b, str):\n    hi = cast(float, hi) + 0.5\n=======\n# Extend the limits by 0.5 for nominal scales to align behavior with categorical scales\ndef is_nominal(value):\n    return isinstance(value, (str, Nominal))\n\nif is_nominal(a):\n    lo = cast(float, lo) - 0.5\nif is_nominal(b):\n    hi = cast(float, hi) + 0.5\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Condition Checking:** Added a helper function `is_nominal` to check against `Nominal` types as well (assuming an appropriate `Nominal` identifier).
- **Composite Handling:** Adjusting limits based on whether the scale represents a nominal type through the helper, which can contribute to addressing both explicitly defined and inferred nominal types. This change allows tick range expansion as expected.

This patch ensures that nominal scales will receive the same tick positioning as categorical scales, providing the intended behavior by applying a consistent offset for tick marks.

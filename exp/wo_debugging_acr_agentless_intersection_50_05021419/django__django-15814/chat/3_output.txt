To generate a patch for this issue, I need to retrieve the full context of the portion of the code in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` where the change is required. Specifically, I need to identify the relevant method in which this code snippet resides to understand how `_meta` is utilized and to correctly implement the change to `_meta.concrete_model._meta`.

I'll search for the surrounding method in this file to ensure I have complete information.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/sql/query.py", "cur_model = source.related_model")
```

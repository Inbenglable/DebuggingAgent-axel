Here is the patch to resolve the issue with the `_cstack` function in `astropy/modeling/separable.py` to correctly handle the computation of the separability matrix for nested compound models:

```python
### astropy/modeling/separable.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    cright = np.zeros((noutp, right.shape[1]))
    cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = 1
=======
    cright = np.zeros((noutp, right.shape[1]))
    cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = right
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This patch ensures that the `cright` matrix, which represents the separability information of the right component in a compound model, correctly reflects the actual separability matrix of the right model instead of using ones, thereby maintaining the expected separability in nested models.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### astropy/modeling/separable.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    cright = np.zeros((noutp, right.shape[1]))\n    cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = 1\n=======\n    cright = np.zeros((noutp, right.shape[1]))\n    cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = right\n>>>>>>> REPLACE"
  ]
}
```

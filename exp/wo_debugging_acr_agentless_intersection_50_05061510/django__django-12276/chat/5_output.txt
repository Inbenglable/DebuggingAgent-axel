To resolve the issue stated, we need to modify the `use_required_attribute` method in the `FileInput` class so that it doesn't display the `required` attribute when initial data exists. We'll move the current logic that exists in `ClearableFileInput` to the `FileInput` class because `ClearableFileInput` inherits from `FileInput` and simply calls the superclass's `use_required_attribute`.

Let's proceed with the necessary patch:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/forms/widgets.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    def use_required_attribute(self, initial):\n        return not self.is_hidden\n=======\n    def use_required_attribute(self, initial):\n        return not self.is_hidden and not initial\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch updates the `use_required_attribute` method of the `FileInput` class to consider the `initial` parameter, preventing the `required` attribute from being rendered if initial data is provided. This adjustment aligns with the desired behavior without altering the existing functionality when no initial data is present.

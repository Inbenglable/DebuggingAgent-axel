### Patch Review

The given patch modifies the `merge_setting` function specifically for headers management in `requests/sessions.py`. The approach filters out headers where the value is `None` from the final headers dictionary used to prepare a request. This aligns with the expected behavior where setting a session header to `None` should omit it from being sent, instead of attaching "None" as the header value. 

### Test Output Analysis

- **Original Output**: The test originally raises a TypeError indicating an attempt to use "None" as a header value, which Python's `http.client` library rejects as a non-string or non-byte object.

- **Patched Output**: The patched output shows that the `Accept-Encoding` header is set to `identity`, which is a common response fallback option when no encoding is specified. This means the header "Accept-Encoding: None" is not sent, resolving the immediate problem described in the issue.

### Conclusion

The patch effectively prevents headers with `None` values from being sent by the `requests` library, thus resolving the bug where "None" was incorrectly used as the value of a header. Given the patched output successfully omits any "None" value headers, the issue is resolved.

Issue resolved: `True`

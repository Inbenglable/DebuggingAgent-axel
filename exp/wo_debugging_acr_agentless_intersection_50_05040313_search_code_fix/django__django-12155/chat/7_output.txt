To resolve the issue, we need to modify the `trim_docstring` function in the `django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py` file. The issue arises because the indentation computation incorrectly includes the first line of the docstring. As suggested, we will adjust the code to skip the first line during indentation calculation.

Here's the search/replace patch:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())\n=======\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch ensures that indentation calculation starts from the second line of the docstring, which resolves the issue described.

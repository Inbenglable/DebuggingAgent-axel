To address the issue where `hist()` does not properly respect the `range` parameter when `density=True`, we need to ensure that the range is enforced in the histogram computation, and that the bins are properly created within this range. This involves making sure that when `density=True`, the normalization factor accounts for the specified range.

Let's focus on the part of the code handling density and range settings in the `hist()` method located in `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py`.

We need to ensure that:
- The bin range is set correctly during the histogram calculation when `density=True`.

Here's a patch to achieve that:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            hist_kwargs = dict(density=density)\n=======\n            hist_kwargs = dict(density=density, range=bin_range)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation

- **Location**: This edit is done in the section of the `hist()` method where histogram options are being prepared before the calculation. We ensure that `range=bin_range` is passed to `np.histogram` when `density=True`, making sure that the range specified by the user is enforced.
  
This change should fix the bug by making sure that the computation of the histogram uses the correct range, and that the bins reflect the user's request to have them within a specific range, even when `density=True`.

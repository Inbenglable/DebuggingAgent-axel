Based on the API invocation, we received two results related to the `hexbin` function:

1. **lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py:hexbin** - This is likely the higher-level interface for the `hexbin` method, which simply delegates the call to an `Axes` object to perform the actual plotting. The internal logic of how `mincnt` and `C` are handled is probably not implemented here.

2. **lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py:Axes.hexbin** - This appears to be the implementation of the `hexbin` plotting functionality within the `Axes` class. It deals directly with parameters such as `C` and `mincnt`, and contains logic for processing those inputs. This is likely where the main bug resides.

For the purpose of diagnosing and fixing the issue with the `mincnt` parameter, the file **lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py:Axes.hexbin** is essential because it contains the detailed logic for handling the parameters, including any conditional statements that might lead to the discrepancies noted in the bug report.

Therefore, the relevant content is:

```
lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py:Axes.hexbin
```

Based on the issue description and the test failure output, the problem lies in the `srepr` method not correctly handling `set` and `dict` types in the `sympy` library. The test clearly indicates that the expected output for a set should be represented as `FiniteSet(Symbol('x'), Symbol('y'))`, and for a dict as `Dict(Symbol('x'), Symbol('y'))`, but instead, it simply outputs `{y, x}` and `{x: y}` respectively. The printing of the set and dict directly using their Python representations instead of SymPy's internal representations is incorrect according to the test expectations.

In the provided output, we see that `srepr` is a function within the file `sympy/printing/repr.py`. This function calls `ReprPrinter(settings).doprint(expr)`, which indicates that the printing is being done by the `doprint` method of the `ReprPrinter` class. Hence, the abnormal behavior is likely due to this method failing to detect sets and dicts and pass them to appropriate handler methods, which should convert them into `FiniteSet` and `Dict`.

We should start by inspecting the `doprint` method in the `ReprPrinter` class to trace how it processes different types of input. This will help us determine why it is handling sets and dicts improperly.

Observed method: `sympy/printing/printer.py:ReprPrinter.doprint`

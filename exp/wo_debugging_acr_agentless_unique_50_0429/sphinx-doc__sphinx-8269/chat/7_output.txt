Based on the search results, the functions named `check` in `tests/test_domain_cpp.py` and `tests/test_domain_c.py` are likely related to testing certain characteristics of inputs for C and C++ domain features in Sphinx, given the context of those test files. These functions do not seem to be directly related to the functionality dealing with link checking or handling HTTP status codes as described in the issue.

Since we are focusing on the functionality of the `linkcheck` command as it relates to HTTP status codes and anchor checking, the above search results do not appear relevant. They belong to test files for specific domains (C and C++) and are unlikely to have anything to do with the link checking mechanism used by Sphinx.

Therefore, none of the returned contents are directly related to the current issue of `linkcheck` command functionality.

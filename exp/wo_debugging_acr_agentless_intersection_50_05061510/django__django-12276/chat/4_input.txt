You are a PR reviewer that needs to review the patch generated by a bug repair agent and determine whether the issue is fixed or not.
This is the bug issue, which is in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
FileInput shouldn't display required attribute when initial data exists.
Description
	 
		(last modified by thenewguy)
	 
I think that ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute() (â€‹https://github.com/django/django/blob/e703b93a656b78b9b444bb3a9980e305ed002a70/django/forms/widgets.py#L454) should be moved to FileInput.use_required_attribute() so that required is not output on the html input element that represents FileInput when a file is already set (e.g. already saved on a model instance that is being edited).
Maybe I am overlooking a use case where this is not desirable? I can not think of one.

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
## REPRODUCE TEST
```
import traceback
import sys
from django import forms
from django.forms.widgets import FileInput
from django.test import TestCase
from django.conf import settings
from django.test.utils import setup_test_environment, teardown_test_environment
from django.test.runner import DiscoverRunner

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

class FileInputForm(forms.Form):
    file_field = forms.FileField(widget=FileInput)

class FileInputTest(TestCase):
    def test_file_input_required_attribute(self):
        # Create a form instance with initial data
        form = FileInputForm(initial={'file_field': 'initial_file.txt'})
        # Render the form to HTML
        html_output = form.as_p()
        # Check if the 'required' attribute is in the HTML output
        if 'required' in html_output:
            e = AssertionError("The 'required' attribute is present in the FileInput widget when initial data exists.")
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise e

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Set up minimal Django settings
    settings.configure(
        DEBUG=True,
        INSTALLED_APPS=[
            'django.contrib.contenttypes',
            'django.contrib.auth',
        ],
        DATABASES={
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': ':memory:'
            }
        },
        ROOT_URLCONF=__name__,
        SECRET_KEY='fake-key',
    )
    # Set up the test environment
    setup_test_environment()
    # Run the test
    runner = DiscoverRunner()
    failures = runner.run_tests(['reproducer'])
    # Teardown the test environment
    teardown_test_environment()
    # Exit with the appropriate code
    sys.exit(bool(failures))
```

And this is the original output when running the test (before applying the patch):
## ORIGINAL OUTPUT

    "setup_test_environment() was already called and can't be called "
RuntimeError: setup_test_environment() was already called and can't be called again without first calling teardown_test_environment().

```

The repair agent has tried to generate a patch to fix the issue:
## PATCH CONTEXT
<PATCH_CONTEXT>
To resolve the issue of the `required` attribute being displayed when initial data exists, we need to modify the `use_required_attribute` method in the `FileInput` class so that it mirrors the behavior from the `ClearableFileInput` class. Here are the details for creating a patch:

### Planning:
1. **Identify the Target Method**: The `use_required_attribute` method in the `ClearableFileInput` class checks if the initial data exists and prevents the `required` attribute if it does.
2. **Apply the Logic to `FileInput`**: The logic should be transferred to the `FileInput` class, overriding the base behavior from `Widget`, which only considers if the widget is hidden.

### Patch Creation:
We'll patch the `FileInput` method `use_required_attribute` to include the check for initial data presence.

```pythony
### django/forms/widgets.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def use_required_attribute(self, initial):
        return not self.is_hidden
=======
    def use_required_attribute(self, initial):
        return not self.is_hidden and not initial
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### Final JSON Output:
Create the JSON structured result which contains the search/replace patch edit:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/forms/widgets.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    def use_required_attribute(self, initial):\n        return not self.is_hidden\n=======\n    def use_required_attribute(self, initial):\n        return not self.is_hidden and not initial\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This edit ensures that the `required` attribute will respect the presence of initial data, directly addressing the issue reported.
</PATCH_CONTEXT>

After applying the patch, the output of the test is:
## PATCHED OUTPUT
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-12276/reproduce.py", line 56, in <module>

    self.setup_test_environment()

    setup_test_environment(debug=self.debug_mode)

    "setup_test_environment() was already called and can't be called "
RuntimeError: setup_test_environment() was already called and can't be called again without first calling teardown_test_environment().

```

Now, please first review the patch and analyse the test output before and after the patch, to determine whether the issue is fixed or not.

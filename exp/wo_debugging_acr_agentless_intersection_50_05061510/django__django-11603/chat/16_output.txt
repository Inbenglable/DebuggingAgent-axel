Let's review the patch and analyze the test output before and after patches to determine whether the issue is resolved:

1. **Patch Context**:
   - The patch modifies the `Avg`, `Sum`, `Min`, and `Max` classes within `django/db/models/aggregates.py` to include `allow_distinct = True`. This change is essential to support DISTINCT functionality in these aggregate classes, allowing them to handle DISTINCT queries properly.

2. **Original Output**:
   - The test raises an `AppRegistryNotReady` exception, indicating a setup issue with the Django apps. Specifically, it points out that "Apps aren't loaded yet." This suggested that the exception is unrelated to whether DISTNCT support is implemented correctly but rather indicates an initial configuration or setup issue with the test.

3. **Patched Output**:
   - The patched output also raises the same `AppRegistryNotReady` exception, indicating consistency in the setup issue rather than the specific bug the patch aimed to address.

Given these points, the patch itself makes the necessary code changes to handle DISTINCT properly in Avg, Sum, Min, and Max aggregates. However, the test's configuration-related issue (i.e., "Apps aren't loaded yet") persists both before and after the patch application, preventing the test from actually evaluating the patch's effectiveness regarding DISTINCT functionality.

Therefore, the issue of allowing DISTINCT in aggregates is not directly tested due to this unrelated setup error, and we cannot ascertain the resolution based solely on the test outputs provided. The test setup needs correction before the patched functionality could be verified.

**Conclusion**:
Issue resolved: `False`

Squashed migration is not marked as unapplied
Description
	 
		(last modified by Markus Holtermann)
	 
When unapplying a squashed migration and the replaced migration files are still around, the MigrationExecutor mark the squash migration as unapplied, too, not only the replaced migrations.

</ISSUE>


A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
To analyze the abnormal program behavior and identify the bug in the Django project related to migration squashing, we need to trace through the code execution.

1. **Issue Description:**
   - The issue pertains to the undoing of a squashed migration, which inadvertently affects the status of the squashed migration itself along with the individual migrations it replaced.
   - The `MigrationExecutor` should be marking the squashed migration as unapplied when one of its replaced migrations is unapplied.

2. **Test Observation:**
   - The test script simulates the application and unappliance of a squashed migration.
   - The test output indicates that after unapplied both original migrations (`0001_initial` and `0002_change`), the squashed migration (`0001_squashed_0002`) remains marked as applied. This behavior is incorrect according to the intended functionality.

3. **Code Execution:**
   - During the execution, when the squashed migration is recorded as applied, it is correctly added to the migration record.
   - However, when one of its replaced migrations is unapplied, the squashed migration's applied status should also be revoked.

   The behavior suggests an issue in the migration graph construction or update mechanism.

To continue the trace and pinpoint the buggy behavior, the next step is to scrutinize the way unapplied migrations affect replacement registrations. Let's inspect the method that's responsible for handling unapplied migrations and graph updates.

**Next Method to Observe:**
Observed method: `django/db/migrations/loader.py:MigrationLoader.build_graph`
==================================================
### Analysis

The behavior observed in the test indicates that after unapplying both the replaced migrations (`0001_initial` and `0002_change`), the squashed migration (`0001_squashed_0002`) still remains marked as applied. The expected behavior is that the squashed migration should be marked as unapplied, since the migrations it was replacing are unapplied.

While analyzing the `MigrationLoader.build_graph` method, which constructs the migration dependency graph, we can see the handling of replacements at lines 237-247. Specifically:

- Lines 241-247 determine the applied status of replacement migrations. If all replacements are applied, the squashed migration is marked as applied. If not, it is removed from the applied migrations.
- Lines 248-256 decide whether a replacing migration should be used based on its replacement targets being all or none applied.

The issue seems to root in how unapplied migrations affect the replacement status. The logic on lines 241-247 needs to thoroughly ensure that whenever one of the replacement migrations is unapplied, the squashed migration should also be marked as unapplied.

Given the information:

### Next Steps

The issue likely requires further investigation of the logic handling the applied status updates based on the replacement migrations. A pertinent scope to observe would be lines handling conditional logic on replacements and their application status.

**Therefore, I would like to deeper observe:**

```python
Observed scope: django/db/migrations/loader.py:241-247
```
==================================================
The abnormal behavior observed in the runtime information confirms that the squashed migration remains marked as applied even after both of its replaced migrations are unapplied. This is inconsistent with the intended behavior, where a squashed migration should be marked as unapplied if any of the migrations it replaced are unapplied.

**Analysis of the Observed Code:**
- The logic at lines 241-247 in `MigrationLoader.build_graph` checks if all migrations listed under the `replaces` attribute of a migration are applied. If all are applied, it marks the squashed migration as applied. 
- The problem arises when one of the replaced migrations is unapplied; the squashed migration should be removed from the `applied_migrations`, but this isn't occurring in the output observed.

Based on the observation and analysis, it seems that the condition to remove the squashed migration from the `applied_migrations` is not executed after unapplying the replaced migrations.

**Identifying the Buggy Method and Code:**
The issue appears to be rooted in the way the `applied_migrations` dictionary is updated. In particular, the logic should also account for situations where a migration that is part of the `replaces` list is unapplied, thus necessitating the unapplication of the squashed migration.

Given the analysis, we have enough information to conclude that the bug is within the handling of unapplied migration updates inside the `build_graph` method. The method fails to remove the applied status of a squashed migration when any of its component migrations become unapplied.

Therefore, the buggy method is:

Your Output:
To address the issue found in the `MigrationLoader.build_graph` method, we need to obtain its source code first. This will allow us to examine the existing logic and propose the necessary changes to fix the problem. Hence, the next step is to retrieve the source code for the `MigrationLoader.build_graph` method to ensure an accurate fix.

==================================================

Your Output:
The source code for the `MigrationLoader.build_graph` method has been retrieved successfully. This should be sufficient to generate a patch, as this method contains the logic that handles migration dependencies and checks which migrations are applied and which are not. 

Given the issue at hand, related to the unapplied status of squashed migrations not updating correctly when their replacement migrations are unapplied, we should have the necessary context from this method to fix the bug.

Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

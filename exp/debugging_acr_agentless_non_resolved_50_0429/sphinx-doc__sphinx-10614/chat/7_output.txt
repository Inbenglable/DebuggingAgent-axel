The current analysis of the `InheritanceGraph.generate_dot` method indicates that the URLs dictionary is unexpectedly empty when the inheritance diagrams are generated, especially when embedded in HTML files located outside the root directory. This suggests that the issue likely originates from an earlier stage in the code execution, where the URLs dictionary should be populated with correct paths for all classes included in the inheritance diagram.

The paths for these classes must be correctly relative to the SVG or its embedding HTML file's location to avoid the 404 errors reported in the issue.

Given this scenario, the logical next step is to examine the method that is responsible for gathering and populating the URLs for each class in the inheritance diagram. This likely involves analyzing an upstream method where the URLs are determined for each class to ensure they consider the current directory context when constructing the URLs.

Therefore, the next step is to trace the method responsible for populating the URLs dictionary.

Observed method: `sphinx/ext/inheritance_diagram.py:InheritanceGraph._import_classes`

To address the issue, I need to understand how the `GaussianMixture` class, specifically the `fit_predict` and `predict` methods are implemented. This will allow me to understand why the methods disagree when `n_init > 1`.

I will start by checking the implementation of `fit_predict` and `predict` methods in the `GaussianMixture` class.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("GaussianMixture")
search_method_in_codebase("GaussianMixture.fit_predict")
search_method_in_codebase("GaussianMixture.predict")
```

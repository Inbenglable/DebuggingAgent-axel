The issue involves modifying the `get_child_arguments()` function in `django/utils/autoreload.py` to detect when `-m` is used for a package other than Django. The retrieved source code of `get_child_arguments()` is already available, and it's sufficient for generating a patch.

The necessary code has been gathered, and I am ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

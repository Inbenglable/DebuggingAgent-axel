Based on the information obtained, the `_print_Add` methods are responsible for handling the printing of addition and subtraction expressions, and they seem to determine how terms are combined into a string representation, including handling negative coefficients. To resolve the issue with the incorrect printing of MatrixSymbols' subtraction, a patch will likely be required within this method.

However, before proceeding with the patch generation, I need to ensure I have the complete code of the `_print_Add` methods specifically for the `LatexPrinter`, `StrPrinter`, and `PrettyPrinter`, as these are the relevant printers mentioned in the issue description. These methods determine how expressions are printed which includes handling subtraction. Let's retrieve these method definitions from their respective files:

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/latex.py", "LatexPrinter._print_Add")
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/str.py", "StrPrinter._print_Add")
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py", "PrettyPrinter._print_Add")
```

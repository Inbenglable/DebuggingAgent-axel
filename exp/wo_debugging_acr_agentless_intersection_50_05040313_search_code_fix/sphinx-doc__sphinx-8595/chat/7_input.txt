autodoc: empty __all__ attribute is ignored
**Describe the bug**
autodoc: empty `__all__` attribute is ignored

**To Reproduce**
```
# example.py
__all__ = []


def foo():
    "docstring"


def bar():
    "docstring"


def baz():
    "docstring"
```
```
# index.rst
.. automodule:: example
   :members:
```

All foo, bar, and baz are shown.

**Expected behavior**
No entries should be shown because `__all__` is empty.

**Your project**
No

**Screenshots**
No

**Environment info**
- OS: Mac
- Python version: 3.9.1
- Sphinx version: HEAD of 3.x
- Sphinx extensions: sphinx.ext.autodoc
- Extra tools: No

**Additional context**
No

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the described issue in the Sphinx project, we need to ensure that an empty `__all__` attribute results in no entries being shown by `automodule`. Currently, the empty `__all__` attribute seems to be ignored, causing all functions to be displayed.

To address this, the patch will likely need to verify whether `__all__` exists and is empty, thereby enforcing that no members are displayed. This behavior would be expected near the logic that processes modules and handles their attributes, within `sphinx.ext.autodoc`.

A good starting point is to explore the code specific to how `autodoc` interprets `__all__`. The general functionality related to `__all__` may reside in modules that handle the extraction and filtering of module-level attributes. Here's how we will proceed:

1. Locate the parts of the code that deal with the processing of a module's `__all__` attribute within the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` extension.
2. Review the current implementation for ignoring an empty `__all__`.
3. Plan for an adjustment in logic to prevent members from being listed if `__all__` is empty.

Given this analysis, the next step is to explore the relevant source code. Here's what I need to search for:

```python
search_method_in_codebase("ModuleScanner.scan")
search_class_in_codebase("ModuleScanner")
```

I'll begin exploring for a typical class and method that handles scanning of modules and potentially modifies behavior based on the presence and contents of `__all__`.

==================================================

Your Output:
I need to retrieve more source code to understand how the `__all__` attribute is processed by the `autodoc` extension of Sphinx. In particular, I need to examine the implementation that handles module member extraction and any existing conditions involving the `__all__` attribute.

I will start by searching for methods in the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` extension that might interact with module attributes, particularly those involving `__all__`.

search_method_in_codebase("process_docstring")

==================================================

Your Output:
To properly address the issue, I need to check the handling of the `__all__` attribute in the context of the `autodoc` module in Sphinx. The method `get_object_members` seems to be related to member extraction and might need modifications to appropriately respect an empty `__all__`.

Therefore, I'll retrieve the complete source code for `get_object_members` from `sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py` to analyze and potentially modify it to respect an empty `__all__`.

search_method_in_file("sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py", "get_object_members")

Your Output:
I'm ready to generate the patch based on the information and source code I've retrieved.

Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

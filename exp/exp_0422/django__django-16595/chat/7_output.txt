To effectively resolve the issue, we need to understand the context of the `AlterField.reduce` method within the file `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py`. I've identified the key method, but I need to analyze its surrounding content in the file to effectively modify it.

```python
search_code_in_file("django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py", "class AlterField")
```

You need to trace the abnormal program to resolve project issues and submit pull requests.
Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Set default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.
Description
	
Hello,
As far as I can see, the ​File Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.
What I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).
The tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.
I found mentions of this issue ​on GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:

        ]
    )

    storage = FileSystemStorage()

    permissions = check_file_permissions(large_file, storage)
    assert permissions == 0o644, f"Expected permissions 0o644, got {oct(permissions)}"

    print("File permissions are as expected (0o644). Issue is fixed.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        sys.exit(0)


This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
The issue observed in the test output concerns the discrepancy in file permissions for uploaded files when using different types of temporary storage. The key problem is that when a `TemporaryUploadedFile` is involved, it results in a file with permissions of `0o600`, whereas the desired permission is `0o644`. This typically stems from the behavior of the Python `tempfile` module, where temporary files receive restricted permissions for security reasons.

To address this issue, we should investigate where the `TemporaryUploadedFile` writes the file to storage and where the file permissions might be set or could be overridden. Based on the information provided, the error is likely associated with how Django's `FileSystemStorage` or possibly the `TemporaryUploadedFile` itself handles file saving.

Current analysis suggests tracing the saving behavior in the `FileSystemStorage.save` method since this is where the file handling operations occur. This method is responsible for managing the storage of files, and potentially where file permissions are applied or need to be adjusted.

Observed method: `django/core/files/storage.py:FileSystemStorage.save`
==================================================


Now you choose downstream method Storage.save to further observe, tracing the abnormal program behavior.
This is the method code:
    38	    def save(self, name, content, max_length=None):
    39	        """
    40	        Save new content to the file specified by name. The content should be
    41	        a proper File object or any Python file-like object, ready to be read
    42	        from the beginning.
    43	        """
    44	        # Get the proper name for the file, as it will actually be saved.
    45	        if name is None:
    46	            name = content.name
    47	
    48	        if not hasattr(content, 'chunks'):
    49	            content = File(content, name)
    50	
    51	        name = self.get_available_name(name, max_length=max_length)
    52	        return self._save(name, content)

You need to trace the abnormal program behavior step by step to identify the root cause of the bug and locate the buggy method that contains the code to be fixed.
Now, please first analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior. 

Then, if you can already locate the buggy method and buggy code, reply with:
Buggy method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Otherwise, continue tracing by telling me the code line scope that you want to deeper observe, we will show you the deeper downstream run-time information of the scope you select. Please reply with:
Observed scope: `{FILE_PATH}:{START_LOC}-{END_LOC}`
Note that {FILE_PATH} refers to the path relative to the repository.

If an expression cannot be denested it should be returned unchanged.
IndexError fixed for sqrtdenest.
Fixes #12420 
Now if the expression can't be **denested**, it will be returned unchanged.

</ISSUE>


A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
The provided issue describes an `IndexError` being raised when the `sqrtdenest` function is invoked with a specific expression. The traceback indicates that the error occurs in the `_split_gcd` function within `sympy/simplify/radsimp.py`.

From the trace, here is what happens:

1. The main method defines an expression involving complex numbers and nested square roots.
2. The `sqrtdenest` method in `sympy/simplify/sqrtdenest.py` is called with this expression.
3. Inside `sqrtdenest`, `expand_mul(sympify(expr))` is executed, expanding and simplifying the expression.
4. The `expr` undergoes denesting attempts using `_sqrtdenest0`, which calls `_sqrtdenest1`.
5. The `_sqrt_match` function in `sympy/simplify/sqrtdenest.py` calls `split_surds`.
6. The `split_surds` function calls `_split_gcd`, and `IndexError: tuple index out of range` is raised when `g = a[0]` is attempted because `a` is empty.

The function `_split_gcd` encounters a situation where the input is not as expected, either because it is improperly handling cases where no GCD is found, or the original input to `split_surds` is leading to this scenario.

Given this reasoning, the error seems to stem from `_split_gcd`. We need to review the behavior in this function to ensure it handles the case where `a` might be empty.

Therefore, the next step is to trace the behavior of `_split_gcd` to examine why `a` is empty at this point.

Observed method: `sympy/simplify/radsimp.py:_split_gcd`
==================================================
Analyzing the provided code for the `_split_gcd` function and the runtime information:

The core idea behind `_split_gcd` is to divide a list of integers `a` into two lists: `a1`, which has a common divisor `g`, and `a2`, whose elements are not divisible by `g`. 

However, from the traceback, it is clear that the `IndexError` occurs because `a[0]` is accessed without checking if `a` is non-empty. This could happen if `_split_gcd` is called with an empty list of integers, leading directly to an `IndexError`.

The next logical step is to check why `_split_gcd` is being called with an empty list. This usually stems from the upstream processing or assumptions within `split_surds` or other related functions. Therefore, understanding the invocation and arguments passed to `_split_gcd` would be crucial.

Given this reasoning, the immediate scope to understand would involve how `_split_gcd` is invoked, particularly focusing on the conditions under which it is called. This likely involves `split_surds` where `_split_gcd` is used.

Therefore, I will need to trace the code from the point where `_split_gcd` is invoked with prepared arguments indicating abnormal behavior. For a deeper understanding, the line range in `radsimp.py` related to the invocation and argument preparation would be pertinent.

Observed scope: `sympy/simplify/radsimp.py:1032-1068`
==================================================
Analyzing the current context:

### Code Analysis

From the `_split_gcd` code snippet, we have a series of utility functions managing numerator and denominator expansion and handling fractions. The focus is on the `split_surds` function.

```python
def split_surds(expr):
    split an expression with terms whose squares are rationals into a sum of terms whose surds squared have gcd equal to g and a sum of terms with surds squared prime with g
```

The `split_surds` function is expected to process expressions and segregate terms based on common divisors of their square terms. The code indicates its reliance on the output of `_split_gcd`, making its behavior dependent on the logic and handling within this method.

In `_split_gcd`, an empty list for `a` will cause an `IndexError` when accessed, specifically at `g = a[0]`, if no proper checks are put in place. Since it is called within `split_surds`, there might be scenarios where the conditions or data preparation before calling `_split_gcd` does not account for all instances, especially when there's no common divisor.

### Runtime Information
The traceback and `AssertionError` seem unrelated, focusing instead on an incorrect setup in `run_debugging_test.py`. Its presence helps emphasize that `_split_gcd` must be robust to handle these cases without assumptions.

Given these points, the issue could be within `split_surds`, specifically concerning the setup or calls to `_split_gcd`.

### Next Steps
While the bug might be within `split_surds`, further understanding requires precision on how it constructs or manipulates data before calling `_split_gcd` and under what circumstances empty data emerges.

Therefore, the next logical step is to observe the complete behavior within `split_surds`, especially scanning its interaction leading to `_split_gcd`.

Observed method: `sympy/simplify/radsimp.py:split_surds`
==================================================
Analyzing the `split_surds` method:

### Code Analysis
The code is designed to decompose an expression into surds (square roots) categorized by a greatest common divisor (gcd). Here's a breakdown:

1. **Initial Setup**: It sorts the arguments of the expression and arranges them in a form (`coeff_muls`) that separates coefficients from surds.
2. **Surds Extraction**: It collects the square of the surds for gcd determination.
3. **GCD Split**: `_split_gcd` is invoked with these squares, segregating surds into `b1` (with a common factor `g`) and `b2` (without `g`).
4. **Refactor**: If `b2` is empty, and `b1` has enough elements, it attempts a further split on `b1` elements divided by `g`.
5. **Surds Classification**: Terms are classified into two lists (`a1v` and `a2v`) based on whether their surds belong to `b1` or not, using the adjusted gcd `g2`.
6. **Final Result**: A tuple containing the final GCD, a sum of factors from `a1v`, and `a2v` is returned.

### Issue Analysis
The problem arises due to improper handling when trying to split the surds based on gcd. If `_split_gcd` ends up with empty results initially, further splits attempt without valid data lead to `IndexError`.

From the runtime trace, and the assertion issue, we must ensure `_split_gcd` and its caller can handle scenarios where input leads to empty divisions, which implies enhancing `split_surds` and `_split_gcd` robustness against empty inputs.

### Next Steps
The focus should be on how `_split_gcd` processes inputs from `split_surds` and implicitly verifies for non-empty data before proceeding. An improvement might necessitate validation or conditional handling in `split_surds`.

Since the bug lies with data expectations leading to errors in `_split_gcd`, and there seem to be no upstream data preparation issues leading directly here, the next step involves examining whether any preliminary checks are missing in the needy segment where `g = a[0]` is attempted without confirming if `a` holds valid data.

I will further explore how the inputs are handled during the call to `_split_gcd`. It's prudent to observe the overall interactions leading up to that point and ensure that `_split_gcd` is resilient to empty inputs.

Observed scope: `sympy/simplify/radsimp.py:1068-1087`
==================================================
Analyzing the `split_surds` code snippet and the runtime information:

### Code Analysis

The `split_surds` method is designed to process expressions by sorting them, separating coefficients and surds, and then determining common divisors among the squares of the surds. Here’s its key functional flow:

1. **Sorting and Separation**:
   - The expression arguments are sorted.
   - Coefficients and surds are separated for each term in the expression.

2. **Surds Processing**:
   - It collects squares of the surds and sorts them.

3. **GCD Determination**:
   - Uses `_split_gcd` to determine a common divisor `g`.

4. **Further Splitting**:
   - If there are no surds in `b2` (the list without a common divisor) and `b1` has more than one surd, it tries to split further based on the common factor.

### Abnormal Program Behavior

The presented stack trace indicates an `AssertionError` linked to incorrect file path handling in the runtime environment but this is distinct from the core IndexError being analyzed within `split_surds`.

Given the context, the most likely issue is inadequate handling when `_split_gcd` is called with results that may lead to empty lists being returned, which should trigger careful management in the `split_surds` flow.

### Next Steps

To determine the exact cause of `IndexError`, specifically in the `_split_gcd` function, I need to understand how it handles the surds post-separation and how empty surds or unhandled cases result in this behavior.

Therefore, I will continue to trace the behavior of `_split_gcd` from where it is invoked. This will aid in verifying the correctness of input handling and the adequacy of conditional checks before attempting operations on the returned results.

Observed method: `sympy/simplify/radsimp.py:_split_gcd`
==================================================
Analyzing the current observed code for `_split_gcd` and the abnormal program behavior:

### Code Analysis of `_split_gcd`

In the `_split_gcd` function:

- It attempts to split a list of integers `a` into two lists, `b1` and `b2`, based on the greatest common divisor (GCD).
- **Initialization**: It starts by assigning `g = a[0]` and placing it in `b1`. This is where the error occurs if `a` is empty.
- **Loop Processing**: For each subsequent integer `x` in `a`, it checks the GCD of `g` and `x`.
  - If the GCD is 1, `x` is placed in `b2` (not sharing a divisor with `g`).
  - Otherwise, `g` is updated to the new GCD and `x` is added to `b1`.

### Runtime Analysis

The runtime information provided shows an `AssertionError` unrelated to the core issue here but happening in a separate environment setup for debugging, indicating file path assertions not satisfied.

### Core Issue

The immediate exception-causing line is the assignment `g = a[0]`, which triggers an `IndexError` when `a` is empty. This indicates that there are missing validation checks within `_split_gcd` or its caller, which should ensure `a` is not empty before proceeding.

### Determination

Since `_split_gcd` can directly trigger an `IndexError` without upstream validation, this seems to be the root cause here.

- **Buggy Code**: The initialization `g = a[0]` without checks.
- **Robustness Needed**: Before accessing `a[0]`, ensure that `a` has elements or handle empty input within `_split_gcd`.

With this understanding, I can confirm the buggy method.

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

To resolve this issue, I need to review the implementation of the `GaussianMixture` class and its methods `fit_predict` and `predict`. Understanding these methods will help determine why `fit_predict` and `predict` yield different results when `n_init > 1`. 

Let's proceed to retrieve the source code for the `GaussianMixture` class and its relevant methods.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("GaussianMixture")
search_method_in_codebase("GaussianMixture.fit_predict")
search_method_in_codebase("GaussianMixture.predict")
```

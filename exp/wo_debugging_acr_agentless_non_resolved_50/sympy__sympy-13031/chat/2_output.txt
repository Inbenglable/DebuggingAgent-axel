To fix the issue, I need to locate and examine the source code of the `reduce` function that is used within the `Matrix.hstack` method. It's important to understand the context and usage of the `row_join` method within the reduction process to ensure proper handling of empty matrices. 

Given that I know the specific file, I will now retrieve the `row_join` method's implementation in the respective file to understand how it affects concatenation when involving empty matrices.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/matrices/matrices.py", "row_join")
```

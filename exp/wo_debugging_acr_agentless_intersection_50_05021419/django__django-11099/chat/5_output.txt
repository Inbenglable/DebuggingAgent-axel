To resolve the issue with username validation allowing trailing newlines, we need to adjust the regex patterns in both the `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` classes. The current issue stems from the use of `$`, which should be replaced with `\Z` for stricter end-of-string matching without allowing trailing newlines.

Here's how we can create a search/replace patch for the `django/contrib/auth/validators.py` file:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/auth/validators.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    regex = r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'\n=======\n    regex = r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/contrib/auth/validators.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    regex = r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'\n=======\n    regex = r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

Explanation:
- Both classes originally used `regex = r'^[\w.@+-]+$'` which allows trailing newlines to match.
- We replace each instance with `regex = r'\A[\w.@+-]+\Z'` to prevent this by strictly matching the whole string position.  

Note: Ensure to format the regular strings properly with the escape character `\\` for search and replace in this format.

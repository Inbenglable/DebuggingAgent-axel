To address the issue, I need to look into the `kernS` function to understand where the variable `kern` should be assigned and why it might be referenced before assignment. This requires fetching the source code of the `kernS` function.

Since the user has given a hint that `kernS` is imported from `sympy.core.sympify`, I should start by locating the definition of `kernS` in that module.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/core/sympify.py", "kernS")
```

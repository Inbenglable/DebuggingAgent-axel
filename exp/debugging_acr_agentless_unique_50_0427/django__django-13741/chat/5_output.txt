The current observed method, `LazySettings._setup`, is functioning to load the settings module pointed to by the environment variable `ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE`. It will throw an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception if the environment variable is not correctly set. The error trace suggests an `AssertionError` due to a missing file path when executing a debugging test, indicating setup issues rather than an issue directly within the method.

The main problem does not seem to stem from the method `LazySettings._setup` itself. Instead, it appears that the settings module (`test_settings`) specified in `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is absent, causing Django initialization to fail.

A potential root cause of the abnormal behavior is in the test setup where settings are configured improperly (missing settings module). Thus, the next step is to focus on this test environment setup rather than the Django code itself.

To proceed correctly:

1. **Ensure `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable points to a valid settings file.**
2. **Verify the settings file existence and basic configuration.**

Since the current method does not directly address these issues, a closer observation on how the settings variable is handled when setting up a test case would be valuable. Given this context, the traceback from the test runner setup could provide insights or code that handles settings configuration.

Thus, the next method to observe should focus on test setup or configuration verification:

Observed method: `run_debugging_test.py:debugging_test_execution_wrapper`

To resolve the issue, I need to understand the context in which `_delete_composed_index` is used. Specifically, I need to know how migrations handle constraints like `unique_together` and `index_together`. This could involve looking at the migration operations related to indexes and constraints.

Since the error seems related to the number of constraints detected, it might be useful to inspect the `_constraint_names` method, as it is directly involved in fetching constraint names. Additionally, reviewing the logic around `unique_together` and `index_together` might be useful.

Let's begin retrieving the source code of `_constraint_names` and examine how constraints are managed in the migrations.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "_constraint_names")
search_code_in_file("django/db/migrations/operations/models.py", "index_together")
search_code_in_file("django/db/migrations/operations/models.py", "unique_together")
```

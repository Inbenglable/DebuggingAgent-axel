To resolve the issue, I need to inspect the `__init__` method of the `InheritDocstrings` class. This method is likely where the logic related to inspecting docstrings using `inspect.isfunction` is implemented. I will retrieve the source code for this method to examine how it processes docstrings.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/utils/misc.py", "InheritDocstrings.__init__")
```

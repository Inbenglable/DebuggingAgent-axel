The current analysis demonstrates that the test execution encounters an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception primarily due to the absence of the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable. In the `LazySettings.__getattr__` method, the attempt to access the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting results in an error because the settings have not been adequately initialized. 

This clearly indicates improper setup or configuration as part of the test script, which prevents any further execution until the setup issue is resolved. The missing setup logic hampers the ability to test auto-created ManyToMany fields permissions, as the preparation of the Django environment fails prematurely.

### Summary:
The observed code demonstrates an initialization problem. Before accessing components like `INSTALLED_APPS`, the setup must ensure the Django settings module is properly defined and initialized. The current error pinpointing `LazySettings._setup` indicates the environment setup point that has failed. Therefore, the bug related to ManyToMany field permissions is inaccessible until the initialization issue is resolved.

### Decision:
To proceed effectively, I need to trace back further into how settings are intended to be initialized or where the setup fails to occur before accessing settings-dependent Django components.

### Selected for deeper inspection of settings setup:
Observed method: `django/conf/__init__.py:_setup`

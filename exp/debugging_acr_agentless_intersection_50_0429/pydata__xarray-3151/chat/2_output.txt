The problem, as described, arises when attempting to use the `combine_by_coords` function from the xarray library while providing datasets with non-monotonic identical coordinate values. The expectation is that `combine_by_coords` should handle these cases without error if the coordinate dimensions are indeed identical; however, it currently raises a `ValueError` due to non-monotonicity. 

To address the issue, we need to understand how `combine_by_coords` processes coordinate data, specifically focusing on why it checks for monotonicity in potentially identical coordinates and why this behavior results in a `ValueError`. Given that the error is about monotonic global indexes, it indicates that there is a validation step where coordinates are expected to be monotonic.

Since the error is occurring inside `combine_by_coords`, we should begin by observing this method.

Observed method: `xarray/core/merge.py:combine_by_coords`

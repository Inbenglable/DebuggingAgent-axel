Analyzing the issue, we have an `UnboundLocalError` because the variable `kern` is being referenced in the expression `hit = kern in s` without being previously assigned a value. The offending line is line 516 in `sympy/core/sympify.py`, inside the `kernS` function. The traceback indicates this is the first point where the variable `kern` is referenced, suggesting it wasn't initialized earlier in the function. 

To find a resolution, we need to understand where `kern` should be defined and how it influences the logic in this function. This would involve understanding the intended behavior of `kernS` and the role of `kern` in this context.

Based on the information from the environment and observed code flow, it is reasonable to assume the `kernS` function was meant to initialize `kern` somewhere before its use.

Buggy method: `sympy/core/sympify.py:kernS`

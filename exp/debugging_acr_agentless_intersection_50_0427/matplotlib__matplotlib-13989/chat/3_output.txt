Based on the trace information, we can see that the bug is occurring because the `hist` function in `matplotlib.pyplot` does not generate bins that correctly respect the specified range when called with `density=True`. The provided line of code from `pyplot.py` shows that the `hist` method in `pyplot.py` is essentially forwarding its parameters (including `range` and `density`) to `gca().hist`.

The issue likely occurs in the deeper implementations of the histogram creation, which involves calculating the bins based on the data and the `range` and the `density` flag. These calculations are likely occurring deeper down in the `Axes` class.

To better understand this issue, we should examine the implementation of `gca().hist` further. `gca()` returns the current Axes object, and `Axes.hist` is the method that would handle the actual logic of the histogram plotting.

Observed scope: `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py:675-695` 

(Note: This scope assumes that the `hist` function in `Axes` is near its typical location; this may need adjustment depending on the version.)

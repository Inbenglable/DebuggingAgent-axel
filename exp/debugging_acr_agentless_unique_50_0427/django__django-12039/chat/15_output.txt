Reviewing the information provided:

1. **Issue Description**: The problem revolves around improper whitespace in the SQL generation for `CREATE INDEX` statements. Specifically, there should be a space between the column name and its options (like `DESC` or opclasses). The issue is identified with the method `django.db.backends.ddl_references.Columns`.

2. **Patch Description**: The patch modifies the `Columns` class within `django/db/backends/ddl_references.py`, ensuring that a space is always inserted between the column name and its suffix if the suffix is not an empty string.

3. **Original Test Output**: The test fails with a `ModuleNotFoundError` due to the missing import path for `AddIndex`. This indicates there is another separate issue, unrelated to the whitespace bug.

4. **Patched Test Output**: The patched output is identical to the original output, as it still shows the `ModuleNotFoundError`. This implies the test setup isn't correctly importing the necessary modules to verify the bug fix, resulting in the inability to execute any of the test logic.

5. **Analysis**:
     - The proposed patch looks appropriate for addressing the whitespace issue in the SQL statement generation if the test could actually run.
     - Neither the original nor the patched test output actually verifies the bug fix due to the `ModuleNotFoundError`, preventing any conclusions from the test results themselves.
     - The issue with the `AddIndex` import needs to be resolved for the test to work correctly.

In conclusion, the patch might resolve the intended whitespace issue based on the code change itself, but the test cannot confirm this due to the unrelated module import problem.

Therefore:

Issue resolved: `False`

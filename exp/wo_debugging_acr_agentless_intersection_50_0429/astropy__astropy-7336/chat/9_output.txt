To resolve the issue with the `units.quantity_input` decorator failing for constructors due to a `None` return type hint, we need to update its logic. Specifically, we should adjust the part where it attempts to convert the return value using `.to` by ensuring the return value isn't `None`.

Below is the `SEARCH/REPLACE` patch in the required format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### astropy/units/decorators.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            if wrapped_signature.return_annotation is not inspect.Signature.empty:\n=======\n            if wrapped_signature.return_annotation is not inspect.Signature.empty and return_ is not None:\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch modifies the conditional check to ensure that `return_` is not `None` before attempting to call the `.to` method on it. This should prevent the `AttributeError` from being raised when the constructor's return type is hinted as `None`.

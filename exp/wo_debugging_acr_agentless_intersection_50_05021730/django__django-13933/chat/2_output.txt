To resolve the issue, I will need to determine how validation errors are raised in the `ModelChoiceField` class, specifically within the `validate` method, which is likely involved in validating the choice.

Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code for the `validate` method from the `django/forms/models.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/forms/models.py", "ModelChoiceField.validate")
```

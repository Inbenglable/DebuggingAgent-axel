### Patch Review

The proposed patch intends to address the issue by modifying the `combine_by_coords` function in `xarray` to ensure it only performs the monotonicity check if the dimension coordinates vary across the datasets being combined. This change is designed to ensure that the function does not incorrectly raise a `ValueError` for non-monotonic coordinates when they are identical across all datasets, as described in the issue.

### Analysis of Test Output

#### Original Output
The original test output indicates that a `ValueError` is raised because the `combine_by_coords` function mistakenly enforces a monotonic constraint on coordinate dimensions that are identical across datasets and hence non-monotonic.

#### Patched Output
After applying the patch, the test output indicates a new error: `TypeError: unhashable type: 'slice'`. This suggests that the patch introduced a logic error, possibly when accessing elements from `combined_ids` or due to incorrect handling of indices or slicing objects within the modified code block.

### Conclusion

The patch intended to fix the bug was not successful, as it replaced the original error (`ValueError`) with a new one (`TypeError`). This means the root cause of the issue—the erroneous enforcement of the monotonicity constraint even when coordinates do not vary—was not resolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

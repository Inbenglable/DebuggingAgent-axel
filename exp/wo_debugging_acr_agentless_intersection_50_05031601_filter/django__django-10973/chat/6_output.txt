Let's analyze the API returned contents:

1. **tests/gis_tests/test_measure.py:run**
   - This function is part of a test suite and involves running a test suite using `unittest.TextTestRunner`. It does not relate to the subprocess running in the context of the `django.db.backends.postgres.client` module or the PostgreSQL backend. Therefore, this is irrelevant.

2. **django/core/servers/basehttp.py:run**
   - This function is related to running a WSGI server and does not involve the subprocess related to PostgreSQL backend in Django. It focuses on setting up a server address and handling HTTP requests. Therefore, this is irrelevant.

After analyzing both contents, neither of them is related to the `postgresql client` within `django.db.backends.postgres.client`. Thus, none of these are needed for resolving the issue.

No file paths can be selected based on the provided results.

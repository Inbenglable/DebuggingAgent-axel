To resolve the issue, we need to pinpoint where the `symbols` function is defined in the Sympy codebase and examine its implementation. This will allow us to understand why parentheses are causing the function to return objects of class `Symbol` instead of `Function`. We can then determine a patch to correct this behavior.

Let's begin by searching for the `symbols` method in the Sympy codebase:

```python
search_method_in_codebase("symbols")
```

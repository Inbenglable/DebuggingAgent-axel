Here is the patch to handle the `ZeroDivisionError` in the `_sparse_fit` method by checking whether there are no support vectors before performing any division operations related to the size of `dual_coef_indices`.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sklearn/svm/base.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        dual_coef_indptr = np.arange(0, dual_coef_indices.size + 1,\n                                     dual_coef_indices.size / n_class)\n=======\n        # Handle the case with no support vectors (n_SV = 0)\n        if n_SV == 0:\n            dual_coef_indptr = np.array([0])\n        else:\n            dual_coef_indptr = np.arange(0, dual_coef_indices.size + 1,\n                                         dual_coef_indices.size / n_class)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch adds a check for when `n_SV` equals zero and prevents division by zero by setting `dual_coef_indptr` to an array containing only zero, effectively handling the edge case without any zero-division errors.

To determine if the issue is resolved, let's analyze the provided patch context and the outputs before and after applying the patch.

### Analysis of the Patch

The patch modifies the `_print_Add` method logic, which is responsible for printing matrix expressions involving addition and subtraction:

1. **Handling of the First Term**:
   - A `first` flag is introduced to handle the first term differently by not prepending a `+` sign if it's positive.

2. **Detecting Multiplication by `-1`**:
   - The logic checks if a term is a multiplication where the first argument is `-1`, indicating it's part of a subtraction, and adjusts the sign accordingly.

3. **Operation Precedence**:
   - The patch ensures that operation precedence is respected during the printing process, so expressions are bracketed correctly if necessary.

### Original vs. Patched Output
- **Original Output**:
  - The test fails with an `AssertionError`.
  - The string representation of `A - A*B - B` is printed as `(-1)*B + (-1)*A*B + A`, displaying the terms with a `(-1)` multiplier instead of using subtraction.

- **Patched Output**:
  - The output remains the same, with the test still failing due to an `AssertionError`.
  - The string representation has not changed, indicating the patch did not affect the output as expected.

### Conclusion
The patch was intended to correctly print matrix expressions using subtraction instead of addition with negative coefficients. However, the `AssertionError` present in both the original and patched outputs indicates that the patch did not resolve the issue; the printing format remains unchanged.

Issue resolved: `False`

Now You need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
method_decorator() should preserve wrapper assignments
Description
	
the function that is passed to the decorator is a partial object and does not have any of the attributes expected from a function i.e. __name__, __module__ etc...
consider the following case
def logger(func):
	@wraps(func)
	def inner(*args, **kwargs):
		try:
			result = func(*args, **kwargs)
		except Exception as e:
			result = str(e)
		finally:
			logger.debug(f"{func.__name__} called with args: {args} and kwargs: {kwargs} resulting: {result}")
	return inner
class Test:
	@method_decorator(logger)
	def hello_world(self):
		return "hello"
Test().test_method()
This results in the following exception
AttributeError: 'functools.partial' object has no attribute '__name__'

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue related to `method_decorator` not preserving wrapper assignments which results in missing function attributes, we need to inspect the source code of the `method_decorator` function in the Django project. The aim is to ensure that the `@wraps` decorator, which is part of Python's standard library (`functools`), is correctly applied to maintain these attributes.

I need to retrieve the source code of the `method_decorator` function to modify its implementation to correctly utilize `functools.wraps`. I will search for the `method_decorator` function's source code within the Django codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("method_decorator")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("method_decorator")
RESULT:
#### django/utils/decorators.py:method_decorator
```python
def method_decorator(decorator, name=''):
    """
    Convert a function decorator into a method decorator
    """
    # 'obj' can be a class or a function. If 'obj' is a function at the time it
    # is passed to _dec,  it will eventually be a method of the class it is
    # defined on. If 'obj' is a class, the 'name' is required to be the name
    # of the method that will be decorated.
    def _dec(obj):
        if not isinstance(obj, type):
            return _multi_decorate(decorator, obj)
        if not (name and hasattr(obj, name)):
            raise ValueError(
                "The keyword argument `name` must be the name of a method "
                "of the decorated class: %s. Got '%s' instead." % (obj, name)
            )
        method = getattr(obj, name)
        if not callable(method):
            raise TypeError(
                "Cannot decorate '%s' as it isn't a callable attribute of "
                "%s (%s)." % (name, obj, method)
            )
        _wrapper = _multi_decorate(decorator, method)
        setattr(obj, name, _wrapper)
        return obj

    # Don't worry about making _dec look similar to a list/tuple as it's rather
    # meaningless.
    if not hasattr(decorator, '__iter__'):
        update_wrapper(_dec, decorator)
    # Change the name to aid debugging.
    obj = decorator if hasattr(decorator, '__name__') else decorator.__class__
    _dec.__name__ = 'method_decorator(%s)' % obj.__name__
    return _dec

```


==================================================

Your Output:
To address the issue, I need to inspect the `_multi_decorate` function because it is responsible for applying the decorator inside the `method_decorator`. This will help me understand why the `__name__` attribute and other expected function attributes are not being properly assigned.

Since I don't have the file path for `_multi_decorate`, I will search for it in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("_multi_decorate")
```

        # 'func'. Also, wrap method.__get__() in a function because new
        # attributes can't be set on bound method objects, only on functions.

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

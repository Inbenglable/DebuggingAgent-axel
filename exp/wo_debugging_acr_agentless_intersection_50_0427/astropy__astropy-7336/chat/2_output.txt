To fix the issue mentioned, I need to look into the `astropy` project's `quantity_input` decorator implementation and see how it handles return values and unit checks.

I will first search for the `quantity_input` method in the `astropy` codebase to locate the relevant code and inspect the handling of return types within it.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("quantity_input")
```

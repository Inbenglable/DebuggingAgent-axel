To address the issue of the `ZeroDivisionError` in the `_sparse_fit` method when the support vectors are empty, we should add a condition to handle cases when `n_class` is zero, which leads to the division by zero error. Specifically, we need to verify if the number of support vectors (`n_SV`) is zero before performing the division. If `n_SV` is zero, we can initialize `self.dual_coef_` to an empty sparse matrix to avoid any errors.

Here are the necessary changes:

        dual_coef_indices = np.tile(np.arange(n_SV), n_class)
        dual_coef_indptr = np.arange(0, dual_coef_indices.size + 1,
                                     dual_coef_indices.size / n_class)
        self.dual_coef_ = sp.csr_matrix(
            (dual_coef_data, dual_coef_indices, dual_coef_indptr),
            (n_class, n_SV))
=======
        if n_SV == 0:
            self.dual_coef_ = sp.csr_matrix((0, 0))
        else:
            dual_coef_indices = np.tile(np.arange(n_SV), n_class)
            dual_coef_indptr = np.arange(0, dual_coef_indices.size + 1,
                                         dual_coef_indices.size / n_class)
            self.dual_coef_ = sp.csr_matrix(
                (dual_coef_data, dual_coef_indices, dual_coef_indptr),
                (n_class, n_SV))

```

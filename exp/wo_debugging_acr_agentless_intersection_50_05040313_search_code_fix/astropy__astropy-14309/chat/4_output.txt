The issue described is an `IndexError` resulting from trying to access an element from an empty tuple, `args`, in the `is_fits` function. The patch aims to fix this by adding a check that ensures the code only attempts to access `args[0]` if `args` is not empty.

### Patch Review

- **Original Code:**
  ```python
  return isinstance(args[0], (HDUList, TableHDU, BinTableHDU, GroupsHDU))
  ```

- **Patched Code:**
  ```python
  return len(args) > 0 and isinstance(args[0], (HDUList, TableHDU, BinTableHDU, GroupsHDU))
  ```

The modification is simple and effective in preventing the `IndexError` by checking the length of `args` before accessing it. If `args` is empty, the function now returns `False` without attempting to access `args[0]`.

### Test Output Analysis

- **Original Output:**
  The test originally failed as expected with an `IndexError` because `args` was an empty tuple and the code attempted to access `args[0]`.

- **Patched Output:**
  After applying the patch, the modified function no longer produces any output, indicating that there are no exceptions being raised, and the original `IndexError` is effectively avoided.

### Conclusion

The patch correctly addresses the issue by preventing the attempted access of an empty tuple, thereby resolving the `IndexError`. As evidenced by the lack of errors in the patched test run, the issue is fixed.

Issue resolved: `True`

To resolve the issue of the `UnboundLocalError` for the `kern` variable in the `kernS` function, I will ensure that `kern` is always defined before it's checked with `hit = kern in s`. We will initiate `kern` before the check to avoid referencing it before assignment.

Here is the patch to fix the issue:

```pythony
### sympy/core/sympify.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if ' ' in s:
            # get a unique kern
=======
        kern = '_'
        if ' ' in s:
            # get a unique kern
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

By ensuring that `kern` is initialized before the condition, we avoid the `UnboundLocalError` when `hit = kern in s` is executed.

Here is the JSON representation:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/core/sympify.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if ' ' in s:\n            # get a unique kern\n=======\n        kern = '_'\n        if ' ' in s:\n            # get a unique kern\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

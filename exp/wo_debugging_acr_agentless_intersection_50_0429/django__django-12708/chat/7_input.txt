## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Migration crashes deleting an index_together if there is a unique_together on the same fields
Description
	
Happens with Django 1.11.10
Steps to reproduce:
1) Create models with 2 fields, add 2 same fields to unique_together and to index_together
2) Delete index_together -> Fail
It will fail at django/db/backends/base/schema.py, line 378, in _delete_composed_index(), ValueError: Found wrong number (2) of constraints for as this one will find two constraints, the _uniq and the _idx one. No way to get out of this...
The worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the "new" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.
I think there are 2 different points here:
1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together
2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To address this issue, I need to examine the `_delete_composed_index` method located in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`. This method is crucial because the error described occurs here, and analyzing its implementation will help me understand the problem better and guide the generation of a patch.

Additionally, I may need to check the related migration handling methods and classes or any unique/index handling in the Django migrations framework to see where adjustments might be needed, particularly in relation to `unique_together` and `index_together`.

Therefore, I will start by retrieving the source code for the `_delete_composed_index` method.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "_delete_composed_index")
```

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "_delete_composed_index")
RESULT:
#### django/db/backends/base/schema.py:BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor._delete_composed_index
```python
    def _delete_composed_index(self, model, fields, constraint_kwargs, sql):
        meta_constraint_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.constraints}
        meta_index_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.indexes}
        columns = [model._meta.get_field(field).column for field in fields]
        constraint_names = self._constraint_names(
            model, columns, exclude=meta_constraint_names | meta_index_names,
            **constraint_kwargs
        )
        if len(constraint_names) != 1:
            raise ValueError("Found wrong number (%s) of constraints for %s(%s)" % (
                len(constraint_names),
                model._meta.db_table,
                ", ".join(columns),
            ))
        self.execute(self._delete_constraint_sql(sql, model, constraint_names[0]))

```


==================================================

Your Output:
Based on the issue reported, the `ValueError` arises because `_delete_composed_index` fails when there are multiple constraints found, including both unique and index constraints.

To address this issue, we need to look into:
1. How unique constraints (`unique_together`) and index constraints (`index_together`) are defined and managed within Django's schema migrations.
2. Check related methods that might interact with `_delete_composed_index` to handle constraints.

Although we've reviewed `_delete_composed_index`, we potentially need to ensure correct management and identification of constraints. Using the new `Options.indexes` might also involve `indexes`.

Therefore, the key points to review are:
- The method `_delete_composed_index` for removing constraints.
- How migrations identify constraints, focusing on `unique_together` and `index_together`.

We'll inspect the related classes and methods, ensuring we have a comprehensive understanding of what's causing the error. For this, I want to first better understand how constraints are managed in migrations.

Let's find the class `Options` to check `indexes` and other relevant handling parts.

==================================================

Your Output:
To tackle this issue, we need to ensure we understand how constraints are identified and managed, particularly when both `unique_together` and `index_together` are present. 

We've reviewed the `_delete_composed_index` method, which is responsible for deleting constraints, and we've looked at the `Options` class, although its definition doesn't include specific management of indexes or unique constraints. 

The next logical step is to understand how migration files handle both the index and unique constraints, especially in terms of defining and deleting them. We will need to inspect migration methods or classes that interact with `unique_together` and `index_together`.

I will look into migration-related logic that might affect these constraints:

```python
search_class_in_codebase("IndexConstraint")
search_method_in_codebase("_generate_index_name")
search_method_in_codebase("_create_index_sql")
search_method_in_codebase("_delete_constraint_sql")
```

This search will help us understand how Django generates, creates, and deletes indexes and constraints, giving us a clearer picture of where adjustments are necessary to resolve the issue at hand.

==================================================

Your Output:
In order to address the issue, I've analyzed the current information gathered from the code. The `_delete_composed_index` method is crucial in understanding how constraints are identified and managed. The core issue seems to stem from a conflict between `index_together` and `unique_together` constraints during migrations. 

From what I have retrieved so far, I have not yet gathered the full details of some components that may directly affect the issue—specifically, how Django handles `unique_together` in migrations.

Let me review the class or methods that deal specifically with `unique_together` and its management during migrations to see how they might interact with `index_together`.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("_constraint_names")
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor._constraint_names")
```
This should provide insights into why multiple constraints are found and help identify the necessary adjustments to resolve the issue.

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

Upon reviewing the details given:

### Patch Review:
The patch involves modifying a conditional statement in the `django/forms/formsets.py` file. Specifically, it updates the `if` statement to include a check for whether `index` is `None`, changing from:

```python
if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or index < initial_form_count):
```

to:

```python
if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or (index is not None and index < initial_form_count)):
```

This change effectively prevents errors related to the comparison of `NoneType` and `int`, which was causing a `TypeError`.

### Analysis of Outputs:

#### Original Output:
The original output demonstrates that when the `add_fields()` method is invoked, a `TypeError` occurs because `index` is `None`. This confirms that the issue was present.

#### Patched Output:
The patched output shows no occurrence of a `TypeError`. Instead, it prints details of a Django form, followed by "The issue is fixed." This suggests that the condition has been correctly modified to no longer attempt the problematic comparison.

### Conclusion:

The patch effectively prevents the `TypeError` by adding a check for `index` being `None`, resolving the specific issue described in the bug report. The absence of errors and the correct function output after applying the patch are consistent with the test intended outcomes.

**Issue resolved: `True`**

The issue reported describes an unintended behavior introduced between versions 3.4.1 and 3.4.2 of Matplotlib where shared axes, when cleared and reused, display extra ticks and previously hidden tick labels.

### Analysis

The problem appears after the `ax.clear()` call, which internally calls the `Axes.cla()` method. This method is responsible for clearing the axes in Matplotlib. The clearing function should reset the axes to a default state, but after clearing, the behavior regarding shared tick labels and ticks has changed between versions.

The code for reproduction creates subplots with shared axes (`sharex=True, sharey=True`), clears each axis, and then plots data on them again. In version 3.4.2 and beyond, this results in all tick labels being visible rather than respecting the share configuration.

### Current Observations
- `plt.subplots(2, 2, sharex=True, sharey=True)` should configure axes such that only one set of tick labels is visible when globally shared.
- `ax.clear()` results in tick labels appearing on previously hidden axes.
- No changes or custom ticks should appear after clearing if they were initially set to be off.

Considering this behavior revolves around the shared state after calling `clear()`, it's logical to assume that the implementation within the method responsible for clearing an axis or related configuration might have been altered or is not correctly re-establishing the shared states.

### Next Steps
I will proceed to observe the `Axes.cla` method, as this is directly invoked when `ax.clear()` is called, which is likely related to the change in behavior.

Observed method: `lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py:Axes.cla`

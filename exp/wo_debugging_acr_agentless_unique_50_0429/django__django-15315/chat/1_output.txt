To resolve this issue, we need to inspect the `Field` class and its `__hash__` method, as well as any related methods that might influence the behavior when a field is assigned to a model class. 

I'll need to search for the `Field` class and the `__hash__` method to understand their current implementation and determine what changes were introduced in #31750. 

Here are the necessary steps to gather that information:

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Field")
search_method_in_codebase("Field.__hash__")
search_code_in_codebase("31750")
```

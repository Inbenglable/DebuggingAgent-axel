## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Adding nullable OneToOneField crashes on SQLite.
Description
	
This new sqlite3 error has cropped up between building django-oauth-toolkit between Django 4.0 and main branch for migrations.AddField of a OneToOneField (see â€‹https://github.com/jazzband/django-oauth-toolkit/issues/1064):
self = <django.db.backends.sqlite3.base.SQLiteCursorWrapper object at 0x10b8038b0>
query = 'ALTER TABLE "oauth2_provider_accesstoken" ADD COLUMN "source_refresh_token_id" bigint NULL UNIQUE REFERENCES "oauth2_provider_refreshtoken" ("id") DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED'
params = []
	def execute(self, query, params=None):
		if params is None:
			return Database.Cursor.execute(self, query)
		query = self.convert_query(query)
>	 return Database.Cursor.execute(self, query, params)
E	 django.db.utils.OperationalError: Cannot add a UNIQUE column
Here's the relevant migration snippet: 
		migrations.AddField(
			model_name='AccessToken',
			name='source_refresh_token',
			field=models.OneToOneField(blank=True, null=True, on_delete=django.db.models.deletion.SET_NULL, to=oauth2_settings.REFRESH_TOKEN_MODEL, related_name="refreshed_access_token"),
		),
I see there have been a lot of sqlite3 changes in #33355 since the 4.0 release....

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue, we need to modify the migration logic when adding a nullable `OneToOneField` with a unique constraint in SQLite. Since we are dealing specifically with the migration alteration under SQLite backend, it would be necessary to check the code related to handling SQLite migrations in the Django codebase, especially how nullable unique columns are handled. 

I am going to search for the related migration logic or classes in the Django codebase that would handle this kind of situation. Likely places to look at are the migration operations, particularly `AddField`, and any SQLite-specific backend code dealing with migrations.

Let's search for the `AddField` method in the Django project's related migration files.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("AddField")
search_class_in_codebase("SQLite")
```

==================================================

Your Output:
To resolve the issue, I need to understand how the `SQLiteSchemaEditor` class handles the addition of fields, specifically the `add_field` method. This class should be responsible for constructing and executing SQL commands, which likely include handling nullable fields and unique constraints.

I will search for the `SQLiteSchemaEditor` class to examine its implementation, especially its `add_field` method, which seems to be related to the issue.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("SQLiteSchemaEditor")
search_method_in_codebase("SQLiteSchemaEditor.add_field")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("SQLiteSchemaEditor.add_field")
RESULT:
#### django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py:DatabaseSchemaEditor.add_field
```python
    def add_field(self, model, field):
        """Create a field on a model."""
        # Fields with default values cannot by handled by ALTER TABLE ADD
        # COLUMN statement because DROP DEFAULT is not supported in
        # ALTER TABLE.
        if not field.null or self.effective_default(field) is not None:
            self._remake_table(model, create_field=field)
        else:
            super().add_field(model, field)

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

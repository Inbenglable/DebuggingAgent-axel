To address the issue, we need to find the code responsible for verifying extension versions in the Sphinx project. This typically involves finding where the `needs_extensions` feature is defined and implemented. It's likely located within the Sphinx codebase, possibly in a specific module or file that handles extensions or version checks.

Since we need the source code responsible for this version comparison, I'll use the search APIs to locate the relevant method or code snippet.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("needs_extensions")
search_code_in_codebase("version")
```

Upon reviewing the API returned contents, it's essential to filter out any irrelevant entries that do not pertain to the prefetching related functionality and the interaction of the ORM with UUID fields in the context of GenericForeignKeys. The focus should be on the Django ORM handling of `GenericForeignKey`, `prefetch_related`, and `UUIDField` specifically in models and associated Django source.

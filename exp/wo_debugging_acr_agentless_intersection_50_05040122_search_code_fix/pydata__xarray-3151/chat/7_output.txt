Based on the information provided, let's analyze the patch and the test outputs:

### Patch Analysis

1. **Search and Replace Edits:**
   - The patch modifies the logic in the `xarray/core/combine.py` file. 
   - The first modification checks if the `indexes` for each dimension are identical across datasets and skips further checks if they are.
   - The second modification changes the monotonicity check. If a dimension in the combined dataset does not have monotonic indexes, it checks whether these are coordinate dimensions that are identical across datasets. If they are, it bypasses the error raise, otherwise, it raises the ValueError as before.

### Test Output Analysis

- **Original Test Output (Before the Patch):**
  - The test raises a `ValueError` with the message: "Resulting object does not have monotonic global indexes along dimension y" which results in an `AssertionError`.

- **Patched Test Output:**
  - The patched code exits with a message: "Issue is fixed. Exiting with code 0." This indicates that the `combine_by_coords` function no longer raises an error with non-monotonic but identical coordinates.

### Conclusion

The patch effectively bypasses the monotonicity check for identical non-coordinate dimensions, which resolves the issue as described. The test that initially failed with a `ValueError` now passes, confirming that the issue has been resolved.

**Issue resolved: `True`**

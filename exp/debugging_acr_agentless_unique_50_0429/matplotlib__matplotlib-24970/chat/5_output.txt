I need to gather the source code for the `Colormap.__call__` method. We have identified this method as a critical component involved in processing color mappings and handling indices, which are linked to the deprecation warnings. Let's retrieve the source code for this method to examine how indices are determined and potentially modify them to eliminate the deprecation warnings.

```python
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/colors.py", "Colormap.__call__")
```

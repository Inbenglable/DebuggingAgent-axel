To resolve this issue, we need to understand how the `URLValidator` is currently implemented and how it interacts with the handling of line feed (`LF`), carriage return (`CR`), and tab characters. Since these tests are failing due to changes in URL splitting that now strip these characters, we need to get insights into the `URLValidator` implementation to determine where and how these characters should be handled.

I need to first retrieve the `URLValidator` implementation to find a suitable patch for this issue. I'll start by searching for the `URLValidator` class in the codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("URLValidator")
```

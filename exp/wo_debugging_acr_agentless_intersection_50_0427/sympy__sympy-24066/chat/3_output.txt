The issue arises because the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method fails to recognize `exp(expr)` as dimensionless when `expr` itself is dimensionless. Based on the source code retrieved, I need to understand how dimensionless checks are performed in the SI dimension system. Therefore, I need to further examine how the `get_dimension_system` and `is_dimensionless` methods operate. These methods could provide insight into why dimensionless exponents are not being processed correctly.

Firstly, I need to check how the `get_dimension_system()` function works in the `UnitSystem`, and understand its role in dimensionless checks.

I will proceed to search for the `get_dimension_system()` method in the `unitsystem.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py", "get_dimension_system")
```

If necessary, I will also check the `DimensionSystem.is_dimensionless` method to understand its implementation and potentially adjust the handling of dimensionless exponents.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("DimensionSystem.is_dimensionless")
```

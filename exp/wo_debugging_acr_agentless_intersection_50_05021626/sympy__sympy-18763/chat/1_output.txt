To resolve the issue, I need to modify the LaTeX printer for the `Subs` expression in SymPy. The method responsible for LaTeX printing is likely located within the `latex.py` file or similar, which handles LaTeX printing of various expressions, including `Subs`.

I will need to search for the method related to the LaTeX printing of `Subs`. Let's proceed to find the relevant source code.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("Subs._latex")
search_method_in_codebase("_print_Subs")
```

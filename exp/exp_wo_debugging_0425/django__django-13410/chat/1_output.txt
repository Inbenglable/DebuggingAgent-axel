I need to retrieve the current implementation of the `lock` and `unlock` functions in the `django/core/files/locks.py` file to make the necessary changes. I'll search for these methods in the specified file.

```python
search_code_in_file("django/core/files/locks.py", "def lock(f, flags):")
search_code_in_file("django/core/files/locks.py", "def unlock(f):")
```

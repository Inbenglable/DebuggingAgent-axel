**Analysis of Current Observed Code and Abnormal Program Behavior:**

The `MethodDocumenter.format_signature` method is designed to format and return a method's signature in the context of the Sphinx autodoc extension. It handles several scenarios, such as overloaded methods and singledispatch methods, and constructs appropriate signatures for these cases. However, this method doesn't appear to deal with the addition or removal of parentheses explicitly within its logic.

The method utilizes functions like `stringify_signature` to convert overload or dispatch function signatures into string form. Despite the presence of complex signature formation logic, especially for dispatched methods or overloads, we don't see explicit logic regarding parentheses handling for the `:property:` directive here.

The runtime traceback points to an `AssertionError` related to the `dbgsnooper` setup, which prevents further execution and hinders our ability to deeply trace how the method interacts with index entries in its full context. This runtime error arises due to a file path not existing, likely pointing to a setup misconfiguration during testing.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the observed code and available information, it doesn't appear that `MethodDocumenter.format_signature` is directly responsible for the incorrect addition of parentheses in index entries. Instead, this code snippet seems focused on reconstructing method signatures according to its own configuration and special cases like overloads or singledispatch methods.

**Next Steps in Tracing:**

To find where incorrectly formatted parentheses might be introduced for properties, it would be beneficial to trace further upstream or downstream, potentially where the `:property:` directive's interaction with `MethodDocumenter` or `PropertyDocumenter` influences how signatures are processed or indexed.

The next step is to observe how these generated signatures impact the final index entries or how the `:property:` directive is being mistakenly interpreted within broader indexing logic.

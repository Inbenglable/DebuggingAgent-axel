To address the issue, I need to modify the instantiation of the `CommandParser` within the `ManagementUtility` class. Since the specific method where the `CommandParser` is instantiated has not been identified yet, I will need to retrieve the source code for the `ManagementUtility` class to locate the relevant section.

To proceed, I will search for the source code of the `ManagementUtility` class in the specified file.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/core/management/__init__.py", "ManagementUtility")
```

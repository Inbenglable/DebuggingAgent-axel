From the runtime information provided, it's evident that a problem arises when executing the `makemigrations` command due to the `EOFError`, which occurs from trying to read user input during a non-interactive test run. The issue is located in the method `InteractiveMigrationQuestioner._boolean_input`, where it attempts to prompt a question and read a line of input using the `input()` function.

Here's the specific behavior observed:

1. The `makemigrations` command tries to confirm certain changes through prompts, using `InteractiveMigrationQuestioner`.
2. This results in an `EOFError` because the `input()` function can't read user input in a non-interactive test environment, as seen from the call stack.

To resolve this in a test environment, the Django management command should avoid user interaction and use defaults or be replaced by a test-compatible questioner.

At this moment, the buggy method is identified:

Buggy method: `django/db/migrations/questioner.py:InteractiveMigrationQuestioner._boolean_input`

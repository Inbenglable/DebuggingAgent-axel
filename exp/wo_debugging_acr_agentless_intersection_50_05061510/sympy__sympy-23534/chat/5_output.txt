Here's the patch in *SEARCH/REPLACE* format to resolve the issue with the `symbols` function ensuring it respects the `cls` argument when parentheses are used:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/core/symbol.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            result.append(symbols(name, **args))\n=======\n            result.append(symbols(name, cls=cls, **args))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch ensures that the `cls` argument is explicitly passed in the recursive call when handling iterable `names`, thus maintaining consistency with the expected behavior of creating instances of `Function` where specified.

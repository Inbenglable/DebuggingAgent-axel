## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
QuerySet.none() on combined queries returns all results.
Description
	
I came across this issue on Stack Overflow. I'm not 100% sure it's a bug, but it does seem strange. With this code (excuse the bizarre example filtering):
class Publication(models.Model):
	pass
class Article(models.Model):
	publications = models.ManyToManyField(to=Publication, blank=True, null=True)
class ArticleForm(forms.ModelForm):
	publications = forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField(
		Publication.objects.filter(id__lt=2) | Publication.objects.filter(id__gt=5),
		required=False,
	)
	class Meta:
		model = Article
		fields = ["publications"]
class ArticleAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
	form = ArticleForm
This works well. However, changing the ModelMultipleChoiceField queryset to use union() breaks things.
publications = forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField(
	Publication.objects.filter(id__lt=2).union(
		Publication.objects.filter(id__gt=5)
	),
	required=False,
)
The form correctly shows only the matching objects. However, if you submit this form while empty (i.e. you didn't select any publications), ALL objects matching the queryset will be added. Using the OR query, NO objects are added, as I'd expect.

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
The issue described arises from using the `union()` operation on QuerySets within a `ModelMultipleChoiceField`. When the form is submitted empty, all objects matching the queryset are added instead of none, as expected. This indicates a problem with how QuerySet unions are processed when the form is submitted without any selections.

To resolve this issue, it is necessary to review how Django handles `union()` operations in QuerySets and the behavior of `ModelMultipleChoiceField` during form submission when no selections are made. Specifically, I need to understand how the `union` affects the usual behavior when the form is submitted empty.

I need to retrieve the source code relevant to the `union()` operation on QuerySets and how it interacts with `ModelMultipleChoiceField`. I will start by searching for the `union()` method and related classes or methods involved in processing querysets and form fields in Django.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("QuerySet.union")
search_class_in_codebase("ModelMultipleChoiceField")
search_method_in_codebase("QuerySet.none")
```

Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("QuerySet.union")
RESULT:

```python
    def union(self, *other_qs, all=False):
        # If the query is an EmptyQuerySet, combine all nonempty querysets.
        if isinstance(self, EmptyQuerySet):
            qs = [q for q in other_qs if not isinstance(q, EmptyQuerySet)]
            return qs[0]._combinator_query('union', *qs[1:], all=all) if qs else self
        return self._combinator_query('union', *other_qs, all=all)

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

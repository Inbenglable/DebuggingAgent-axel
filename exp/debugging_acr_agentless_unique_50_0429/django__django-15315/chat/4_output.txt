To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code for the `Field.__hash__` method to understand its current implementation and determine how we can make the hash immutable. Given that we are aware of the file path, I will proceed with retrieving the method's source code.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/fields/__init__.py", "Field.__hash__")
```

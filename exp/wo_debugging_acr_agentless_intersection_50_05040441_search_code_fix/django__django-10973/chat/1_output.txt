To resolve the issue, I need to modify the code responsible for invoking the PostgreSQL client in the `django.db.backends.postgresql.client` module. Specifically, I need to update the subprocess call to use `subprocess.run` and set the `PGPASSWORD` environment variable.

To generate the patch, I first need to retrieve the source code of the relevant method(s). Given the description, it likely involves a method in the PostgreSQL backend client module, but I need to determine the exact method name and its file path.

I'll use the search APIs to find the appropriate code.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("subprocess_call")  # Placeholder for actual method name if known
search_code_in_codebase("django.db.backends.postgresql.client")
```

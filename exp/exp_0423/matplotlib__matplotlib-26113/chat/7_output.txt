The patch changes the condition from `len(acc) > mincnt` to `len(acc) >= mincnt` in the handling of the `mincnt` parameter when the `C` parameter is specified. This aligns the behavior of the hexbin function when the `mincnt` parameter is used with or without the `C` parameter.

Analyzing the test outputs before and after applying the patch:

**Before the patch:**
- With `C` and `mincnt=1`, some grid points that contain a single data point were excluded.
- Without `C` and with `mincnt=1`, only grid points containing at least one datum were included.

**After the patch:**
- Both test cases (with and without `C`) show consistent behavior by including grid points that contain at least one datum when `mincnt=1`.

This matches the expected behavior described in the bug report where grid points with at least `mincnt` data points are intended to be shown. The inconsistency based on the presence of the `C` parameter is resolved.

Issue resolved: `True`

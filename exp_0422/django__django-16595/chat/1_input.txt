**Current Task:**  
Resolve the following issue in the django project:
#### ISSUE
Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField
Description
	
Let's consider the following operations: 
operations = [
	migrations.AddField(
		model_name="book",
		name="title",
		field=models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True),
	),
	migrations.AlterField(
		model_name="book",
		name="title",
		field=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True),
	),
	migrations.AlterField(
		model_name="book",
		name="title",
		field=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text="help"),
	),
	migrations.AlterField(
		model_name="book",
		name="title",
		field=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text="help", default=None),
	),
]
If I run the optimizer, I get only the AddField, as we could expect. However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:
optimizer.optimize(operations[1:], "books") 
[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,
 <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,
 <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]
Indeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. 
Is this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? 
Otherwise, would it make sense to add something like
		if isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(
			operation
		):
			return [operation]


Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:

class Field:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        self.kwargs = kwargs

    def __repr__(self):
        attrs = [f"{k}={v!r}" for k, v in self.kwargs.items()]
        return f"CharField({', '.join(attrs)})"

class Operation:
    def __init__(self, model_name, name):
        self.model_name = model_name
        self.name = name

    def is_same_model_operation(self, operation):
        return self.model_name.lower() == operation.model_name.lower()

    def is_same_field_operation(self, operation):
        return (
            self.is_same_model_operation(operation)
            and self.name.lower() == operation.name.lower()
        )

    def references_field(self, model_name, name, app_label):
        return (
            model_name.lower() == self.model_name.lower()
            and name.lower() == self.name.lower()
        )

    def reduce(self, operation, app_label):
        return not operation.references_field(self.model_name, self.name, app_label)

class AlterField(Operation):
    def __init__(self, model_name, name, field):
        super().__init__(model_name, name)
        self.field = field

    def describe(self):
        return f"Alter field {self.name} on {self.model_name}"

    def reduce(self, operation, app_label):
        if isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(operation):
            # Return the latest AlterField operation since it contains all the changes
            return [operation]
        return super().reduce(operation, app_label)

class MigrationOptimizer:
    def optimize(self, operations, app_label):
        self._iterations = 0
        while True:
            result = self.optimize_inner(operations, app_label)
            self._iterations += 1
            if result == operations:
                return result
            operations = result

    def optimize_inner(self, operations, app_label):
        new_operations = []
        for i, operation in enumerate(operations):
            right = True  # Should we reduce on the right or on the left
            # Compare it to each operation after it
            for j, other in enumerate(operations[i + 1:]):
                result = operation.reduce(other, app_label)
                if isinstance(result, list):
                    in_between = operations[i + 1:i + j + 1]
                    if right:
                        new_operations.extend(in_between)

                        # operations can optimize through other.
                        new_operations.extend(result)
                        new_operations.extend(in_between)
                    else:
                        # Otherwise keep trying.
                        new_operations.append(operation)
                        break
                    new_operations.extend(operations[i + j + 2:])
                    return new_operations
                elif not result:
                    # Can't perform a right reduction.
                    right = False
            else:
                new_operations.append(operation)
        return new_operations

# Test case
operations = [
    AlterField(
        model_name="book",
        name="title",
        field=Field(max_length=128, null=True),
    ),
    AlterField(
        model_name="book",
        name="title",
        field=Field(max_length=128, null=True, help_text="help"),
    ),
    AlterField(
        model_name="book",
        name="title",
        field=Field(max_length=128, null=True, help_text="help", default=None),
    ),
]

optimizer = MigrationOptimizer()
result = optimizer.optimize(operations, "books")
print("Number of operations after optimization:", len(result))
print("\nOptimized operations:")
for op in result:
    print(f"- {op.describe()}")
print("\nFinal field state:", result[-1].field if result else None)

**Test Execution Results:**

Number of operations after optimization: 1

Optimized operations:
- Alter field title on book

Final field state: CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text='help', default=None)


Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

1. Create a minimal debugging test based on the reproduce test.
2. Debug by reviewing the relevant source code and monitoring runtime information.
3. Once you have identified the root cause, modify the code with minimal changes.
4. Rerun the reproduction script to confirm that the issue is fixed.

Focus on Step 1: generate a debugging test. At the end of your analysis, provide the specific code in the following **JSON format**.
Note: You should clearly specify the tests you are debugging as much as possible. Minimizing the amount of code will better assist you in analyzing runtime information later.

"debugging_test" : "import ... # Your debugging test code here"

To resolve the issue mentioned, we need to add support for the `Min` and `Max` functions in the `PythonCodePrinter` class. Given the outline of the solution, including the methods `_print_Min` and `_print_Max`, it is essential to find the existing implementation of the `PythonCodePrinter` class so that we can add these methods accordingly. Therefore, we first need to retrieve the source code of `PythonCodePrinter`.

Since I do not have the file path of the `PythonCodePrinter`, I will search for the class code first.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("PythonCodePrinter")
```

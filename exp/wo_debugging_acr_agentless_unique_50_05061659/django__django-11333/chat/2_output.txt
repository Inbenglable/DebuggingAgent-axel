To address the issue, I have already gathered the relevant parts of the codebase for `get_resolver`, `get_urlconf`, and the `URLResolver` class including its `_populate` method. These are sufficient to modify how `get_resolver` constructs and caches the `URLResolver` instances by referring to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` before the memoized call. 

Therefore, I am ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

To identify the root cause of the issue with the `:kbd:` role in the Sphinx project, we need to trace the methods involved in generating the HTML output for this role. According to the issue description and the observed test, the problem lies in how certain characters (`-`, `+`, `^`) are treated, especially when they are part of standalone keystrokes or compound keystrokes.

We'll start by examining the most likely file involved in the rendering of roles, which should be responsible for interpreting the `:kbd:` role and generating its HTML representation.

Observed method: `sphinx/roles.py:KbdRole.run` 

This method is likely responsible for processing text defined by the `:kbd:` role and may contain the logic for interpreting separators and generating the corresponding HTML output. Let's observe this method to verify its behavior and understand how it handles input text.

To resolve this issue, I need to examine the `linkcheck` command's source code, particularly how it handles anchors and HTTP status codes. It's likely that the relevant code will be found in classes or methods related to link checking functionality. To proceed, I will first need to gather the source code related to link checking.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("linkcheck")
search_method_in_codebase("linkcheck_anchors")
search_class_in_codebase("LinkChecker")
search_class_in_codebase("LinkCheckBuilder")
```

The provided test script demonstrates the issue in the Django project where the culling process of the database cache backend occasionally fails with the error `'NoneType' object is not subscriptable`. The failure message indicates the cursor did not fetch a result from the SQL execution for culling cache keys.

From the debug output and test results, we observe that the line `cursor.fetchone()[0]` potentially operates on a `None` return, which leads to a `TypeError` if there are no rows fetched.

To locate the buggy method, we will focus on the `_cull` method in the `DatabaseCache` class that triggers this issue. The relevant file path and method are:
```
Observed method: django/core/cache/backends/db.py:DatabaseCache._cull
```

We need to ensure this method properly handles the case when no rows are returned by the SQL query. Observing this method will help pinpoint the necessary modification(s) to prevent this intermittent error.

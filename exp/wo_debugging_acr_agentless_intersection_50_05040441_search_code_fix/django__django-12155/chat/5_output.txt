To resolve the issue, I'll modify the `trim_docstring` function to skip the first line when calculating indentation, as per the solution you've outlined. This will ensure that the docstring handling works correctly even if the first line is not empty. Here's the patch in the specified format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())\n=======\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch modifies the calculation of the indentation by skipping the first line (`lines[1:]`). This change should solve the reported issue without altering any other functionality.

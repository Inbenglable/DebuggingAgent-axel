To fix this issue, we need to locate the `bar` method in the Matplotlib library, which is likely responsible for handling bar charts.

### Analysis

From the traceback, the `bar` method is within the `Axes` class in the `_axes.py` file. The error originates from `Axes._convert_dx` method, which utilizes `cbook._safe_first_finite`.

We need to examine the following:

1. `Axes.bar`: To confirm how inputs are being handled and passed to `_convert_dx`.
2. `Axes._convert_dx`: To understand the logic for handling NaN values, specifically checking how it handles sequences of values and look for areas like usage of `cbook._safe_first_finite`.
3. `cbook._safe_first_finite`: To evaluate and potentially modify the behavior to handle NaN inputs gracefully.

The goal is to ensure that inputs consisting entirely of NaN values do not lead to exceptions and instead return useful information, as was the case in previous versions.

### Source Code Retrieval Plan

Let's retrieve the source code for the following methods:

1. `Axes.bar` in `matplotlib/axes/_axes.py`.
2. `Axes._convert_dx` in `matplotlib/axes/_axes.py`.
3. `_safe_first_finite` in `matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py`.

```python
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py", "Axes.bar")
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py", "Axes._convert_dx")
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py", "_safe_first_finite")
```

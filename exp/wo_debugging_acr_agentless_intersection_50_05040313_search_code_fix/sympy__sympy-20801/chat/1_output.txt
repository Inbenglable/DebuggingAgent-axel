To address the issue, we need to determine the behavior of comparisons involving `S.false` and `S(0.0)`. The methods involved in these comparisons are likely related to the `Basic`, `boolalg.Boolean`, or `boolalg.BooleanAtom` classes within the SymPy library. To confirm the exact method handling these comparisons, I will search the codebase for these classes and investigate their comparison methods.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("BooleanAtom")
search_class_in_codebase("Boolean")
search_class_in_codebase("Basic")
```

[Bug]: NumPy 1.24 deprecation warnings
### Bug summary

Starting NumPy 1.24 I observe several deprecation warnings.


### Code for reproduction

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

plt.get_cmap()(np.empty((0, ), dtype=np.uint8))
```


### Actual outcome

```
/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/matplotlib/colors.py:730: DeprecationWarning: NumPy will stop allowing conversion of out-of-bound Python integers to integer arrays.  The conversion of 257 to uint8 will fail in the future.
For the old behavior, usually:
    np.array(value).astype(dtype)`
will give the desired result (the cast overflows).
  xa[xa > self.N - 1] = self._i_over
/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/matplotlib/colors.py:731: DeprecationWarning: NumPy will stop allowing conversion of out-of-bound Python integers to integer arrays.  The conversion of 256 to uint8 will fail in the future.
For the old behavior, usually:
    np.array(value).astype(dtype)`
will give the desired result (the cast overflows).

This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
The issue at hand involves deprecation warnings arising from the use of NumPy 1.24 within the `matplotlib` library. Specifically, the warnings occur because of the impending failure of out-of-bound Python integers to automatically convert to integer arrays for the `uint8` data type. The observed code triggering the warning resides inside `matplotlib.colors`, as evidenced by the trace:

- The problematic code involves converting the integer values 256, 257, and 258 into `np.uint8` arrays. Since these values exceed the bounds of `uint8`, which ranges from 0 to 255, they trigger a `DeprecationWarning` in the latest versions of NumPy.

The stack trace points to the `matplotlib` module (`matplotlib/colors.py`) where the operations involving these integer values take place. Consequently, the potentially buggy methods relating to these deprecation warnings in `matplotlib.colors` have yet to be fully explored.

For precise bug localization, we should investigate the relevant parts of the `colors.py` file, especially the method(s) responsible for handling arrays within colormap operations.

Thus, let's proceed by observing the next method in the trace to further narrow down the issue:

Observed method: `lib/matplotlib/colors.py:_BaseColorMap.__call__`
==================================================
The issue arises from the deprecation warning related to out-of-bound Python integers being converted to `uint8` arrays in NumPy 1.24. Specifically, in the code snippet provided, this is triggered by the line:

```python
cmap(np.array([256, 257, 258], dtype=np.uint8))
```

The integers 256, 257, and 258 are beyond the boundary of the `uint8` data type, which only allows values in the range 0-255. This issue is likely being triggered in the `colors.py` file in Matplotlib, where conversions might be occurring without boundary checks or appropriate handling for such cases.

Currently, we observed the `NoNorm.__call__` method, which simply returns the input value. This method does not appear to be directly involved in the integer conversion, as it performs no operations that could change the input. Therefore, it might not be where the bug is located.

To locate the issue, we should trace further into `matplotlib/colors.py`, focusing on the part of the code that interacts with NumPy arrays where these warnings are being raised (exact lines weren't detailed, but likely involve operations interacting with `uint8` arrays).

Given that, we need to take a closer look at the surrounding code in `matplotlib.colors` where values are handled or transformed in connection with color maps. Let's proceed to observe the lines around where the warnings are triggered in the stack trace you provided:

Observed scope: `lib/matplotlib/colors.py:720-740` 

This capture encompasses the area cited in the initial deprecation warning messages, around line 730, where the conversion messages were encountered.
==================================================


Now you choose NoNorm.__call__'s code snippet 
   720	                # Negative values are out of range, but astype(int) would
   721	                # truncate them towards zero.
   722	                xa[xa < 0] = -1
   723	                # xa == 1 (== N after multiplication) is not out of range.
   724	                xa[xa == self.N] = self.N - 1
   725	                # Avoid converting large positive values to negative integers.
   726	                np.clip(xa, -1, self.N, out=xa)
   727	                xa = xa.astype(int)
   728	        # Set the over-range indices before the under-range;
   729	        # otherwise the under-range values get converted to over-range.
   730	        xa[xa > self.N - 1] = self._i_over
   731	        xa[xa < 0] = self._i_under
   732	        xa[mask_bad] = self._i_bad
   733	
   734	        lut = self._lut
   735	        if bytes:
   736	            lut = (lut * 255).astype(np.uint8)
   737	
   738	        rgba = lut.take(xa, axis=0, mode='clip')
   739	
   740	        if alpha is not None:

You need to trace the abnormal program behavior step by step to identify the root cause of the bug and locate the buggy method that contains the code to be fixed.
Now, please first analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior. 

Then, if you can already locate the buggy method and buggy code, reply with:  
Buggy method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Otherwise, continue tracing by selecting the next method to observe. Reply with: 
Observed method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Note that {FILE_PATH} refers to the path relative to the repository. And if you want to observe a method inside a class, please specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME.

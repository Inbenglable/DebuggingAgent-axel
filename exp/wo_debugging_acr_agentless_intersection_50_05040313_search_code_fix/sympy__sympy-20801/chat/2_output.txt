To resolve the issue where `S(0.0) == S.false` returns `True`, but `S.false == S(0.0)` returns `False`, I'll need to examine the equality method within the relevant classes. Given that `BooleanAtom`, `Boolean`, and `Basic` are potentially involved in controlling the behavior of `==`, I'll proceed to gather the source code of the `__eq__` method in the `Basic` class as it might play a crucial role in this comparison.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/core/basic.py", "Basic.__eq__")
search_class_in_file("sympy/logic/boolalg.py", "BooleanAtom")
search_class_in_file("sympy/logic/boolalg.py", "Boolean")
```

To address the issue at hand, I need to review the relevant portion of the source code associated with the `select_related` and `only` methods. Specifically, you'll need to examine the `django/db/models/sql/query.py` file, as the error message suggests changes might be made around line 745. I'll proceed with retrieving the relevant code.

```python
search_code_in_file("django/db/models/sql/query.py", "opts = cur_model._meta")
```

To address the issue of migration file import ordering, we need to find the source code responsible for generating migration files, particularly the ordering of import statements. The search query for searching classes named "Migration" mostly returned test files related to migrations but not the core logic where migration files are actually generated. These test files aren't directly responsible for the generation or the import order of migration files.

We should focus our analysis on the primary Django files that likely generate migration files or manage their structure. Since the returned paths are related to testing various aspects of migrations, they are less likely to contain the logic that writes migration files or determines import order. 

After reviewing the results, here is the relevant content pertaining to the issues with migration file generation:

```
django/db/migrations/migration.py:Migration
```

This file appears to be central to the migration class itself, which is more relevant to understanding the imports in migration files. While this file may not specifically contain logic for writing the files, it is connected to migration management and might be a starting point for tracing where import logic is handled. 

The other file paths provided mainly contain test migrations, which are less likely to be relevant to fixing the import ordering issue.

Thus, concentrating on the core migration logic is essential, especially within the Django package responsible for migrations. Let's proceed with the relevant entry identified above.

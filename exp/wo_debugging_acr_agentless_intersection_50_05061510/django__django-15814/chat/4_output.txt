**Patch Review:**

The patch modifies the `django/db/models/sql/query.py` file to change the way metadata is accessed for proxy models. Specifically, it changes:
```python
opts = cur_model._meta
```
to:
```python
opts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta
```

This solves the problem by ensuring that the query correctly uses metadata from the actual concrete model, not the proxy model, which is necessary to handle related fields correctly when using `select_related()` and `only()`.

**Test Output Analysis:**

Before the patch:
- The test produces a `ModuleNotFoundError` because the `your_project` settings are not properly configured. This prevents the reproduction of the crash related to the issue.

After the patch:
- The `ModuleNotFoundError` persists, indicating there is still an issue with the test setup due to incorrect Django project configuration (missing `your_project` module). Therefore, it's impossible to determine a change in behavior regarding the original crash (related to `QuerySet.only()` and `select_related()`).

**Conclusion:**

Because the test fails to run due to a configuration issue unrelated to the original bug, it's impossible to ascertain whether the patch addresses the issue without correcting the test environment setup. Therefore, the resolution of the original issue in terms of runtime behavior cannot be validated solely based on the given output.

Issue resolved: `False`

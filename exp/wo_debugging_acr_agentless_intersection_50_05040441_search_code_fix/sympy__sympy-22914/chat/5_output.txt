To resolve the issue of adding support for the `Min` and `Max` functions in the `PythonCodePrinter` class within the SymPy library, we need to insert the `_print_Min` and `_print_Max` methods into the class `PythonCodePrinter`. Given the existing partial code from `sympy/printing/pycode.py`, let's create a patch in the *SEARCH/REPLACE* format to incorporate these methods.

Here's the patch:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/printing/pycode.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    def _print_Half(self, expr):\n=======\n    def _print_Half(self, expr):\n\n    def _print_Min(self, expr):\n        return \"min({})\".format(\", \".join(self._print(arg) for arg in expr.args))\n\n    def _print_Max(self, expr):\n        return \"max({})\".format(\", \".join(self._print(arg) for arg in expr.args))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation:

- **File Path**: `sympy/printing/pycode.py`
- **Search Block**: The search block indicates the current position in the file. We insert right after the `_print_Half` method based on the partial class implementation provided.
- **Replace Block**: Adds the new methods `_print_Min` and `_print_Max`, implementing logic to handle `Min` and `Max` functions in Python code generation.

This patch should properly integrate the required functionality for printing `Min` and `Max` functions as requested. Ensure that after applying the patch, relevant tests are run to confirm the functionality and no side effects are introduced.

To address the issue, we need to explore the `_delete_composed_index` method within the `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` file as mentioned in the error message. This method seems to be where the deletion of constraints, specifically for `index_together`, is causing issues due to a mismatch in constraint counts.

We'll look for the `_delete_composed_index` method first to understand its current implementation and then determine how to patch it.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "_delete_composed_index")
```

To determine whether the issue is resolved, let's analyze the details provided:

1. **Original Issue Summary**: The problem occurs because `_pytest.capture.EncodedFile` advertises a mode of `rb+`, which is interpreted as binary. This causes an exception when `youtube_dl` writes bytes to pytest captured output, expecting text mode instead.

2. **Provided Patch**: The patch modifies the `__getattr__` method within `src/_pytest/capture.py` to override the behavior when the `mode` attribute is accessed. It removes 'b' from the mode string before returning it, while leaving the behavior for other attributes unchanged.

3. **Reproduce Test**: The test involves calling `ydl.to_screen("Test message")`. It does not directly test the writing of bytes, which is a part of the original issue. This test seems insufficient for verifying whether bytes can now be written without causing a `TypeError`.

4. **Test Output Before and After Patch**: Both show `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'youtube_dl'`, indicating that the environment in which the test is running does not have `youtube_dl` installed, preventing the test from executing any further.

Given these observations, we can't confirm if the patch resolves the issue because:

- The patch test output is incomplete due to a missing module, making it impossible to verify if the change correctly handles bytes being written.
- The patch explanation sounds plausible for addressing the perceived `text` vs `binary` mode issue, but without an appropriate environment and test validation, its efficacy remains unconfirmed.

Therefore, based on the current information available:
Issue resolved: `False`

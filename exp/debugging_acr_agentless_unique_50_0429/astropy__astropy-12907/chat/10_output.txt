Based on the information retrieved, I have the necessary source code of the `_cstack` method which is central to addressing the issue with separability matrix calculations for nested compound models. The problem appears to be related to how matrices are constructed and populated within `_cstack`, specifically affecting nested compound model behaviors when operations like `&` are used.

With the source code of `_cstack` in hand, I'm ready to proceed with generating a patch to correct how the separability matrix handles nested models.

Ready generation: `True`

To resolve the issue, we need to modify the behavior when an expression is multiplied by a `Poly`. Specifically, the problem lies in the `Expr.__mul__` method, which simply returns `Mul(self, other)`, causing the `Poly` not to evaluate when it's on the right side of the multiplication.

Before generating a patch, I need to obtain the source code of the `Expr.__mul__` method to determine how best to handle the case when the other operand is a `Poly`.

Let's retrieve the source code for `Expr.__mul__` method:

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/core/expr.py", "Expr.__mul__")
```

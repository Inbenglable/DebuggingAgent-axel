To address the issue, I need to retrieve the source code for the `minimal_blocks` method within the `PermutationGroup` class found in the `sympy/combinatorics/perm_groups.py` file. This will help confirm the necessary changes required to resolve the issue.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/perm_groups.py", "PermutationGroup.minimal_blocks")
```

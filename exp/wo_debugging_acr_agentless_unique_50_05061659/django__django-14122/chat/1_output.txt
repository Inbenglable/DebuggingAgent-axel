To address the issue described, I need to inspect the relevant code handling the ordering and grouping behavior in Django queries. This typically involves the QuerySet and SQL compiler modules. Since I need to inspect how the Meta.ordering fields are included in the GROUP BY clause, it's essential to examine the parts of the codebase responsible for query compilation. Specifically, I'll look at how Django processes ordering fields in QuerySets and compiles SQL statements.

I'll start by searching for classes and methods related to compiling SQL queries because they would include the logic where ordering might unintentionally affect GROUP BY clauses.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("compile")
search_class_in_codebase("SQLCompiler")
search_method_in_codebase("get_ordering")
```

To fix the issue where `autodoc` is not respecting an empty `__all__` attribute, we need to modify the logic in the `filter_members` method. This method is responsible for filtering which members of a module are documented by `autodoc`.

The current implementation checks whether a member is to be kept based on being explicitly specified or if the `want_all` flag is set. We need to adjust the logic to account for an explicitly empty `__all__` list, meaning that no members should be included in the documentation.

Based on the information, the `Documenter.filter_members` method appears to be the right place to make changes. We should check the `__all__` attribute if it exists and is empty, and ensure no members are documented in this case.

Code retrieval is not necessary beyond what we've already seen since we have the relevant parts needed to understand and modify the logic. Therefore, I am ready to proceed with creating a patch.

Ready generation: `True`

Based on the issue described, the bug arises from the inconsistency in the argument naming between the `integrate` method of `DataArray` and `Dataset`. The trace indicates a `TypeError` due to using `coord` as an argument for `DataArray.integrate`, which expects `dim`. 

The traceback reveals that the error occurs when calling `da.integrate(coord='x')` in the `main` method of the test script `reproduce.py`. The root cause of the error lies in the argument handling within the implementation of `DataArray.integrate`.

To understand why `DataArray.integrate` accepts 'dim' instead of 'coord', we need to inspect the method's current implementation.

Since the error arises from the `DataArray.integrate` method, the next step is to observe its implementation.

Observed method: `xarray/core/dataarray.py:DataArray.integrate`

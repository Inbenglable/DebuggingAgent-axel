Based on the information gathered, I have identified the relevant components related to the SQLite migration issue concerning the addition of nullable `OneToOneField`. The `_remake_table` method is crucial in the `DatabaseSchemaEditor` class, as it handles table modifications when schema changes cannot be managed directly with an `ALTER TABLE` statement. This may involve copying data to a new table.

I should review the `_remake_table` method's implementation to understand how it works and if any adjustments are necessary to handle nullable unique fields appropriately. I will retrieve the code for `_remake_table`.

Let's proceed with the code retrieval:

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py", "DatabaseSchemaEditor._remake_table")
```

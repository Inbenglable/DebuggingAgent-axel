To fix the issue mentioned, I will ensure that the variable `kern` is initialized before it is potentially referenced inside the `kernS` function. Here's the patch in the required SEARCH/REPLACE format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/core/sympify.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    hit = False\n    quoted = '\"' in s or \"'\" in s\n    if '(' in s and not quoted:\n=======\n    hit = False\n    kern = ''\n    quoted = '\"' in s or \"'\" in s\n    if '(' in s and not quoted:\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization of `kern`:** The `kern` variable is initialized with an empty string `''` before the condition where it is assigned a value. This ensures it is defined before any potential use.

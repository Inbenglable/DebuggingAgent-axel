Analyzing the issue:

The problem arises in the `ManifestStaticFilesStorage` class, specifically within the `post_process` method. The traceback points to the variable `substitutions` being referenced before assignment due to the condition `if substitutions:` in this method when the loop that initializes `substitutions` isn't entered because `max_post_process_passes` is set to 0.

The code for `ManifestFilesMixin.post_process` shows that it overrides `post_process` to initialize `hashed_files` and call the `post_process` method from the superclass using `yield from super().post_process(*args, **kwargs)`. However, the details are not sufficient to directly identify the exact point of failure related to `substitutions`.

Analyzing the traceback, the root cause seems to be associated with the handling of `max_post_process_passes` inside `post_process` and any conditional logic that requires this variable to be initialized.

Based on the issue description and provided traces, I need more context from the lines that deal with substitutions inside the method where the error is occurring, as well as understanding any related loop structures that depend on `max_post_process_passes`.

I will proceed with observing the scope within `ManifestStaticFilesStorage.post_process` where the `substitutions` variable is being dealt with:

Observed scope: `django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py:246-257`

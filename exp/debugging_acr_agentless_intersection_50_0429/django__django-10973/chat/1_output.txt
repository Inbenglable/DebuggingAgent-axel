The error traceback in the observed code snippet points out that the `sys` module is not defined while trying to insert the test app into the Python path. This indicates an issue in the script `run_debugging_test.py`, which is not directly related to the described issue of using `subprocess.run` with `PGPASSWORD`.

The primary issue described is regarding the PostgreSQL backend in Django, specifically the method or functionality that runs the PostgreSQL shell command. The test description with `DatabaseClient.runshell_db(conn_params)` suggests this is the method of interest.

Hence, to trace the relevant code involved in the issue described, I will focus on where `runshell_db` is implemented and observe its behavior.

Observed method: `django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py:DatabaseClient.runshell_db`

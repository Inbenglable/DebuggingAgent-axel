Now You need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
UsernameValidator allows trailing newline in usernames
Description
	
ASCIIUsernameValidator and UnicodeUsernameValidator use the regex 
r'^[\w.@+-]+$'
The intent is to only allow alphanumeric characters as well as ., @, +, and -. However, a little known quirk of Python regexes is that $ will also match a trailing newline. Therefore, the user name validators will accept usernames which end with a newline. You can avoid this behavior by instead using \A and \Z to terminate regexes. For example, the validator regex could be changed to
r'\A[\w.@+-]+\Z'
in order to reject usernames that end with a newline.
I am not sure how to officially post a patch, but the required change is trivial - using the regex above in the two validators in contrib.auth.validators.

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
The observed output shows a `NameError` related to the `sys` module, which indicates that `sys` is not imported in the `run_debugging_test.py` file. This error prevents the script from properly running the test, and consequently, it does not address the original regex issue described in the Django validators.

To fix this, we first need to allow the test to run by importing `sys` in the debugging script. The original issue in the Django `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` is a mismatch in the regex pattern, where `$` should be replaced with `\Z` to avoid accepting usernames with trailing newlines.

Since we need to resolve the import issue first in the test script, and then check the regex in the Django validators, the next steps would be:

1. Ensure that `sys` is imported in the `run_debugging_test.py` script to address the immediate runtime error.
2. Re-run the test to see if it catches the problematic regex.
3. If the test runs correctly, address the faulty regex in the Django validators.

For now, I'll focus on fixing the immediate `NameError` issue before dealing with the regular expressions inside django.contrib.auth.validators.

Observed method: `run_debugging_test.py:debugging_test_execution_wrapper`
==================================================
Based on the provided information, the runtime error message indicates a `NameError` for the `sys` module in the `run_debugging_test.py` file. This error occurs because the `sys` module is utilized within the method `debugging_test_execution_wrapper`, but it hasn't been imported at the beginning of the script. The error is preventing the script from running and testing the original issue with the Django validators.

The fixing process should be tackled in two steps:
1. Import `sys` at the beginning of the `run_debugging_test.py` file to resolve the immediate `NameError`.
2. Once the test runs correctly, if the test reveals issues with the regex, update the regex pattern in Django's `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` as originally noted.

However, in this particular case, we should first analyze and fix the `NameError` to allow the script to execute and run the tests on the validators.

Since the runtime error appears specifically because the `sys` module is not imported, we can quickly identify this as the stopping point for the issue:

Buggy method: `run_debugging_test.py:debugging_test_execution_wrapper`

To resolve this issue, ensure that the `sys` module is imported at the top of the `run_debugging_test.py` script. Once the `NameError` is fixed, rerun the script to see if it propagates any new errors or outputs related to the original regex validator issue.
==================================================

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To generate the patch, I need to modify the `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator`. I will need to retrieve the relevant source code for these validators to update the regex patterns. I'll proceed by searching for these two validators in the Django codebase to understand their implementation.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ASCIIUsernameValidator")
search_class_in_codebase("UnicodeUsernameValidator")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_class_in_codebase("ASCIIUsernameValidator")
RESULT:
#### django/contrib/auth/validators.py:ASCIIUsernameValidator
```python
class ASCIIUsernameValidator(validators.RegexValidator):
    regex = r'^[\w.@+-]+$'
    message = _(
        'Enter a valid username. This value may contain only English letters, '
        'numbers, and @/./+/-/_ characters.'
    )
    flags = re.ASCII
```


### API INVOKE: search_class_in_codebase("UnicodeUsernameValidator")
RESULT:
#### django/contrib/auth/validators.py:UnicodeUsernameValidator
```python
class UnicodeUsernameValidator(validators.RegexValidator):
    regex = r'^[\w.@+-]+$'
    message = _(
        'Enter a valid username. This value may contain only letters, '
        'numbers, and @/./+/-/_ characters.'
    )
    flags = 0
```


==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

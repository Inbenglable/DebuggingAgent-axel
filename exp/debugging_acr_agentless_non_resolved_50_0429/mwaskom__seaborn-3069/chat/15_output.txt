### Patch Review

The patch provided seems to attempt changes in two areas within the `Plotter._finalize_figure` method:

1. **Tick Mark Offsets**: The patch includes logic to check if the scale for a given axis is `Nominal`. If it is, it adjusts the axis limits by +/- 0.5.

2. **Axis Inversion**: The patch includes logic to check if the y-axis scale is `Nominal` and, if so, inverts the y-axis.

### Analysis of Test Output

#### Original Output
The test outputs an error indicating that the nominal scale is not drawn to +/- 0.5 from the first and last tick:

```
AssertionError: Nominal scale is not drawn to +/- 0.5 from the first and last tick
```

#### Patched Output
After the patch is applied, the test produces the same error as before:

```
AssertionError: Nominal scale is not drawn to +/- 0.5 from the first and last tick
```

### Conclusion

The patch does not resolve the issue according to the provided test case. The test still fails at the check for nominal scale tick drawing, indicating the bug related to tick mark offsets remains unresolved. The exception and error message remain unchanged after applying the patch, suggesting no effective fix was applied for the particular check concerning axis limit adjustments.

Issue resolved: `False`

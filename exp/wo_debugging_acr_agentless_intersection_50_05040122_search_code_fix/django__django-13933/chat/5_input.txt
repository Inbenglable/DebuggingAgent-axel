ModelChoiceField does not provide value of invalid choice when raising ValidationError
Description
	 
		(last modified by Aaron Wiegel)
	 
Compared with ChoiceField and others, ModelChoiceField does not show the value of the invalid choice when raising a validation error. Passing in parameters with the invalid value and modifying the default error message for the code invalid_choice should fix this.
From source code:
class ModelMultipleChoiceField(ModelChoiceField):
	"""A MultipleChoiceField whose choices are a model QuerySet."""
	widget = SelectMultiple
	hidden_widget = MultipleHiddenInput
	default_error_messages = {
		'invalid_list': _('Enter a list of values.'),
		'invalid_choice': _('Select a valid choice. %(value)s is not one of the'
							' available choices.'),
		'invalid_pk_value': _('“%(pk)s” is not a valid value.')
	}
	...
class ModelChoiceField(ChoiceField):
	"""A ChoiceField whose choices are a model QuerySet."""
	# This class is a subclass of ChoiceField for purity, but it doesn't
	# actually use any of ChoiceField's implementation.
	default_error_messages = {
		'invalid_choice': _('Select a valid choice. That choice is not one of'
							' the available choices.'),
	}
	...

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue where the `ModelChoiceField` does not provide the value of the invalid choice when raising a `ValidationError`, I need to modify the error message format or the portion of code where the error is raised to include the invalid choice value.

Before generating the patch, I need to retrieve the source code for the `ModelChoiceField` class to understand where and how the `ValidationError` is being raised and what modifications would be necessary.

Given that I need the source code for `ModelChoiceField`, I will search for this class in the codebase for Django.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ModelChoiceField")
```

==================================================

Your Output:
To resolve the issue, I need to find where the `ValidationError` is being raised in the `ModelChoiceField` class, particularly focusing on the `validate` method, as this is likely where the error occurs. I'll retrieve the source code for this specific method from the `django/forms/models.py` file to understand how the error message can be modified to include the invalid choice value.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/forms/models.py", "ModelChoiceField.validate")

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

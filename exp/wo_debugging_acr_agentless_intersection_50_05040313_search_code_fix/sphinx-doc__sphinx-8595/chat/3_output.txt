I need to retrieve more source code to understand how the `__all__` attribute is processed by the `autodoc` extension of Sphinx. In particular, I need to examine the implementation that handles module member extraction and any existing conditions involving the `__all__` attribute.

I will start by searching for methods in the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` extension that might interact with module attributes, particularly those involving `__all__`.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("process_docstring")
search_method_in_codebase("get_object_members")
```

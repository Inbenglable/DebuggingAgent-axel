To resolve the issue, I need to review the implementation of the `_delete_composed_index` method in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`, as this is where the error occurs when handling the deletion of an index. Here's what I'll do to obtain the necessary code to generate a patch:

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "_delete_composed_index")
```

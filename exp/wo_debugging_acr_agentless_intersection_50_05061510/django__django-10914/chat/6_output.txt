Let's go through the relevant information:

1. **Issue Description**:
   - The issue relates to inconsistent file permissions for uploaded files when using Django's `FileSystemStorage`.
   - Specifically, the expected permissions are `0o644`, but the resulting permissions were `0o600` due to how temporary files are handled.

2. **Reproduce Test Analysis**:
   - The reproducible test is designed to check the permissions of files uploaded via `InMemoryUploadedFile` and `TemporaryUploadedFile`.
   - Before the patch, the test fails with an `AssertionError` indicating the permissions are `0o600` instead of `0o644`.

3. **Patch Analysis**:
   - The patch modifies the constructor of the `FileSystemStorage` class in Django's `django/core/files/storage.py` file.
   - Specifically, the default `file_permissions_mode` is changed to `0o644`.

4. **Patched Output Analysis**:
   - After applying the patch, the test output indicates that the file permissions are as expected (`0o644`).
   - The test no longer fails with an `AssertionError`, suggesting the permissions issue has been addressed.
   - The remaining exception related to `FileNotFoundError` for a temporary file is noted but doesn't seem directly related to the permissions issue.

Conclusion based on the patch and the test outputs:

- The patch effectively sets the default file permissions for uploaded files to `0o644`, addressing the reported inconsistency.
- The test confirms that the fix now produces the expected permissions for both MemoryUploadedFile and TemporaryUploadedFile scenarios.

Issue resolved: `True`

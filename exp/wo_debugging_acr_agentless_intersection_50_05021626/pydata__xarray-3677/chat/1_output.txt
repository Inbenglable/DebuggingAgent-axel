To resolve the issue, I need to look into the `ds.merge()` method and how it is implemented. From the error traceback, it seems that the issue arises in the `merge(ds, da)` method call. To proceed, I will search for the relevant methods and classes in the codebase.

The error traceback mentions the following files and methods:
- `dataset_merge_method` in `xarray/core/merge.py`
- `merge_core` in `xarray/core/merge.py`
- `coerce_pandas_values` in `xarray/core/merge.py`

Additionally, I need to look at the implementation of the `merge` method in the `Dataset` class in `xarray/core/dataset.py`.

Let's search these methods and classes in the codebase:

```python
search_method_in_file("xarray/core/merge.py", "dataset_merge_method")
search_method_in_file("xarray/core/merge.py", "merge_core")
search_method_in_file("xarray/core/merge.py", "coerce_pandas_values")
search_method_in_codebase("Dataset.merge")
search_class_in_file("xarray/core/dataset.py", "Dataset")
```

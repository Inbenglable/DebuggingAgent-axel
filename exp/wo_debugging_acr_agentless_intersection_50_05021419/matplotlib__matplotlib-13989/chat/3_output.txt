The issue described is in the implementation of the `hist` function when using both the `density=True` parameter and a specified `range`. As per the code available, the issue likely stems from how `density` and possibly range are being handled together in the `Axes.hist` function in `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py`.

I've already obtained the full source code for the relevant `hist` method, which is where the core computation logic for the histogram resides. This means I should have enough information to proceed with generating a patch. The goal of the patch would be to ensure that when `density=True` is specified, the `range` parameter is correctly applied so that the bins include the specified range endpoints. 

I will now generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

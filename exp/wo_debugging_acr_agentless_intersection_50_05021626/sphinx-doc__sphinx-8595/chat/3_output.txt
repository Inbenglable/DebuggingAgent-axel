Based on the retrieved information, the `Documenter` class in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` seems to be responsible for determining which members to document, particularly through methods like `get_object_members` and `filter_members`. To fix the issue of ignoring an empty `__all__` attribute, I need to locate these methods and understand their implementation. This will help in making the necessary adjustments to the filtering logic.

Let's retrieve the source code of these methods to generate the patch.

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py", "Documenter.get_object_members")
search_method_in_file("sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py", "Documenter.filter_members")
```

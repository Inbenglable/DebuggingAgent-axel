To address the issue of optimizing migration operations for `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex`, I will need to focus on refining redundant or unnecessary operations during migrations. I have retrieved the necessary methodsâ€”`database_forwards` and `database_backwards` for both `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex`. These methods are responsible for handling index operations in the database.

Analyzing these methods, I can now think about implementing optimizations. However, before applying any patch, I need to consider the overall code context where these methods might be invoked and any related dependencies or constraints in their usage. This may involve understanding conditions under which these operations could be avoided.

I will now proceed with generating the patch by refining the methods with the gathered source code to address the redundancy in index operations.

Ready generation: `True`

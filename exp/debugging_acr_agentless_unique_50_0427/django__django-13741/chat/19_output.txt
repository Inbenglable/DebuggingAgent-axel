To address the issue of setting the `disabled` attribute to `True` by default in the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField`, we will modify the `__init__` method within the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` class in the `django/contrib/auth/forms.py` file. Here is the code change needed for the patch:

```python
### django/contrib/auth/forms.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        ...
=======
        kwargs.setdefault("disabled", True)
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

By making this change, we ensure that the field is disabled by default, thereby preventing accidental changes while displaying the password hash.

Here is the JSON format of the patch:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/auth/forms.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        ...\n=======\n        kwargs.setdefault(\"disabled\", True)\n        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch ensures that the `disabled` attribute is set to `True`, addressing the issue outlined, while preserving existing functionality by executing the superclass initializer as before.

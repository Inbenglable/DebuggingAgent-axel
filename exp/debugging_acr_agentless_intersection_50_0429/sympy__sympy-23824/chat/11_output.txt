To fix the issue, we need to adjust the handling of uncontracted leading gamma matrices in the `kahane_simplify` function. The key problem is with prepending these matrices in the correct order into `resulting_indices`. Specifically, the section where `prepend_indices` is inserted reverses the order currently, which we need to correct.

Let's generate the patch to address the problem:

```python
### sympy/physics/hep/gamma_matrices.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        prepend_indices.insert(0, free_pos[pointer])
=======
        prepend_indices.append(free_pos[pointer])
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that `prepend_indices` accumulates in the natural order as they appear, rather than reversing them by using `insert(0, ...)`. We should verify that this fix aligns with the expected behavior mentioned in the issue details and does not introduce any further errors in the function's operation.

Here's the resulting JSON format with the patch included:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/physics/hep/gamma_matrices.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        prepend_indices.insert(0, free_pos[pointer])\n=======\n        prepend_indices.append(free_pos[pointer])\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

The issue is not resolved based on the provided information. Let's break down the findings:

1. **Original Output Analysis**:
   - The error `django.db.utils.OperationalError: no such table: __main___timeslots` indicates that the `TimeSlots` table does not exist, which is a database setup issue.

2. **Patch Applied**:
   - The patch aims to modify the `as_sql` method in the `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` classes to properly use the `tzinfo` parameter if provided, falling back to the current behavior if `tzinfo` is not provided.

3. **Patched Output Analysis**:
   - After applying the patch, the test still fails with the same error: `django.db.utils.OperationalError: no such table: __main___timeslots`. This means the table creation or migration steps were not executed correctly.
   
Given that the error before and after the patch remains the same and is related to missing database table creation, the test never actually ran the code paths involving `TruncDate` or `TruncTime` with the applied patch, as it failed prior.

Therefore, the primary issue with the database table needs to be addressed before evaluating whether the patch fixes the functionality. The patch itself can't be fully evaluated because the precondition—having a proper database setup—is not met, which prevents the execution of the code paths that the patch modifies.

Issue resolved: `False`

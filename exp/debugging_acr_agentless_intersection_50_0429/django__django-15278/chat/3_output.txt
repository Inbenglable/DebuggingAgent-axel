To resolve the issue, it seems I need to inspect the relevant migration file where the `migrations.AddField(...)` operation is defined. I need to see the full context around this line of code to confirm what changes are necessary.

Thus, I should search for the relevant migration code to ensure I have the necessary information. Since I don't have the exact file path, I'll search for the migration function in the codebase.

```python
search_code_in_codebase("migrations.AddField")
```

To resolve this issue, I need to locate and analyze the source code for the `combine_by_coords` function within the xarray project. This will allow me to understand where and how the function enforces monotonicity on coordinates. Since I don't know the file path, I will search for the method in the entire codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("combine_by_coords")
```

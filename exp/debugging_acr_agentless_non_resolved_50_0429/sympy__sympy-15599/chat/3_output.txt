The abnormal behavior of the program is that `Mod(3*i, 2)` is not being simplified to `Mod(i, 2)` as expected. In SymPy, the `Mod` function does not automatically perform algebraic simplifications. The logic to perform such simplifications must be explicitly added to the method handling the `Mod` operation.

Given the hint from the issue description, the suspected area of the code is within the `doit` method of the `Mod` class located in `sympy/core/mod.py`. This will likely be where we need to address simplifications for combinations of expressions involving imaginary numbers and modulus operations.

To proceed with tracing the code, I will observe this method further for the logic related to simplification in the `Mod` function execution:

Observed method: `sympy/core/mod.py:doit`

Now You need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Make the element_id argument of json_script optional
Description
	
I recently had a use-case where I wanted to use json_script but I didn't need any id for it (I was including the <script> inside a <template> so I didn't need an id to refer to it).
I can't see any reason (security or otherwise) for the id to be required and making it optional doesn't seem to break any tests.

</ISSUE>


You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue, I need to look at the source code of the `json_script` function to understand its current implementation and how the `element_id` argument is being used. This will help in making the argument optional. Let's start by searching for the `json_script` method in the Django codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("json_script")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("json_script")
RESULT:
#### django/utils/html.py:json_script
```python
def json_script(value, element_id):
    """
    Escape all the HTML/XML special characters with their unicode escapes, so
    value is safe to be output anywhere except for inside a tag attribute. Wrap
    the escaped JSON in a script tag.
    """
    from django.core.serializers.json import DjangoJSONEncoder
    json_str = json.dumps(value, cls=DjangoJSONEncoder).translate(_json_script_escapes)
    return format_html(
        '<script id="{}" type="application/json">{}</script>',
        element_id, mark_safe(json_str)
    )

```


==================================================

Your Output:
Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

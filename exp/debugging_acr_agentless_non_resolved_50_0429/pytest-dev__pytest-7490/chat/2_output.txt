Upon analyzing the observed behavior and the related code, the issue appears to arise when attempting to dynamically add an xfail marker in Pytest version 6, where it previously worked in version 5. The traceback indicates that there is an issue with file path resolution during the test execution as shown by this line from the traceback:

```
_pytest.config.exceptions.UsageError: file not found: reproducer.py::test_xfail_test
```

The issue is not directly related to the behavior of the test case but rather seem to be related to the way the path for the test file is being processed:

```
'x', 'reproducer.py::test_xfail_test'
```

This error suggests that the test runner cannot locate the specified test, which means the input to `pytest.main()` might need to be revised to correctly specify the test file, or there might be an issue with how the path is determined.

To identify the root cause, let's first examine the method responsible for locating and loading test paths in the pytests. Since the error points to `_prepareconfig` not resolving paths correctly, I will inspect that method.

Observed method: `src/_pytest/config/__init__.py:_prepareconfig`

Based on the information retrieved, we have the source code for the `fit_predict` and `predict` methods from the `BaseMixture` class, which is inherited by the `GaussianMixture` class. The issue arises when the `n_init` parameter is greater than 1, causing `fit_predict` and `predict` to give different results. 

The `fit_predict` method computes the E-step again after setting the best parameters to ensure consistency with `predict`, which is likely not being used effectively when `n_init > 1`.

I have enough information to generate a patch and address the consistency discrepancy between the `fit_predict` and `predict` methods. 

Ready generation: `True`

Now You need to reolve the following issue in the **sympy** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
SI._collect_factor_and_dimension() cannot properly detect that exponent is dimensionless
How to reproduce:

```python
from sympy import exp
from sympy.physics import units
from sympy.physics.units.systems.si import SI

expr = units.second / (units.ohm * units.farad)
dim = SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(expr)[1]

assert SI.get_dimension_system().is_dimensionless(dim)

buggy_expr = 100 + exp(expr)
SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(buggy_expr)

# results in ValueError: Dimension of "exp(second/(farad*ohm))" is Dimension(time/(capacitance*impedance)), but it should be Dimension(1)
```

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
Based on the issue description, I need to review the source code for the method `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension()` to understand how dimensions are calculated and identify why the method is not properly detecting that the exponent is dimensionless. 

Since the method belongs to the `SI` class and I don't have the file path, I will start by searching for the method within the codebase to locate the file and then retrieve its implementation.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("SI._collect_factor_and_dimension")
```

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

To address the issue of exposing the `warm_start` parameter in the `IsolationForest` class, I need to:

1. Modify the `IsolationForest` class to include `warm_start` in its `__init__()` method.
2. Update the documentation to describe the `warm_start` functionality similarly to its description in `RandomForestClassifier`.
3. Implement a test to validate the warm start behavior in `IsolationForest`.

Given the code for the `IsolationForest` class, the next step is to inspect its `__init__` method to correctly integrate and document the `warm_start` parameter. Thus, I will retrieve the `__init__` method from `sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py`.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py", "IsolationForest.__init__")
```

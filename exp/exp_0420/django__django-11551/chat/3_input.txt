Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
#### ISSUE
admin.E108 is raised on fields accessible only via instance.
Description
	 
		(last modified by ajcsimons)
	 
As part of startup django validates the ModelAdmin's list_display list/tuple for correctness (django.admin.contrib.checks._check_list_display). Having upgraded django from 2.07 to 2.2.1 I found that a ModelAdmin with a list display that used to pass the checks and work fine in admin now fails validation, preventing django from starting. A PositionField from the django-positions library triggers this bug, explanation why follows.
from django.db import models
from position.Fields import PositionField
class Thing(models.Model)
 number = models.IntegerField(default=0)
 order = PositionField()
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Thing
@admin.register(Thing)
class ThingAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin)
 list_display = ['number', 'order']
Under 2.2.1 this raises an incorrect admin.E108 message saying "The value of list_display[1] refers to 'order' which is not a callable...".
Under 2.0.7 django starts up successfully.
If you change 'number' to 'no_number' or 'order' to 'no_order' then the validation correctly complains about those.
The reason for this bug is commit ​https://github.com/django/django/commit/47016adbf54b54143d4cf052eeb29fc72d27e6b1 which was proposed and accepted as a fix for bug https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/28490. The problem is while it fixed that bug it broke the functionality of _check_list_display_item in other cases. The rationale for that change was that after field=getattr(model, item) field could be None if item was a descriptor returning None, but subsequent code incorrectly interpreted field being None as meaning getattr raised an AttributeError. As this was done after trying field = model._meta.get_field(item) and that failing that meant the validation error should be returned. However, after the above change if hasattr(model, item) is false then we no longer even try field = model._meta.get_field(item) before returning an error. The reason hasattr(model, item) is false in the case of a PositionField is its get method throws an exception if called on an instance of the PositionField class on the Thing model class, rather than a Thing instance.
For clarity, here are the various logical tests that _check_list_display_item needs to deal with and the behaviour before the above change, after it, and the correct behaviour (which my suggested patch exhibits). Note this is assuming the first 2 tests callable(item) and hasattr(obj, item) are both false (corresponding to item is an actual function/lambda rather than string or an attribute of ThingAdmin).
hasattr(model, item) returns True or False (which is the same as seeing if getattr(model, item) raises AttributeError)
model._meta.get_field(item) returns a field or raises FieldDoesNotExist
Get a field from somewhere, could either be from getattr(model,item) if hasattr was True or from get_field.
Is that field an instance of ManyToManyField?
Is that field None? (True in case of bug 28490)
 hasattr get_field field is None? field ManyToMany? 2.0 returns 2.2 returns Correct behaviour Comments 
 True ok False False [] [] [] - 
 True ok False True E109 E109 E109 - 
 True ok True False E108 [] [] good bit of 28490 fix, 2.0 was wrong 
 True raises False False [] [] [] - 
 True raises False True E109 [] E109 Another bug introduced by 28490 fix, fails to check if ManyToMany in get_field raise case 
 True raises True False E108 [] [] good bit of 28490 fix, 2.0 was wrong 
 False ok False False [] E108 [] bad bit of 28490 fix, bug hit with PositionField 
 False ok False True [] E108 E109 both 2.0 and 2.2 wrong 
 False ok True False [] E108 [] bad 28490 fix 
 False raises False False E108 E108 E108 - 
 False raises False True E108 E108 E108 impossible condition, we got no field assigned to be a ManyToMany 
 False raises True False E108 E108 E108 impossible condition, we got no field assigned to be None 
The following code exhibits the correct behaviour in all cases. The key changes are there is no longer a check for hasattr(model, item), as that being false should not prevent us form attempting to get the field via get_field, and only return an E108 in the case both of them fail. If either of those means or procuring it are successful then we need to check if it's a ManyToMany. Whether or not the field is None is irrelevant, and behaviour is contained within the exception catching blocks that should cause it instead of signalled through a variable being set to None which is a source of conflation of different cases.

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
from django.conf import settings
from django.apps import apps
from django.db import models
from django.contrib import admin
from django.core.checks import run_checks
from django.contrib.admin.sites import site

settings.configure(
    DEBUG=True,
    INSTALLED_APPS=[
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.admin',
        'django.contrib.sessions',
        'django.contrib.messages',
        'test_app',  # Dummy app for testing
    ],
    DATABASES={'default': {'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3', 'NAME': ':memory:'}},
    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES=[],
)

apps.populate(settings.INSTALLED_APPS)

class Thing(models.Model):
    number = models.IntegerField(default=0)
    order = models.CharField(max_length=100)

    class Meta:
        app_label = 'test_app'

@admin.register(Thing)
class ThingAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ['number', 'order']

site.register(Thing, ThingAdmin)

admin_obj = ThingAdmin(Thing, site)

def run_debugging_checks():
    print("Checking if 'Thing' has 'order':", hasattr(Thing, 'order'))
    try:
        print("Getting 'Thing.order':", getattr(Thing, 'order'))
    except Exception as e:
        print("Error getting 'Thing.order':", str(e))

    errors = run_checks()
    if errors:
        print("Errors found during admin checks:")
        for error in errors:
            print(f"Error {error.id}: {error.msg}")
    else:
        print("No errors found during admin checks")

run_debugging_checks()



This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
The output indicates an issue when trying to populate the `INSTALLED_APPS` with `test_app`, which does not exist, leading to a `ModuleNotFoundError`. 

The key problem revolves around Django's admin checks for `list_display`, where certain fields are incorrectly flagged as errors in newer versions—specifically the `PositionField`. The provided code example for testing the admin E108 error isn't running correctly due to the missing `test_app`.

The notable points include:
- The use of `getattr` and `_meta.get_field` for validation in `_check_list_display_item`.
- The linked commit and rationale for change, which introduced a regression for certain field types due to the omitted `hasattr` checks and `get_field` dependency.

I need to review the `_check_list_display_item` logic, as the issue stems from there.

Next, I will trace through how Django validates fields in `list_display` for fields that aren't direct attributes of the model, focusing on how Django deals with fields like `PositionField`. This might occur in the `django/contrib/admin/checks.py` file, specifically within a method related to list display item checks.

Observed method: `django/contrib/admin/checks.py:_check_list_display_item`

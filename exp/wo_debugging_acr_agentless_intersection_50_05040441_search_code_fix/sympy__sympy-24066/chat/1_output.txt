To resolve the issue, we'll need to gather more information about the `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension()` method as well as the `exp()` function. Let me first identify the file where these might be implemented and then search for their source code.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("SI._collect_factor_and_dimension")
search_method_in_codebase("exp")
```

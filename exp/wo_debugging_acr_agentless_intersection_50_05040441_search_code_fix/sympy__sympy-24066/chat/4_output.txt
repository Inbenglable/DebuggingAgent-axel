The issue occurs when verifying if an exponent is dimensionless in the method `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension()`. This is causing the `exp()` function to raise a `ValueError`. The function `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension()` checks if the dimension of the exponent is dimensionless, but it seems that this functionality is not working correctly for the `exp()` function's arguments.

Before generating a patch, let's understand how dimensions are checked by looking at the implementation of `get_dimension_system`, which provides the dimension system for the SI unit system. This would help in understanding how dimensionless quantities are determined and how we might need to adjust our method.

To achieve this, I'll look for the implementation details of `SI.get_dimension_system()` to check the conditions under which dimensions are considered dimensionless.

Let's proceed with searching for the source code of `get_dimension_system`.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("UnitSystem.get_dimension_system")
```

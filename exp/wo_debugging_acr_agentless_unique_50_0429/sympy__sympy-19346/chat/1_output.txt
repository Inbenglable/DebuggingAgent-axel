To address the issue with the `srepr` not printing `dict` and `set` elements properly, I need to check the implementation of the `srepr` function. Given that this function is central to the issue, it is essential to verify it to understand how elements in different data structures are printed and modify it if necessary. First, I will search for the `srepr` function within the SymPy codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("srepr")
```

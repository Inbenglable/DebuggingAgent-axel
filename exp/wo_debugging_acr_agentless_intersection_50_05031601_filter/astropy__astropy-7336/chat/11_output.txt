To resolve the issue, I need to patch the handling of return annotations in the `quantity_input` decorator code. The likely modification will involve ensuring that constructors with a return type of `None` do not attempt to call `.to` on the return value.

I already have the problematic part located in `astropy/units/decorators.py`. It's time to gather the source code for the `quantity_input` method to understand its behavior fully before making any patch.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("quantity_input")
```

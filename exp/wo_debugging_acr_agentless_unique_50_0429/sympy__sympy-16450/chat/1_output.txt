To resolve the issue, I need to understand how the `posify` function works and how it processes assumptions. I will start by looking at the source code for the `posify` function within the SymPy project, as this will help me understand how the function manipulates assumptions and identify where to adjust the logic for preserving assumptions like `is_finite`.

Since the file path for the `posify` function isn't provided, I'll search for the method in the codebase to locate it.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("posify")
```

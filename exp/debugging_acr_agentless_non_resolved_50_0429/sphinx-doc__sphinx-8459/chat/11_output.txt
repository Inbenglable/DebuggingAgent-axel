To determine if the issue is resolved, let's carefully review the context and both the original and patched test outputs:

1. **Understanding the Issue and Patch:**
   - The issue relates to `autodoc_type_aliases` not properly working when `autodoc_typehints` is set to "description".
   - The patch attempts to modify the `format_signature` method to apply type aliases correctly during signature formatting.

2. **Review of Test Outputs:**
   - **Original Output:** The test fails due to a missing `sphinxarg` extension, resulting in an `ExtensionError`, and does not proceed to check the aliasing issue itself.
   - **Patched Output:** The same error persists, with the test again failing because of the missing `sphinxarg` extension.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The test did not reach the part where it could verify the functionality of `autodoc_type_aliases` due to the extension import error in both original and patched outputs.
   - The missing `sphinxarg` module is the actual cause of the test failure, unrelated to the specific issue around type aliasing.

Since the test can't proceed due to an unrelated module issue, it is impossible to determine from the given outputs whether the patch indeed resolves the original issue with `autodoc_type_aliases`. The environment problem must be addressed first to verify the bug fix.

**Conclusion:**
Issue resolved: `False`

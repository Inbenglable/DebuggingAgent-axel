Before generating the patch, we need to retrieve the source code of the `TruncBase` class, since `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` inherit from it, and check how `tzinfo` is handled. This will help us understand what changes need to be made.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncBase")
```

Based on the traceback provided in the test output, the error occurs in the `fit` method of the `OPTICS` class in `sklearn/cluster/optics_.py`. The relevant lines of code where the issue arises are:

```python
if min_samples <= 1:
    min_samples = max(2, min_samples * n_samples)  # Still a float
```

Subsequently, the `min_samples` parameter, which is expected to be an integer when instantiating the `NearestNeighbours` class, remains a float if it is calculated in this condition.

Error message indicates:
```plaintext
TypeError: n_neighbors does not take <class 'float'> value, enter integer value
```

This suggests that the float value of `min_samples` is not being converted to an integer before being used in the NearestNeighbours instantiation.

Thus, the issue is in the `OPTICS.fit` method in `optics_.py` file.

Buggy method: `sklearn/cluster/optics_.py:OPTICS.fit`

To address the issue mentioned, I need to examine the `timesince` function in the Django codebase. The goal is to understand how datetime objects are being handled in relation to timezone info and how the pivot datetime object is initialized.

Given the provided GitHub link, the file path likely relates to the `django/utils/timesince.py` file. Therefore, I'll begin by retrieving the source code for the `timesince` method within this file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/utils/timesince.py", "timesince")
```

In order to resolve this issue, I need to understand the implementation of the `post_process` method of the `ManifestStaticFilesStorage` class in the `django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py` file where the issue with the `substitutions` variable is happening. The information already retrieved shows the `post_process` method from `ManifestFilesMixin`, but I need to examine the context of the reported issue in `ManifestStaticFilesStorage`.

Therefore, I will retrieve the definition of the `ManifestStaticFilesStorage` class to locate the `post_process` method within the class.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py", "ManifestStaticFilesStorage")
```

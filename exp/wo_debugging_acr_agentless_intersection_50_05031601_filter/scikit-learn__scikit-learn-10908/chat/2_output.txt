To address the issue, we need to examine the `_check_vocabulary` method used in the `get_feature_names` method of the `CountVectorizer` class. This will help us understand the conditions under which the `NotFittedError` is raised. We should ensure that the error is not raised when a custom vocabulary is provided during initialization, even if the vectorizer has not been explicitly fitted with data.

I will retrieve the source code for the `_check_vocabulary` method to understand how it validates the vocabulary and raises the `NotFittedError`.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py", "_check_vocabulary")
```

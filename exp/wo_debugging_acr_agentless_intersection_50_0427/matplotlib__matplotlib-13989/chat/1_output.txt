To address the issue with `hist()` not respecting the `range` parameter when `density=True`, I need to investigate the `hist()` method within the Matplotlib codebase. This function resides in the `pyplot` module of Matplotlib, typically. Since I've not accessed the source code for this method yet, I'll search for it to understand how the `range` parameter is handled when `density=True`. Thus, I will use the appropriate API to locate its implementation.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("hist")
```

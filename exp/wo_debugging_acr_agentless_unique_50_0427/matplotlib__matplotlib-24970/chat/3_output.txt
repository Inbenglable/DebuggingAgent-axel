To address the deprecation warnings, it is important to understand where `xa`, `self._i_over`, `self._i_under`, and `self._i_bad` are defined and utilized within the class or method.

Given that we haven't yet identified the method or class within `colors.py` that contains these lines, it is necessary to search for these components. Therefore, let's proceed to search for the method or class that encompasses these lines of code.

```python
search_code_in_file("lib/matplotlib/colors.py", "xa = xa.astype(int)")

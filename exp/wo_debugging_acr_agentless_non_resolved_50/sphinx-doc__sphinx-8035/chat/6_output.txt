To implement the requested functionality, we need to modify the behavior of the `filter_members` method in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`. This involves adjusting how private members are processed to allow specifying individual private members, similar to the existing `:members:` option.

From the provided code, it appears the `filter_members` method is responsible for deciding which members should be included based on the options specified.

For the patch, the steps are:
1. Extend the logic in `filter_members` to handle specific private member names, similar to how it checks against `self.options.members`.
2. Update the configuration options to distinguish between including all private members and including specific private members.
3. Ensure this new behavior is correctly documented and follows existing patterns in the code for specific member handling.

Since I already have the code for `filter_members`, I'm ready to implement the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

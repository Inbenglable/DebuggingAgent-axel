To resolve the issue, I need to modify the code within the `only_relation_agnostic_fields` method of the `MigrationAutodetector` class to replace the line where `del deconstruction[2]['to']` occurs with `deconstruction[2].pop('to', None)`. This ensures that the test suite runs without encountering a `KeyError` when the 'to' key is absent.

Here is my plan to proceed:
- Locate the `only_relation_agnostic_fields` method within the `autodetector.py` file.
- Analyze the code to ensure that implementing the fix will not affect other functionalities.
- Update the code with the suggested change.

Let's find the source code for `only_relation_agnostic_fields` in the `autodetector.py` file. I need to search for the method within the file to view and make the necessary modifications.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/autodetector.py", "MigrationAutodetector.only_relation_agnostic_fields")
```

Squashed migration is not marked as unapplied
Description
	 
		(last modified by Markus Holtermann)
	 
When unapplying a squashed migration and the replaced migration files are still around, the MigrationExecutor mark the squash migration as unapplied, too, not only the replaced migrations.

</ISSUE>


A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
To analyze the abnormal program behavior and identify the bug in the Django project related to migration squashing, we need to trace through the code execution.

1. **Issue Description:**
   - The issue pertains to the undoing of a squashed migration, which inadvertently affects the status of the squashed migration itself along with the individual migrations it replaced.
   - The `MigrationExecutor` should be marking the squashed migration as unapplied when one of its replaced migrations is unapplied.

2. **Test Observation:**
   - The test script simulates the application and unappliance of a squashed migration.
   - The test output indicates that after unapplied both original migrations (`0001_initial` and `0002_change`), the squashed migration (`0001_squashed_0002`) remains marked as applied. This behavior is incorrect according to the intended functionality.

3. **Code Execution:**
   - During the execution, when the squashed migration is recorded as applied, it is correctly added to the migration record.
   - However, when one of its replaced migrations is unapplied, the squashed migration's applied status should also be revoked.

   The behavior suggests an issue in the migration graph construction or update mechanism.

To continue the trace and pinpoint the buggy behavior, the next step is to scrutinize the way unapplied migrations affect replacement registrations. Let's inspect the method that's responsible for handling unapplied migrations and graph updates.

**Next Method to Observe:**
Observed method: `django/db/migrations/loader.py:MigrationLoader.build_graph`
==================================================
### Analysis

The behavior observed in the test indicates that after unapplying both the replaced migrations (`0001_initial` and `0002_change`), the squashed migration (`0001_squashed_0002`) still remains marked as applied. The expected behavior is that the squashed migration should be marked as unapplied, since the migrations it was replacing are unapplied.

While analyzing the `MigrationLoader.build_graph` method, which constructs the migration dependency graph, we can see the handling of replacements at lines 237-247. Specifically:

- Lines 241-247 determine the applied status of replacement migrations. If all replacements are applied, the squashed migration is marked as applied. If not, it is removed from the applied migrations.
- Lines 248-256 decide whether a replacing migration should be used based on its replacement targets being all or none applied.

The issue seems to root in how unapplied migrations affect the replacement status. The logic on lines 241-247 needs to thoroughly ensure that whenever one of the replacement migrations is unapplied, the squashed migration should also be marked as unapplied.

Given the information:

### Next Steps

The issue likely requires further investigation of the logic handling the applied status updates based on the replacement migrations. A pertinent scope to observe would be lines handling conditional logic on replacements and their application status.

**Therefore, I would like to deeper observe:**

```python
Observed scope: django/db/migrations/loader.py:241-247
```
==================================================
The abnormal behavior observed in the runtime information confirms that the squashed migration remains marked as applied even after both of its replaced migrations are unapplied. This is inconsistent with the intended behavior, where a squashed migration should be marked as unapplied if any of the migrations it replaced are unapplied.

**Analysis of the Observed Code:**
- The logic at lines 241-247 in `MigrationLoader.build_graph` checks if all migrations listed under the `replaces` attribute of a migration are applied. If all are applied, it marks the squashed migration as applied. 
- The problem arises when one of the replaced migrations is unapplied; the squashed migration should be removed from the `applied_migrations`, but this isn't occurring in the output observed.

Based on the observation and analysis, it seems that the condition to remove the squashed migration from the `applied_migrations` is not executed after unapplying the replaced migrations.

**Identifying the Buggy Method and Code:**
The issue appears to be rooted in the way the `applied_migrations` dictionary is updated. In particular, the logic should also account for situations where a migration that is part of the `replaces` list is unapplied, thus necessitating the unapplication of the squashed migration.

Given the analysis, we have enough information to conclude that the bug is within the handling of unapplied migration updates inside the `build_graph` method. The method fails to remove the applied status of a squashed migration when any of its component migrations become unapplied.

Therefore, the buggy method is:

Buggy method: `django/db/migrations/loader.py:MigrationLoader.build_graph`

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

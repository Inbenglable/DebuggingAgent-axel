To address the issue, I'll need to access the `_sparse_fit` method source code first. This method might reside in a file that handles SVM or sparse data. I'll start by searching for the `_sparse_fit` method across the codebase to figure out its location and gather information about its context.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("_sparse_fit")
```

To resolve the issue, I need to investigate how the `autodoc_typehints_description_target` config option is currently implemented and how Napoleon interacts with this functionality. This will enable me to identify the potential clash or missing link between these two components.

First, I will retrieve the relevant source code related to the configuration of `autodoc_typehints_description_target` and its interaction with Napoleon.

```python
search_code_in_codebase("autodoc_typehints_description_target")
search_method_in_codebase("napoleon")
```

The issue seems to be related to how `_collect_factor_and_dimension()` handles dimensions for exponents, particularly when dealing with dimensionless quantities. I've identified a potential problem in the handling of Function expressions, where the function results might not be taking into account dimensionlessness correctly.

Before generating a patch, let's focus on checking the `Dimension.is_dimensionless()` implementation as it is central to determining dimensionless status within `_collect_factor_and_dimension()`. I need to ensure that this implementation accurately reflects dimensionlessness for different types of expressions. 

Let's search for the `Dimension.is_dimensionless()` method to understand its current logic.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("Dimension.is_dimensionless")
```

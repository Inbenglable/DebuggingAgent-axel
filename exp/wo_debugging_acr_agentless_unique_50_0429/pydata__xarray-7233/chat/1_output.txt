To address the issue, I need to understand how the `Coarsen.construct` method works within the xarray library to identify where the dimotion of non-dimensional coordinates to variables is occurring and subsequently fix it. Therefore, I will begin by locating the `Coarsen.construct` method in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("Coarsen.construct")
```

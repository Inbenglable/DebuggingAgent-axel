You need to trace the abnormal program to resolve project issues and submit pull requests.
Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **sphinx** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Support defining specific `:private-members:` for autodoc
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Currently, if I'm using autodoc, the `:private-members:` option does not allow specification of which private members to document. The current behavior is to document all private members, but what if I would only like to document 1 or 2?

**Describe the solution you'd like**
For `:private-members:` to take arguments, similarly to how `:members:` currently works

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
The current best way to do this is to explicitly list each class in a module and use `:autoattribute:`

The debugging test execution result is too long to display here. Please re-select your `runtime_info` lists to narrow down the scope of your analysis.



You need to trace the abnormal program behavior step by step to identify the root cause of the bug and locate the buggy method that contains the code to be fixed.
Now, please first analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior. 

Then, if you can already locate the buggy method and buggy code, reply with:
Buggy method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Otherwise, continue tracing by selecting the next method to observe. Reply with: 
Observed method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Note that {FILE_PATH} refers to the path relative to the repository. And if you want to observe a method inside a class, please specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME.

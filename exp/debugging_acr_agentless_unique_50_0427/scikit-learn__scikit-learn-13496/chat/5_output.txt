The issue arises because the `warm_start` parameter is not being exposed in the `IsolationForest` initialization process, so it cannot be set via `set_params`. The `IsolationForest` class inherits from `BaseBagging`, which supports `warm_start`. Therefore, the fix involves adding `warm_start` to the parameters accepted by the `IsolationForest.__init__` method.

From the currently observed code snippet of `IsolationForest.__init__`, it is clear that the `warm_start` parameter is missing in the parameter list passed to `super().__init__()`, which means it is currently not part of the `IsolationForest` class's initialization process.

With this understanding, the root cause of the issue lies in the parameters being passed during the initialization of the `IsolationForest` class.

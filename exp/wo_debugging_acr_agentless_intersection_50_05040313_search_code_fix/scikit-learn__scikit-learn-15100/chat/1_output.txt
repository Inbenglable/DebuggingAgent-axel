To address the issue with the `strip_accents_unicode` method in the `scikit-learn` project, I need to retrieve the source code of this method to understand its current implementation. This will help me in planning the exact modifications required to handle strings already in NFKD form.

Since no specific file path is provided for the `strip_accents_unicode` method, I will search for this method in the entire codebase to locate it and retrieve its source code.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("strip_accents_unicode")
```

To address the issue, I need to understand how the `units.quantity_input` decorator operates, especially focusing on how it handles the return value. This will help determine the right place to introduce the conditional check for a `None` return type. Thus, I need to find and examine the source code for the `quantity_input` decorator within the astropy project.

I'll start by searching for the `quantity_input` method in the codebase as I currently don't have a file path for it.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("quantity_input")
```

Based on the information provided in the debugging history, it seems that the root cause of the issue is the incorrect usage of the `captured_output` function in the `handle` method of the `reproduce.py` file, where it's being invoked with two arguments instead of one.

To resolve this issue, we need to correctly use the `captured_output` function to capture both `stdout` and `stderr`. The `captured_output` function from `django.test.utils.py` likely needs to be invoked separately for each stream.

Before generating the patch, I'll need to review the `handle` method from the `reproduce.py` file to ensure a proper fix. Additionally, verifying the definition of `captured_output` in `django.test.utils.py` may be useful, but it seems the debugging history has already provided sufficient information about its intended usage.

To proceed, I'll retrieve the source code for the `handle` method.

```python
search_method_in_file("reproduce.py", "handle")
```

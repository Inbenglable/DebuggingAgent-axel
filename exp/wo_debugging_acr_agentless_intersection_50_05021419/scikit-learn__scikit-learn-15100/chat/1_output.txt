To resolve the issue with `strip_accents_unicode`, I need to examine the source code for the `strip_accents_unicode` method in the scikit-learn codebase. Once I understand its current implementation, I can provide a patch that ensures it strips accents from strings even if they are already in NFKD form.

Since the file path of the method is not provided, I will use the search API to locate it in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("strip_accents_unicode")
```

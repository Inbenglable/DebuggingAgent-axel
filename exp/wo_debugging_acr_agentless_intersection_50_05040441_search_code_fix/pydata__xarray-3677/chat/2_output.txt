The issue occurs because the `Dataset.merge` method is designed to work with inputs that are either a `Dataset` or objects that can be cast to a `Dataset`. The error arises when a `DataArray` is passed into the method, as it tries to iterate over it as if it were a mapping, leading to an `AttributeError`.

Based on the retrieved `Dataset.merge` method code, it calls `dataset_merge_method`, which expects parameters that are compatible with the `merge` logic of datasets. To resolve this issue, we'll examine how the top-level `xr.merge` function handles a `Dataset` and `DataArray` and replicate any necessary conversion within the `Dataset.merge` method before calling `dataset_merge_method`.

We need to examine how `xr.merge` is implemented to see if it performs this conversion, so I will now search for the implementation of the `merge` function. 

```python
search_method_in_codebase("merge")
```

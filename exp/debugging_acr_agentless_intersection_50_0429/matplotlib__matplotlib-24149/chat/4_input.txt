[Bug]: ax.bar raises for all-nan data on matplotlib 3.6.1 
### Bug summary

`ax.bar` raises an exception in 3.6.1 when passed only nan data. This irrevocably breaks seaborn's histogram function (which draws and then removes a "phantom" bar to trip the color cycle).

### Code for reproduction

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
f, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.bar([np.nan], [np.nan])
```


### Actual outcome

```python-traceback

   1747                        "support generators as input")
   1748 else:
-> 1749     return next(val for val in obj if safe_isfinite(val))

StopIteration: 
```

### Expected outcome

On 3.6.0 this returns a `BarCollection` with one Rectangle, having `nan` for `x` and `height`.

### Additional information

I assume it's related to this bullet in the release notes:

- Fix barplot being empty when first element is NaN

But I don't know the context for it to investigate further (could these link to PRs?)

Further debugging:

```python
ax.bar([np.nan], [0])  # Raises
ax.bar([0], [np.nan])  # Works
```

So it's about the x position specifically.

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
Analyzing the traceback and the execution error, the issue arises when executing `ax.bar([np.nan], [np.nan])`, which calls `Axes.bar` in the `_axes.py` file. Within this method, it attempts to use `self._convert_dx(width, x0, x, self.convert_xunits)`. This line then invokes the `_convert_dx` method, which calls `cbook._safe_first_finite(x0)`. 

The `StopIteration` exception originates from the `_safe_first_finite` function in `matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py`, which is attempting to find the first finite value from an iterable that only contains `np.nan`.

The error suggests that there is no check or handling for iterables consisting solely of `np.nan` values, causing `next` to run into a `StopIteration` when it can't find a finite number.

To trace the function that's directly causing the observed abnormal behavior, we should take a look at the `_safe_first_finite` function, as it appears to be handling the input incorrectly in the context of this bug.

Observed method: `lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py:_safe_first_finite`
==================================================
The abnormal behavior is being triggered by the `_safe_first_finite` function in `lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py`. The function is designed to return the first finite value in the input iterable. However, if the iterable only contains non-finite values (like `np.nan`), it will raise a `StopIteration` exception when it tries to find a finite number but cannot. This is mentioned as a bug in the issue since `StopIteration` is not handled gracefully here. Instead of raising an unhandled exception, the function should likely return a sensible default value when no finite numbers are found, or handle the `StopIteration` exception appropriately.

Given this analysis, I can identify that the buggy method is:

Buggy method: `lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py:_safe_first_finite`

Your Output:
To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code for the `_safe_first_finite` method in the `cbook` module of Matplotlib to understand how it currently handles non-finite input values. This will allow me to generate the appropriate patch to fix the bug.

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

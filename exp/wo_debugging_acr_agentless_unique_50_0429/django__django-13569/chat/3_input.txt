<ISSUE>
order_by('?') unexpectedly breaking queryset aggregation
Description
	
Steps to reproduce:
class Thing(models.Model):
	pass
class Related(models.Model):
	models.ForeignKey(Thing)
With data
t = Thing.objects.create()
rs = [Related.objects.create(thing=t) for _ in range(2)]
The following query works as expected. The aggregation with Count produces a GROUP BY clause on related.id.
>>> Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('rc').values('id', 'rc')
<QuerySet [{'id': 1, 'rc': 2}]>
This also works as expected (at least to me). Although there is an aggregation, ordering by related means that the grouping will be broken down.
>>> Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('related').values('id', 'rc')
<QuerySet [{'id': 1, 'rc': 1}, {'id': 1, 'rc': 1}]>
But the following seems wrong to me.
>>> Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('?').values('id', 'rc')
<QuerySet [{'id': 1, 'rc': 1}, {'id': 1, 'rc': 1}]>
The random function call has nothing to do with the aggregation, and I see no reason it should break it. Dumping the query seems that indeed the random call breaks the group by call: (I simpilfied the table names a little)
>>> print(Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('?').values('id', 'rc').query)
SELECT "thing"."id", COUNT("related"."id") AS "rc" FROM "thing" LEFT OUTER JOIN "related" ON ("thing"."id" = "related"."thing_id") GROUP BY "thing"."id", RANDOM() ORDER BY RANDOM() ASC
I dug into the SQL compiler, and it seems to me the problem is inside django.db.models.sql.compiler.get_group_by, where the compiler combines all non-aggregate, non-ref order_by expressions into group_by. I patched it like this
for expr, (sql, params, is_ref) in order_by:
	if expr.contains_aggregate:
		continue
	if is_ref:
		continue
	expressions.extend([
		exp for exp in expr.get_source_expressions()
		if not isinstance(exp, Random)
	])
and things seem to work correctly. No failed tests against SQLite3 with default settings.

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue mentioned, we need to patch the `django.db.models.sql.compiler.get_group_by` method to change its handling of the random order expression when aggregations are involved.

I will first retrieve the source code of the `get_group_by` method from the relevant file to understand its implementation and where the patch needs to be applied.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("get_group_by")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("get_group_by")
RESULT:
#### django/db/models/sql/compiler.py:SQLCompiler.get_group_by
```python
    def get_group_by(self, select, order_by):
        """
        Return a list of 2-tuples of form (sql, params).

        The logic of what exactly the GROUP BY clause contains is hard
        to describe in other words than "if it passes the test suite,
        then it is correct".
        """
        # Some examples:
        #     SomeModel.objects.annotate(Count('somecol'))
        #     GROUP BY: all fields of the model
        #
        #    SomeModel.objects.values('name').annotate(Count('somecol'))
        #    GROUP BY: name
        #
        #    SomeModel.objects.annotate(Count('somecol')).values('name')

        # can't be ever restricted to a smaller set, but additional columns in
        # HAVING, ORDER BY, and SELECT clauses are added to it. Unfortunately
        # the end result is that it is impossible to force the query to have
        # a chosen GROUP BY clause - you can almost do this by using the form:

Your Output:
Ready generation: `True` 
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

**Patch Review:**

The patch addresses the `__getattr__` method inside `src/_pytest/capture.py`. It introduces a specific case for handling the `mode` attribute, removing the `'b'` to ensure that the mode is represented as text mode, consistent with the requirements specified in the issue.

**Analysis of Test Output:**

- **Original Output:** The test originally fails with a `ModuleNotFoundError` indicating that the `youtube_dl` module is not present in the environment. This error prevents the issue related to the `EncodedFile` class from being reached or observed during the test execution.
  
- **Patched Output:** After applying the patch, the test continues to fail with the same `ModuleNotFoundError`. This means the patch did not influence the test execution outcome because the environment issue persists.

**Conclusion:**

The test does not reach the code in `_pytest.capture.EncodedFile`, where the proposed patch takes effect, due to the missing `youtube_dl` module. Therefore, based on the information provided and without resolving the `ModuleNotFoundError`, it's not possible to determine if the issue related to `EncodedFile` is resolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

To fix the `Contains.as_set()` method, understanding how the `Contains` class operates in concert with Sympy's set representations is necessary. Additionally, I'll need to comprehend how the `as_set` method should ideally transform a `Contains` instance representing `x âˆˆ S` into a suitable set. Given the existing results, I need information on Sympy's set representations and operations. Thus, it makes sense to check related code and potentially similar methods or patterns elsewhere in the codebase. I'll look into the `as_set` related transformations.

Let's search all set transformations in the codebase to see if there's a related `as_set` implementation within Sympy that might provide insights or utility functions helpful for constructing the correct transformation logic.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("as_set")
```

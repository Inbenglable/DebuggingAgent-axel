To address the issue of incorrect parenthesizing in LaTeX printing of `Subs` expressions in Sympy, we can modify the `_print_Subs` method of the `LatexPrinter` class to ensure that parentheses are correctly added around the `expr` argument. Let's generate a patch for this correction.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/printing/latex.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        return r'\\left. %s \\right|_{\\substack{ %s }}' % (latex_expr,\n=======\n        return r'\\left. \\left( %s \\right) \\right|_{\\substack{ %s }}' % (latex_expr,\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch will ensure that the expression part of a `Subs` object is correctly parenthesized in the LaTeX output, as described in the issue details.

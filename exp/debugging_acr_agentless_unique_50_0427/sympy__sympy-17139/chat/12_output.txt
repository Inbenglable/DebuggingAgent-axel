To determine whether the issue is fixed, let's review the patch and analyze the test outputs.

### Review of the Patch:
The patch modifies the `_TR56` function to prevent direct comparison of complex numbers. Specifically, it checks if `rv.exp` is a number and whether it is complex. If both conditions are met, it returns `rv` without attempting further comparisons, which should safeguard against the invalid comparison and prevent the `TypeError`.

### Analysis of the Test Output:

#### Original Output:
The test output indicates that there was a `NameError` due to the undefined name 'I'. This suggests that the test code needs to import or define `I` from `sympy`, which is necessary to correctly execute the test.

#### Patched Output:
The patched output is the same as the original output. The test still fails with a `NameError` related to 'I', and subsequently raises an `AssertionError`, indicating that the core issue involving the complex comparison was not conclusively tested due to the initial `NameError`. Without resolving this initial error in the test setup, it isn't possible to accurately assess whether the patch resolved the original problem.

### Conclusion:
Due to the `NameError` in both the original and patched test outputs, the test could not be executed as intended, meaning we cannot verify if the original issue is fixed based on the provided test results. Therefore, the patch's efficacy in addressing the invalid comparison of a complex number is unchanged, as the test setup issue (with 'I' being undefined) must be addressed first.

Issue resolved: `False`

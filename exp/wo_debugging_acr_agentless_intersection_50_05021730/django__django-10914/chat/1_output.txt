To address the issue of setting the default `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION` to `0o644`, I need to identify where in the Django codebase the file upload permissions are set or used. This is likely managed within the storage or upload handling mechanism of Django. I need to search for relevant methods that deal with file upload permissions in Django's `FileSystemStorage` or similar classes, which are responsible for handling file permissions during the upload process.

I'll start by searching for methods related to file upload handling within Django, focusing on `FileSystemStorage`.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("FileSystemStorage")
search_method_in_codebase("get_available_name")
search_method_in_codebase("save")
```

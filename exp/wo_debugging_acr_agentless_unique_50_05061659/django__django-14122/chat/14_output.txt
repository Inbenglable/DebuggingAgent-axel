To resolve the issue with `Meta.ordering` fields being incorrectly included in the `GROUP BY` clause in Django's `SQLCompiler`, I'll make modifications to ensure that these fields are not affecting `GROUP BY` clauses.

Let's create a patch to address this:

```python
### django/db/models/sql/compiler.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        for expr, (sql, params, is_ref) in order_by:
            # Skip References to the select clause, as all expressions in the select clause are already part of the group by.
            if not is_ref:
                expressions.extend(expr.get_group_by_cols())
=======
        for expr, (sql, params, is_ref) in order_by:
            # Skip References to the select clause, as all expressions in the select clause are already part of the group by.
            if not is_ref:
                # Ensure Meta.ordering fields are not included if they exist in self._meta_ordering.
                if expr not in getattr(self, '_meta_ordering', []):
                    expressions.extend(expr.get_group_by_cols())
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This patch will skip adding `Meta.ordering` fields to the `GROUP BY` clause if such fields exist in `_meta_ordering`, which should be sufficient to handle this case.

Now, let's present this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/sql/compiler.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        for expr, (sql, params, is_ref) in order_by:\n            # Skip References to the select clause, as all expressions in the select clause are already part of the group by.\n            if not is_ref:\n                expressions.extend(expr.get_group_by_cols())\n=======\n        for expr, (sql, params, is_ref) in order_by:\n            # Skip References to the select clause, as all expressions in the select clause are already part of the group by.\n            if not is_ref:\n                # Ensure Meta.ordering fields are not included if they exist in self._meta_ordering.\n                if expr not in getattr(self, '_meta_ordering', []):\n                    expressions.extend(expr.get_group_by_cols())\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

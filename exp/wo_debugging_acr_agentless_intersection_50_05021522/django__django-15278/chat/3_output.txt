To resolve the issue with adding a nullable `OneToOneField` crashing on SQLite, we need to focus on the Django migration system's schema editor related specifically to SQLite. The relevant part of the migration system would handle the way fields are added to tables, particularly how unique constraints are managed. We need to understand the `create_model` function specifically for SQLite and related database schema editing functions.

Let's analyze each of the API's returned contents for relevancy:

- **tests/migrations/test_state.py:RelatedModelsTests.create_model**: This is related to testing migrations, probably not directly involved but might give context to how models are created in test environments.
  
- **tests/db_functions/datetime/test_extract_trunc.py:DateFunctionTests.create_model**: This function deals with testing datetime extraction and truncation, focusing on test data creation, irrelevant to our issue.

- **django/db/backends/base/schema.py:BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.create_model**: This is the base schema editor method, certainly relevant as it handles model creation across all database backends in Django.

- **django/contrib/gis/db/backends/oracle/schema.py:OracleGISSchemaEditor.create_model**: This pertains to Oracle's backend for GIS purposes, not needed as it is not relevant to SQLite.

- **django/contrib/gis/db/backends/spatialite/schema.py:SpatialiteSchemaEditor.create_model**: While Spatialite is a variant of SQLite for geospatial data, it is specific to GIS and not relevant for the general SQLite migration issue.

- **django/contrib/gis/db/backends/mysql/schema.py:MySQLGISSchemaEditor.create_model**: This is specific to MySQL, unrelated to our SQLite problem.

Based on this analysis, the relevant files and methods directly related to the Django migration process concerning SQLite are:

```
django/db/backends/base/schema.py:BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.create_model
```

This file contains the method that is most pertinent for analyzing and potentially modifying Djangoâ€™s schema operations for models, particularly to address the SQLite issue.

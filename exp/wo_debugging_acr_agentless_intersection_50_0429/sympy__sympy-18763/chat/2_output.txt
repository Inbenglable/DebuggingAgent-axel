To resolve the issue of incorrect parenthesizing of `Subs` in LaTeX output within the Sympy project, we need to modify the LaTeX representation function for the `Subs` class. We should focus on locating and potentially updating the method responsible for this functionality.

It's logical to assume there will be a method like `_latex` or related to printing within Sympy's printing module that specifically deals with `Subs` objects. Therefore, I need to locate and review this method to understand how to modify it for correct parenthesizing.

In the given directory structure, as `Subs` is defined in `sympy/core/function.py`, the relevant printing method might be located in Sympy's printing package, commonly found in files like `sympy/printing/latex.py`.

I'll now search for the related method to gather more information before proceeding with patch generation.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("Subs._latex")
search_method_in_codebase("latex")
```

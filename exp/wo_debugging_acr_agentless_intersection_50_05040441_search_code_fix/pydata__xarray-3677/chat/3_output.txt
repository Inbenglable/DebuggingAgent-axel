The issue arises because the `Dataset.merge` method does not account for `DataArray` inputs. The `xr.merge` function handles this by converting `DataArray` objects to `Dataset` objects using the `to_dataset` method before proceeding with the merge operation. To fix this, the `Dataset.merge` method should similarly handle `DataArray` inputs by converting them before calling the `dataset_merge_method`.

I have already reviewed the necessary code to understand how the `xr.merge` function deals with DataArray inputs.

Thus, I'm ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

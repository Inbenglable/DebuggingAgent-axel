To resolve the issue where the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass doesn't work for properties, I need to examine the implementation of the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass and understand how it currently handles docstrings for methods and functions. The problem arises because it uses `inspect.isfunction`, which doesn't account for properties. Therefore, investigating the logic within this metaclass is crucial.

I will search for the `InheritDocstrings` class in the codebase to identify how it functions and prepare for the modification needed to cover property docstrings as well.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("InheritDocstrings")
```

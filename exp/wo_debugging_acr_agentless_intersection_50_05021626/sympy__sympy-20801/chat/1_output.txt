To resolve the issue, I first need to examine the logic associated with ordering and equality operations in the `sympy` library, particularly how `S.false` interacts with numbers like `S(0.0)`. This likely involves understanding the comparison operations. Therefore, I need to search for relevant methods in the sympy codebase that handle equality checks or conversions for 0.0 with Boolean values.

Since `S.false` suggests a Sympy singleton related to `false`, the logic may be located in a specific class dedicated to these boolean constants and their interactions.

I'll start by searching for classes or methods related to the Sympy singleton or Boolean operations.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("S")
search_method_in_codebase("__eq__")
search_class_in_codebase("BooleanAtom")
```

Analyzing the current observed code from `trim_docstring` in `django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py` and the abnormal program behavior:

1. **Function Purpose:** The function `trim_docstring` aims to uniformly trim leading and trailing whitespace from docstrings.

2. **Key Operations:**
   - Lines are split into an array, `lines`.
   - The intended indentation is calculated using the minimum indentation of non-empty lines.
   - The first line and all subsequent lines are processed differently: the first line is stripped, whereas subsequent lines are trimmed based on the calculated indent.

3. **Observation on Line 37:** The problematic code occurs at line 37:
   ```python
   indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())
   ```
   Initially, all lines including the first are considered for indentation. This causes the error when the first line starts immediately rather than being indented.

4. **Suggested Solution from the Issue Description:** The suggestion to skip the first line looks valid as it avoids assigning an indentation level of zero that is causing the error.

5. **Runtime Error:** Not being able to import `simplify_exception` prevents the script from reaching and evaluating `trim_docstring`. While fixing imports is necessary for test execution, the focus on `trim_docstring` remains crucial as per the issue description.

Given the analysis, the `trim_docstring` method appears to have the code causing the abnormal behavior when rendering docstrings. Therefore:

Buggy method: `django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py:trim_docstring`

Based on the current observations, we're focusing on the `LogCaptureFixture.handler` method, which is responsible for returning the `LogCaptureHandler`. The method code suggests that it retrieves the handler from some internal store (`self._item._store[caplog_handler_key]`), which implies the handler setup is tied to `_item` and its store dictionary. However, this method itself only returns the handler; it doesn't directly deal with log levels.

Given this, the issue may reside in how the handler's log level is managed between tests, possibly involving the initialization or teardown procedures of the caplog fixture.

Since we've inspected the retrieval method and haven't located the code responsible for resetting the log level, we should trace deeper into the method that sets or resets log levels within the fixtures or handlers.

Observed scope: `src/_pytest/logging.py:340-360`

This range should provide insights into the setup and teardown mechanisms associated with the log levels.

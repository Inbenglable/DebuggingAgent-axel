To resolve the issue with the `URLValidator` tests failing, we need to identify where the `URLValidator` is implemented in the Django codebase. From the description, it seems the problem is related to handling forbidden characters (LF, CR, and tabs) in URLs.

I'll start by searching for the `URLValidator` class, as it seems to be the main subject of the problem.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("URLValidator")
```

To resolve the issue with the `KMeans` implementation related to the `n_jobs` parameter, I need to examine the code for the `KMeans` class implementation in scikit-learn, specifically the part of the code where the parallel computation is handled. This will allow me to determine if there is any part of the implementation that might cause differences in results depending on the number of jobs used. 

Therefore, I will retrieve the source code for the `KMeans` class to investigate this. I will also need to check the `fit` method specifically as it is likely where the parallelization logic is implemented.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("KMeans")
search_method_in_codebase("KMeans.fit")
```

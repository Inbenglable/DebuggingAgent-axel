To generate a patch for the issue, I need to inspect the `check_anchor` method that verifies the presence of an anchor in the HTML content of a response. I have retrieved the source code for the `check_anchor` method, and now I need to review the surrounding implementation to see how HTTP response errors are currently handled when checking anchors.

Since I have the relevant information from the code provided, I can proceed to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

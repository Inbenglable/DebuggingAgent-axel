To address the issue, I first need to review the implementation of the `fowlkes_mallows_score` function to understand where the overflow occurs and where to apply the proposed fix. Thus, I will retrieve the source code for the `fowlkes_mallows_score` function from the scikit-learn project.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("fowlkes_mallows_score")
```

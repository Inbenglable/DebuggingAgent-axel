Reviewing the provided information and the patch:

1. **Issue Description**: The original issue is about rendering a single-element tuple correctly. The specific problem is that `(1,)` is rendered as `(1)` without the trailing comma.

2. **Test Before Patch**: Originally, the test output was:
   - Input: `(1,)`
   - Output: `(1)`
   - Expected: `(1,)`
   - Matches expected?: `False`

   This confirms that the original implementation fails to produce the expected output for a single-element tuple by omitting the trailing comma.

3. **Patch Details**: The patch modifies the `visit_Tuple` method in `sphinx/pycode/ast.py`, specifically checking if the tuple has exactly one element and rendering it with a trailing comma:
   ```python
   if len(node.elts) == 1:
       return "(" + self.visit(node.elts[0]) + ",)"
   else:
       return "(" + ", ".join(self.visit(e) for e in node.elts) + ")"
   ```
   
   This correctly handles single-element tuples by appending the necessary comma.

4. **Test After Patch**: After applying the patch, the test output is:
   - Input: `(1,)`
   - Output: `(1,)`
   - Expected: `(1,)`
   - Matches expected?: `True`

   This indicates that the patched code renders the single-element tuple correctly, matching the expected output.

Based on this analysis:

- The patch correctly addresses the issue by modifying the rendering logic for single-element tuples.
- The test after the patch confirms that the output now matches the expected result.

Issue resolved: `True`

The patch aims to fix the issue by modifying the `_check_vocabulary` method to accommodate cases where a `vocabulary` is directly provided to the `CountVectorizer` instance. Initially, the method checks if `self.vocabulary` is `None` rather than checking the `vocabulary_` attribute before proceeding with further validation. It skips the `check_is_fitted` call if a vocabulary is explicitly provided.

However, after the patch is applied, the output reports an `AttributeError` stating that the `'CountVectorizer' object has no attribute 'vocabulary_'`. This indicates that the modified `_check_vocabulary` method attempts to access `self.vocabulary_`, which hasn't been initialized before checking its length or existence.

In contrast, the original output before the patch flagged a `NotFittedError` due to a missing vocabulary fitting process. The patched output now results in a different error (an `AttributeError`) rather than resolving the root problem described in the issue.

Therefore, the patch did not fix the initial `NotFittedError` problem and introduced a new error due to the unhandled `vocabulary_` attribute access.

Issue resolved: `False`

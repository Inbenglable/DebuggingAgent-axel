To determine whether the issue is fixed, we need to review the patch and analyze the test outputs.

### Patch Review
The patch modifies the `default_error_messages` in the `ModelChoiceField` class to include the `%(value)s` placeholder, which will allow the error message to display the invalid choice value when a `ValidationError` is raised. Additionally, it adjusts how the error messages are accessed in the `Field.validate` method to ensure the invalid choice value is correctly included in the error message formatting.

### Test Output Analysis

#### Original Output Before Patch:
The test fails due to a `ModuleNotFoundError` indicating that the module `reproducer` cannot be found. This suggests an issue with the setup of the test environment, not with the functionality of the `ModelChoiceField`.

#### Patched Output After Patch:
The patched output shows the same `ModuleNotFoundError`, meaning that the test did not run successfully due to the environment setup issue. The specific bug related to the `ModelChoiceField` error message format was not evaluated due to this failure.

### Conclusion
The outputs, both before and after the patch, indicate a test setup issue that prevents the test from running and assessing the actual functionality changes made by the patch. Since the test could not be executed, there's no evidence to confirm whether the patch resolves the issue with the `ModelChoiceField`.

Issue resolved: `False`

To resolve this issue, I need to understand the `_sparse_fit` method within the SVM implementation in scikit-learn. This will allow me to investigate how the division by zero occurs and to ensure it handles cases where the `support_vectors_` attribute is empty properly. I need to locate and retrieve the source code for this method.

I'll proceed by searching for the `_sparse_fit` method in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("_sparse_fit")
```

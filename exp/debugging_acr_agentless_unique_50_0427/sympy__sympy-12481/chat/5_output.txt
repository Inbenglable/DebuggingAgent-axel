To address the issue, we need to review the existing implementation of the `Permutation.__new__` method present in the `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` file. This will allow us to understand the current logic, particularly how cycles are being processed and how non-disjoint cycles are handled.

Let's retrieve the source code for the `Permutation.__new__` method to adjust the logic and resolve the issue.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py", "Permutation.__new__")
```

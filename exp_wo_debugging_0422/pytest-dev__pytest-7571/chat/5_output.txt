I'm ready to generate the patch since I have gathered enough information and source code from the API calls. The issue stems from the `caplog` fixture not restoring the expected log level after a test, which was supposed to be addressed by the `_finalize` method in the `LogCaptureFixture` class. It restores the log levels using the `_initial_logger_levels` dictionary saved during `set_level`.

To ensure that the `handler` level is also correctly restored, I'll extend the `_finalize` method to re-apply the original `handler` level saved during `set_level`. Here's the patch plan:

1. Alter the `_finalize` method to ensure the handler log level is restored, by storing its original level in `set_level`.
2. Verify that both logger and handler levels are correctly restored.

Ready generation: `True`

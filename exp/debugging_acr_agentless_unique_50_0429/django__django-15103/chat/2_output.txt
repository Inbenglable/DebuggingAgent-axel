Based on the current analysis and the trace information, the issue arises because the `json_script` template tag is not registered, leading to the `TemplateSyntaxError`. The error indicates that `'django.core.templatetags.json_script' is not a registered tag library`. This points to either the `json_script` tag being improperly registered or missing from where it should be defined. 

To resolve this, it is crucial to determine where the `json_script` should be defined and registered in the Django codebase. The `json_script` tag should be part of a registered template library, which seems to be missing.

The error occurs because the `find_library` method can't locate the `json_script` library in its registered template libraries, a sign that `json_script` is either not added correctly or not registered at all.

Therefore, the next step is to locate where the `json_script` should be implemented to verify if it is correctly defined and registered. Given that, we should start by investigating the typical Django folder that contains custom tags or template helpers, which are usually found in a `templatetags` package within a Django app.

To proceed accurately, I suggest you check the Django's `django/template/` directory or similar for any mention of a `json_script`, particularly looking at the registration functions or any `Library` object where template tags are declared.

Please investigate those locations or files where `json_script` might be registered or should be registered.

Observed scope: `django/template/defaulttags.py:930-1035`

This would encompass parts of the code responsible for loading template tags, which may help determine why `json_script` is missing.

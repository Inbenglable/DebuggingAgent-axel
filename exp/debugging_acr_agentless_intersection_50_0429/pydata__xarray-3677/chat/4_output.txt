To fix the issue with merging a `DataArray` into a `Dataset` using the `ds.merge()` method, I need to understand how a `DataArray` is typically handled during a merge operation and how it interacts with a `Dataset`. 

The current implementation of `dataset_merge_method` is designed to work with objects that support the `.items()` method, which is not the case for `DataArray`. To patch this, I'll likely need to introduce logic that converts or extracts the `DataArray`'s data into a compatible format.

Before proceeding with a patch, I need to inspect how the high-level `merge()` function works, as it handles the merge correctly. By examining that function, I can understand how `DataArray` objects should be processed.

Thus, I need to search for the implementation of the `merge()` function in the `xarray` codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("merge")
```

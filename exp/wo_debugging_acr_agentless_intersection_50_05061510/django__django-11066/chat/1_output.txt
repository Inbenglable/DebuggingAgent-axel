To resolve the issue mentioned, I first need to retrieve the source code of the `_rename` method within the `RenameContentType` class in the relevant file to understand how the `save` method is being used.

Given the file path provided in the issue description, I will search for the `_rename` method in the `django/contrib/contenttypes/management/__init__.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/contenttypes/management/__init__.py", "RenameContentType._rename")
```

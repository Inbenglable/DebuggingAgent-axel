Let's analyze the returned contents to determine their relevance to the issue:

1. **tests/gis_tests/test_measure.py:run**
   - This function is for running unit tests using `unittest.TextTestRunner`. It is not related to invoking a subprocess or handling PostgreSQL client connections. Therefore, it is not relevant to the issue.

2. **django/core/servers/basehttp.py:run**
   - This function is related to running a WSGI server. It deals with network settings and server configurations but doesn't involve invoking a subprocess or handling PostgreSQL database tasks. Hence, it is not relevant to the issue.

Both contents are not relevant to the issue at hand, as they do not involve subprocess invocation specific to the PostgreSQL client in the Django project. Therefore, none of the results from the API invocation are needed for resolving the issue. 

The selection is:

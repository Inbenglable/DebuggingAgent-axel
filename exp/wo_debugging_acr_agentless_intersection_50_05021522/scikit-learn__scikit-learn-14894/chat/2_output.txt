Based on the issue description, we are encountering a `ZeroDivisionError` in the `_sparse_fit` method of the SVM module when the `support_vectors_` attribute is empty. The relevant file path should be related to SVM, and more specifically the usage of `support_vectors_` in the context of fitting an SVM model with sparse data.

Let's review the API returned contents:

1. **sklearn/impute/_base.py:SimpleImputer._sparse_fit**  
This method deals with fitting a transformer on sparse data for imputation purposes. It is unrelated to SVM or `support_vectors_`.

2. **sklearn/svm/base.py:BaseLibSVM._sparse_fit**  
This method pertains to the sparse fit process within the SVM module and includes operations on `support_vectors_`. It matches the context of the issue described.

3. **sklearn/preprocessing/data.py:QuantileTransformer._sparse_fit**  
This method is about computing percentiles for sparse matrices in a quantile transformer. It does not relate to SVM or `support_vectors_`.

Therefore, the relevant content for resolving this issue is:

```
sklearn/svm/base.py:BaseLibSVM._sparse_fit
```

To address this bug, I need the current implementation of the `lock` and `unlock` methods in the `django/core/files/locks.py` file to modify them accordingly. Let's retrieve their source code before generating the patch.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/files/locks.py", "lock")
search_method_in_file("django/core/files/locks.py", "unlock")
```

To resolve the issue of the `QuerySet.only()` crashing after `select_related()` on proxy models in a Django project, we'll adjust the relevant code to correctly refer to the concrete model metadata. Hereâ€™s the patch using *SEARCH/REPLACE* format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/sql/query.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                opts = cur_model._meta\n=======\n                opts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch alters the metadata retrieval for proxy models, ensuring the query correctly references the concrete model's metadata, which is necessary for proper handling in the presence of proxy models.

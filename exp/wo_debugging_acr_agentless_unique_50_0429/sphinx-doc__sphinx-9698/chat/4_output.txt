To resolve the issue with the `py:method` directive with the `:property:` option in Sphinx, we need to focus on the content that is likely responsible for handling the signature of directives, particularly those related to Python. The relevant methods would be those dealing with `py:method` or any generic object handling, as these would potentially influence how properties are processed and integrated into index entries.

Letâ€™s analyze the API results:

1. **sphinx/domains/python.py:PyDecoratorMixin.handle_signature**: 
   - This is within the Python domain and involves handling signatures. The presence of this code indicates it may have relevance to directive handling related to Python, possibly influencing how a method is annotated, thus relevant.

2. **sphinx/domains/std.py:Cmdoption.handle_signature**: 
   - This is for standard domain options, rather specific to command options, thus irrelevant.

3. **sphinx/domains/javascript.py:JSObject.handle_signature**: 
   - This handles JavaScript object signatures and is irrelevant for Python directives.

4. **sphinx/domains/rst.py:ReSTRole.handle_signature**: 
   - This is related to ReStructuredText roles; thus, irrelevant for Python method directives.

5. **sphinx/domains/cpp.py:CPPObject.handle_signature**: 
   - This is related to C++ object signatures, irrelevant for Python.

6. **sphinx/domains/c.py:CObject.handle_signature**: 
   - Similar to the previous one, this is for C object handling; thus, irrelevant.

7. **sphinx/directives/__init__.py:ObjectDescription.handle_signature**: 
   - This seems to be a more generic or abstract method for handling object descriptions, it could be relevant since `py:method` may utilize a more general method for directive handling.

8. **doc/development/tutorials/examples/recipe.py:RecipeDirective.handle_signature**: 
   - Appears to be related to example tutorials and recipes, irrelevant for Python directive handling.

Based on this analysis, the relevant methods are:

```
sphinx/domains/python.py:PyDecoratorMixin.handle_signature
sphinx/directives/__init__.py:ObjectDescription.handle_signature
```

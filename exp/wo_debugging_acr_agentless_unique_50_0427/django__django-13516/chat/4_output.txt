To address the issue with `flush()` not working correctly during migration operations, itâ€™s essential to identify where the flushing of stdout or stderr is managed. The investigation should focus on the `BaseCommand` class methods, specifically those related to standard output management like `execute()` and `handle()` methods.

We need to examine these methods to understand how output flushing is handled during command execution. Given that the `BaseCommand` class has these methods, their behavior can be tailored to ensure proper flushing during migrations. Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code for these methods within the `BaseCommand` class to understand and potentially modify them to address the issue stated.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/management/base.py", "BaseCommand.execute")
search_method_in_file("django/core/management/base.py", "BaseCommand.handle")
```

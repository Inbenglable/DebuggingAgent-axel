Analyzing the current context:

### Code Analysis

From the `_split_gcd` code snippet, we have a series of utility functions managing numerator and denominator expansion and handling fractions. The focus is on the `split_surds` function.

```python
def split_surds(expr):
    split an expression with terms whose squares are rationals into a sum of terms whose surds squared have gcd equal to g and a sum of terms with surds squared prime with g
```

The `split_surds` function is expected to process expressions and segregate terms based on common divisors of their square terms. The code indicates its reliance on the output of `_split_gcd`, making its behavior dependent on the logic and handling within this method.

In `_split_gcd`, an empty list for `a` will cause an `IndexError` when accessed, specifically at `g = a[0]`, if no proper checks are put in place. Since it is called within `split_surds`, there might be scenarios where the conditions or data preparation before calling `_split_gcd` does not account for all instances, especially when there's no common divisor.

### Runtime Information
The traceback and `AssertionError` seem unrelated, focusing instead on an incorrect setup in `run_debugging_test.py`. Its presence helps emphasize that `_split_gcd` must be robust to handle these cases without assumptions.

Given these points, the issue could be within `split_surds`, specifically concerning the setup or calls to `_split_gcd`.

### Next Steps
While the bug might be within `split_surds`, further understanding requires precision on how it constructs or manipulates data before calling `_split_gcd` and under what circumstances empty data emerges.

Therefore, the next logical step is to observe the complete behavior within `split_surds`, especially scanning its interaction leading to `_split_gcd`.

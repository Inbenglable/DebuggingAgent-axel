I need to review the source code of the `LatexPrinter._print_Subs` method in the `sympy/printing/latex.py` file to make the necessary changes for the correct parenthesization. Therefore, I will retrieve that source code.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/latex.py", "LatexPrinter._print_Subs")
```

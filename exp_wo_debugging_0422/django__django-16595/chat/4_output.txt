I have gathered information on the `MigrationOptimizer` class, its `optimize` and `optimize_inner` methods, and the `AlterField.reduce` method. To address the issue where multiple `AlterField` operations are not being reduced, I need to adjust the `AlterField.reduce` method to handle cases where the operation is also an `AlterField`. Since I have the relevant details, I am ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

I'm ready to generate the patch for the issue. We have the necessary information from the `TestCaseFunction` class and the relevant methods, such as `runtest` and `addSkip`, which handle the `tearDown` logic with the `--pdb` flag. The `PdbInvoke` and `pytestPDB` classes control debugger interactions. I will proceed with the patch creation while ensuring that `tearDown` does not execute for skipped tests even when the `--pdb` flag is used.

Ready generation: `True`

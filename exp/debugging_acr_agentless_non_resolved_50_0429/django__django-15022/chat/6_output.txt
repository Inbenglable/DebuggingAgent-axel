Based on the provided information and traces, the error "Apps aren't loaded yet" occurs because Django's application registry isn't properly initialized before performing operations like migrations within the script. The critical insight here is that `django.setup()` needs to be explicitly called after configuring settings in standalone scripts to initialize the Django environment fully.

In our script, we are configuring Django settings manually without using the typical management command (`manage.py`) entry point, which automatically initializes the Django application environment. Hence, inserting `django.setup()` right after `settings.configure(...)` would likely resolve the issue by populating the application registry and setting up the necessary infrastructure for Django apps.

In conclusion, the following steps should resolve this particular issue:

1. After configuring Django settings but before performing any database operations (like running migrations), ensure that `django.setup()` is called.

The current observed method `django/apps/registry.py:Apps.get_app_configs` isn't itself the buggy location, but it illustrates where the failure is occurring due to a lack of initialization. The setup process in the script, which appears prior to command execution, must include `django.setup()`.

### Code to Insert:
```python
import django
...
settings.configure(
    # Configuration settings...
)
django.setup()  # Add this line to ensure Django Apps are initialized

# Rest of the script...
```

Given the error manifesting during initial setup rather than in a method logic bug, this resolution primarily involves correcting the script's setup sequence.

Consequently, there's no need to observe further downstream as the error is not within the inherent application logic of any method but in the initial setup configuration.

Buggy method: Addressed in the script setup by including `django.setup()` after `settings.configure()`.

The issue is that the code is supposed to create a bar plot with NaN values but results in a `StopIteration` exception. This occurs when `ax.bar([np.nan], [np.nan])` is executed.

The trace of the program shows that the exception is happening in the `_convert_dx` method of the `Axes` class, while attempting to handle the `width` parameter, specifically at the line where `x0 = cbook._safe_first_finite(x0)` is called. The error occurs because `_safe_first_finite` encounters an iterable that is fully composed of non-finite (NaN) values, and it doesn't handle the case gracefully, leading to the `StopIteration` exception.

Given the information and the traced path, the `_convert_dx` function in the `Axes` class is the focal point where a NaN input is not being handled correctly, causing this function to call `_safe_first_finite`, and thus triggering the error.

Therefore, the next step is to examine the `_safe_first_finite` method in `matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py`.

Observed method: `lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py:_safe_first_finite`

To address the issue of trailing newlines being allowed in usernames, I will update the regular expression used in the `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` classes within `django/contrib/auth/validators.py`. The change involves replacing the `$` with `\Z` to ensure that usernames ending with a newline are rejected. Here are the necessary patches:

```pythony
### django/contrib/auth/validators.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    regex = r'^[\w.@+-]+$'
=======
    regex = r'\A[\w.@+-]+\Z'
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Since both validators use the same regex string, the replacement applies to both `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` in the same file. Below is the JSON format for the edit:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/auth/validators.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    regex = r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'\n=======\n    regex = r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

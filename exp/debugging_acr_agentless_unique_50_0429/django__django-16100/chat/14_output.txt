The issue at hand is to ensure that the `changelist_view` in Django's admin is wrapped in a database transaction to maintain data consistency in case of errors during processing.

To resolve this issue, I'll need to locate the `changelist_view` method in the Django codebase, specifically within the admin's view handling code, and verify how to wrap its database operations in a transaction. Since specific file paths or class names were not provided in the issue, I'll need to search for the `changelist_view` method in the Django admin module.

Let's begin by retrieving the source code for the `changelist_view` method. 

```python
search_method_in_codebase("changelist_view")
```

Based on the API returned contents related to `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`, I'll analyze them to determine which ones are needed for resolving the issue:

1. **tests/test_utils/tests.py:1100-1106:**
   This content shows a test case that involves `default_storage.file_permissions_mode` and `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`. It directly tests the permissions mode setting. It is relevant to see how `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is being verified in tests.

2. **tests/staticfiles_tests/test_storage.py:529-535:**
   This content contains test settings for `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`, but focuses on static files storage and not directly on file uploads with `FileSystemStorage`. Likely not relevant for modifying `FileSystemStorage`.

3. **tests/file_storage/tests.py:892-898:**
   This content contains a test that verifies default file upload permissions when `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is `None`. It is relevant as it directly tests and observes default permissions for `FileSystemStorage`.

4. **django/core/files/storage.py:214-220:**
   This content shows the implementation of `file_permissions_mode` in the `FileSystemStorage` class. It accesses `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`, making it highly relevant for modifying the default value.

5. **django/conf/global_settings.py:304-310:**
   This content is the definition of `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` in Django's global settings. It's crucial as setting the default value here directly impacts the operation.

Based on the analysis, the following contents are needed for modifying the default `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` to resolve the issue:

```
tests/test_utils/tests.py:1100-1106
tests/file_storage/tests.py:892-898
django/core/files/storage.py:214-220
django/conf/global_settings.py:304-310
```

To resolve the issue, I need to understand how the `quantity_input` decorator works, especially how it handles return types and the `None` return type specifically. This involves looking into the implementation of the decorator function, likely in the `decorators.py` file or similar file within the `astropy` package. 

I will start by searching for the `quantity_input` function within the codebase to get its implementation details.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("quantity_input")
```

To address the issue of inconsistent results due to the `n_jobs` parameter, I need to inspect the `fit` method of the `KMeans` class, as this is where the parallel computation logic would be implemented. This should help in understanding how the computation is handled with different numbers of jobs.

I'll retrieve the source code for the `fit` method in `sklearn/cluster/k_means_.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/cluster/k_means_.py", "KMeans.fit")
```

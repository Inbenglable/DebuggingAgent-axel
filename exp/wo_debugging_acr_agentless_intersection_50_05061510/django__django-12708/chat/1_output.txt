To resolve this issue, I need to examine the implementation details of the `_delete_composed_index` method in the `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` file, as the error arises in that method.

I'll search for the `_delete_composed_index` method in the specified file to retrieve its source code and understand the logic implemented there.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "_delete_composed_index")
```

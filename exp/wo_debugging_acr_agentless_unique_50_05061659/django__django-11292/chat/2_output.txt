Based on the gathered information, the `BaseCommand` class is where command-line arguments are defined, and it includes a `stealth_options` attribute which lists options like `skip_checks` that aren't defined by the command parser. To add the `--skip-checks` option, modifications to the `create_parser` or `add_arguments` method might be needed to expose this option through the command-line parser. I need to check the `create_parser` and `run_from_argv` methods to understand how arguments are parsed and might be altered.

I will proceed to retrieve the sources for following methods:
- `BaseCommand.create_parser`
- `BaseCommand.run_from_argv`

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/management/base.py", "BaseCommand.create_parser")
search_method_in_file("django/core/management/base.py", "BaseCommand.run_from_argv")
```

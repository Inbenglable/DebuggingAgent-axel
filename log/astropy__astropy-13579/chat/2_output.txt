The debugging test was generated successfully and executed correctly. The output `(array(1.81818182e+11), array(12.))` matches the behavior described in the issue, indicating that the test is functioning as intended. The debugging test successfully isolates and reproduces the time and space complexity, as well as logical structures involved in the `world_to_pixel` function for `SlicedLowLevelWCS`.

The execution trace provides a usual insight into the internal workings of the function, confirming that the implementation reflects the world-to-pixel conversion while intersecting with slicers. No syntax or execution errors were encountered during the test.

Moving forward to Step 2, we will analyze the runtime information and work towards identifying the root cause of the problem before resolving it. We will track down the operation of the `world_to_pixel` for specific slice configurations to ensure correct calculation logic.

To address the issue, we need to make sure that the `file_permissions_mode` property in the `FileSystemStorage` class correctly defaults to `0o644` if not set explicitly. 

I need to retrieve the method responsible for saving files in the `FileSystemStorage` class, typically named `_save`, which might be where `file_permissions_mode` is applied. 

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/files/storage.py", "FileSystemStorage._save")
search_code_in_file("django/core/files/storage.py", "file_permissions_mode")
```

To fix the issue with `Contains.as_set()`, we need to create a set representation for `Contains` objects. To do this, we should examine how the `Contains` class is implemented. Once we understand the class structure and its properties, we can write a logical `as_set` method for it.

I will retrieve the `Contains` class from `sympy/sets/contains.py` to better understand how the `Contains` object is structured.

```python
search_class_in_file("sympy/sets/contains.py", "Contains")
```

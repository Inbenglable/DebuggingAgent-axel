To resolve the issue, I need more information about the `_UnparseVisitor` class, since the `unparse` function relies on it to render tuples. This class likely carries out the actual AST visiting and formatting logic, which would include handling of tuples. 

I will retrieve the source code for the `_UnparseVisitor` class in the `sphinx/pycode/ast.py` file.

```python
search_class_in_file("sphinx/pycode/ast.py", "_UnparseVisitor")
```

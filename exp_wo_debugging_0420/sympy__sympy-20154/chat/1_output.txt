To address the issue described, I need to retrieve the source code of the `partitions` method within the `sympy.utilities.iterables` module. This will enable me to understand exactly how the dictionaries are being reused and how to modify the method to copy the dictionaries before yielding them.

I will search for the `partitions` method in the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/utilities/iterables.py", "partitions")
```

To generate the patch for the identified issue, I need to retrieve the source code of the `get_object_members` method in the `ModuleDocumenter` class from the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file. This will allow me to understand its current implementation and modify it accordingly to respect an empty `__all__` attribute without including module members.

Therefore, I'll proceed with searching the method in the specified file:

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py", "ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members")
```

To generate a patch for the `symbols` function located in `sympy/core/symbol.py`, I will need to retrieve the source code of this method. This will help me understand how the method handles the extra parentheses scenario and the propagation of arguments across recursive calls. 

I will search for the `symbols` method in the specified file to retrieve its source code.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/core/symbol.py", "symbols")
```

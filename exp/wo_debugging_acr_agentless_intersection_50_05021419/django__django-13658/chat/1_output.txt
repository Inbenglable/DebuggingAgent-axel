To resolve this issue, I need to understand the current implementation of `ManagementUtility` and see how `CommandParser` is being instantiated. Since the description provides a snippet of the `__init__` method, I need to verify and possibly get the full source of `ManagementUtility` to make the changes.

Let's search for the `ManagementUtility` class in the codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ManagementUtility")
```

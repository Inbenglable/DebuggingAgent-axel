I need to retrieve the source code for the `fowlkes_mallows_score` function in the `scikit-learn` project to understand the implementation and make the necessary changes to address the issue described. The file path provided in the issue description is `sklearn/metrics/cluster/supervised.py`. Therefore, I will search for the method within this file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/metrics/cluster/supervised.py", "fowlkes_mallows_score")
```

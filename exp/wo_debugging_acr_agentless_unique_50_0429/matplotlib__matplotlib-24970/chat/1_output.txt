To address the deprecation warnings, it's important to examine the context of the lines in the `matplotlib/colors.py` file where the issue arises. Therefore, we need to retrieve the specific context or method enclosing these lines (line 730, 731, and 732) to understand the logic and how to apply the fix appropriately.

I'll first retrieve the method or surrounding code in the `matplotlib/colors.py` file involving these lines.

```python
search_code_in_file("lib/matplotlib/colors.py", "xa[xa > self.N - 1] = self._i_over")
```

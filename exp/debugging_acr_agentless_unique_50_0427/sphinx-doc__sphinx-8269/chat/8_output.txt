To determine whether the issue is resolved, we need to consider the following:

1. **Patch Context Analysis:**
   - The patch proposes modifying the `check_anchor` function in `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py` to evaluate HTTP status codes first. If an error status code is encountered (anything other than 200), it immediately returns `False`, ensuring that HTTP errors are reported correctly.

2. **Original Output vs. Patched Output:**
   - Both the original and patched outputs show a `FileNotFoundError`, indicating that the directory for `conf.py` does not exist. This error occurs during the test setup and is unrelated to the specific handling of HTTP errors in `linkcheck`.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The test is failing due to an irrelevant setup issue (directory not existing), not because of the core functionality of link-checking HTTP errors. Thus, we can't determine the effectiveness of the patch solely based on the output provided. The test setup issue must be addressed before effectively evaluating the patch.

Given this analysis, the issue isn't resolved because we cannot verify the patch functionality due to test setup errors.

Issue resolved: `False`

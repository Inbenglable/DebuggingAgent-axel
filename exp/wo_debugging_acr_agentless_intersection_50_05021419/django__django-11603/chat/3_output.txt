To modify the `Avg` and `Sum` classes to support the DISTINCT parameter, I need to verify how the DISTINCT feature is typically implemented in other aggregates such as Count. It might involve adding an `allow_distinct = True` property or similar syntax to the class definitions.

I'll search for the `Count` class to understand how DISTINCT is supported in it.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Count")
```

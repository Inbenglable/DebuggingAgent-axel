To resolve the issue with the LaTeX printing of the `Subs` class in the Sympy project, I need to identify the part of the codebase that handles the LaTeX representation of `Subs`. Given the search results, here is the analysis of the results:

1. **sympy/physics/secondquant.py:PermutationOperator._latex** - Not relevant. This is specific to `PermutationOperator` in the `physics/secondquant` module.

2. **sympy/physics/vector/vector.py:Vector._latex** - Not relevant. This `Vector._latex` is part of physics vector operations.

3. **sympy/physics/vector/dyadic.py:Dyadic._latex** - Not relevant. This is related to Dyadic operations under the vector module.

4. **sympy/physics/quantum/tensorproduct.py:TensorProduct._latex** - Not relevant. Handles LaTeX for TensorProduct in quantum physics.

5. **sympy/physics/quantum/state.py:StateBase._latex** - Not relevant. Deals with quantum state representations.

6. **sympy/physics/quantum/qexpr.py:QExpr._latex** - Not relevant. Concerns Quantum Expressions.

7. **sympy/physics/quantum/innerproduct.py:InnerProduct._latex** - Not relevant. Relates to quantum inner products.

8. **sympy/physics/quantum/cg.py:Wigner9j._latex** - Not relevant. Specific to `Wigner9j` symbols in quantum module.

9. **sympy/physics/quantum/anticommutator.py:AntiCommutator._latex** - Not relevant. Relates to anti-commutators in quantum physics.

10. **sympy/physics/quantum/gate.py:CNotGate._latex** - Not relevant. Part of quantum gate operations.

11. **sympy/physics/quantum/hilbert.py:TensorPowerHilbertSpace._latex** - Not relevant. Handles LaTeX for tensor power Hilbert spaces.

12. **sympy/physics/quantum/operator.py:OuterProduct._latex** - Not relevant. Concerns quantum outer products.

13. **sympy/physics/quantum/spin.py:WignerD._latex** - Not relevant. Specific to Wigner D functions.

14. **sympy/physics/quantum/commutator.py:Commutator._latex** - Not relevant. Relates to quantum commutators.

15. **sympy/physics/quantum/constants.py:HBar._latex** - Not relevant. Deals with constants like Planck's reduced constant.

16. **sympy/physics/units/quantities.py:Quantity._latex** - Not relevant. Handles latex for physical quantities.

17. **sympy/core/numbers.py:ImaginaryUnit._latex** - Not relevant. Represents imaginary unit in numbers.

18. **sympy/diffgeom/diffgeom.py:CovarDerivativeOp._latex** - Not relevant. Related to differential geometry operations.

19. **sympy/vector/scalar.py:BaseScalar._latex** - Not relevant. Concerns scalars in vector math.

20. **sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py:adjoint._latex** - Not relevant. Deals with the adjoint operation on complexes.

21. **sympy/printing/tableform.py:TableForm._latex** - Not relevant. Involves table representations.

22. **sympy/sets/setexpr.py:SetExpr._latex** - Not relevant. Set expression representations.

None of these results relate directly to the LaTeX printing of the `Subs` class. The correct location to make modifications would likely be within the Sympy printing system (`sympy/printing/latex.py`), specifically targeting functions such as `_print_Subs`, which wasn't retrieved in the results.

Considering the current results don't include the necessary function `_print_Subs`, I should attempt a more focused search to retrieve the part of `sympy/printing/latex.py` that directly deals with the `Subs` class for future steps.

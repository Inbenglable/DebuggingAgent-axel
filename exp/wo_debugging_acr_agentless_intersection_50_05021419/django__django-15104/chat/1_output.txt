To resolve the issue, I need to locate the method in the Django project where the error is occurring. Based on the traceback, the KeyError occurs in the `only_relation_agnostic_fields` method of the `MigrationAutodetector` class, located in the `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` file. I will search for this method to understand its current implementation so that I can apply the proposed fix.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/autodetector.py", "MigrationAutodetector.only_relation_agnostic_fields")
```

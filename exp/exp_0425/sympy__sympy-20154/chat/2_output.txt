I would need to retrieve the source code of the `partitions` method in the `sympy.utilities.iterables` module to analyze its implementation and make the necessary changes. I'll proceed to search for this method's code in the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/utilities/iterables.py", "partitions")
```

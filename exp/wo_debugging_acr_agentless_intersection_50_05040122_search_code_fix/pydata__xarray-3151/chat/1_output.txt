To address the issue where `xr.combine_by_coords` raises a `ValueError` for identical non-monotonic coordinates, I need to identify the piece of source code where the monotonicity check occurs in the `combine_by_coords` implementation.

Therefore, I will search for the method `combine_by_coords` in the xarray codebase to understand its current implementation.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("combine_by_coords")
```

The current observed code in the `Axes.hexbin` method shows that when the `C` parameter is specified, the `mincnt` condition applies as `len(acc) > mincnt`, where `acc` is the list of `C` values for each hexagon. This results in unexpected behavior when `mincnt` is set, because hexagons with exactly one `C` value don't satisfy the condition (since `len(acc)` would equal `mincnt` for these cases).

Given the behavior described in the issue, the potential fix involved changing the condition from `len(acc) > mincnt` to `len(acc) >= mincnt` to match the behavior when `C` is `None`.

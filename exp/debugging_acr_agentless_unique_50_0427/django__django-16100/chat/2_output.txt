The error log indicates an `ImproperlyConfigured` error due to accessing Django settings before they're properly configured. The issue arises when accessing the setting `INSTALLED_APPS`, which suggests that the Django settings have not been initialized with `os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'myproject.settings')` or some other method of configuring the settings.

This problem is occurring early in the script execution, likely because the settings are not set up before importing certain Django components that need them (like models or admin classes). Specifically, the imports begin to fail when attempting to import `User` from `django.contrib.auth.models`, as this action seems to rely on the settings being ready.

To further diagnose and confirm the issue, let's analyze whether the method involving the configuration check is somehow being prematurely triggered. We will trace the execution beginning at this crucial point to see any further details that indicate how the settings are being accessed or what imports occur beforehand.

Observed method: `django/conf/__init__.py:_setup`

You need to trace the abnormal program to resolve project issues and submit pull requests.
Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Add transaction handling to Changelist list_editable processing.
Description
	
It seems that changelist_view in Django admin is missing a transaction. Since the view may change data in database, it should be wrapped in a transaction to prevent unexpected states in case of errors.

</ISSUE>


Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:

This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
Analyzing the provided information, the main issue is an improper configuration of Django settings. The exception `django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured` indicates that Django settings are not set up correctly. Specifically, the error message "Requested setting INSTALLED_APPS, but settings are not configured" points out that the environment variable `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` has not been defined, or the settings have not been configured before accessing models, resulting in issues when importing Django modules.

The root cause lies in the setup of the Django environment in the test script. The setup is performed in the following lines of the script:

```python
# Set up Django environment
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'myproject.settings')  # Adjust the settings module according to your project
import django
django.setup()
```

The error indicates that either the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is not correctly set to the appropriate settings for the Django project or the settings module does not exist.

To trace further within the Django configuration, the method where the exception is thrown involves accessing apps that rely on the `INSTALLED_APPS` listâ€”this functionality is encapsulated within the Django app registry.

Observed method: `django/apps/registry.py:check_apps_ready`
==================================================
Analyzing the provided runtime information, the main issue arises from the improper configuration of Django settings before attempting to access models. The exception thrown is `django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured`, indicating that the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting is being accessed without the Django environment being properly set up.

The method `Apps.check_apps_ready()` checks if the Django apps have been imported, which requires the settings to be configured. The key line leading to the issue is:

- Line 137 in `django/apps/registry.py`: `settings.INSTALLED_APPS`

It attempts to access `INSTALLED_APPS`, causing an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception because the settings have not been set up yet. The root cause seems to be that the test script is not correctly setting up the Django environment before models are being accessed.

In the reproduced runtime information, the improper setup starts with the import statement:

```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
```

without prior setup of Django settings. Before proceeding with deeper analysis, the setup environment line in the test script should ensure it correctly configures Django settings before any imports that rely on these settings.

As of now, the scope contains both code logic and setup issues, so it's not fully conclusive to pinpoint the exact method causing the bug until the environment is correctly set up. 

To further trace the underlying code, I would need to inspect the initial setup and interaction with Django's configuration. Therefore, I will choose to observe the following scope within the test setup:

Observed scope: `django/conf/__init__.py:72-92`

This scope will provide insight into how settings are resolved internally, which is crucial for tracking down potential misconfigurations leading to the exception.
==================================================
The issue you're encountering is due to the Django settings not being properly configured before accessing the models. The trace clearly indicates that the error `django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured` is raised when attempting to access `settings.INSTALLED_APPS`. This occurs because the environment variable `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is not set or misconfigured.

To address the issue, it's crucial to ensure that the Django settings are properly set up before importing Django-specific parts like `models`. The observed traceback and analysis suggest that the setup environment line might be incorrectly placed or misconfigured.

### Current Observations:
1. The environment variable `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is not set, resulting in `settings_module` being `None`.
2. The error is triggered in `LazySettings.__getattr__` when it tries to access `INSTALLED_APPS` without proper settings.
3. The script attempts to import Django models before configuring the settings.

### Next Steps:
To properly diagnose and resolve the issue, we need to ascertain how and where the settings are being assessed and ensure configurations occur prior to any Django imports.

Observed method: `django/conf/__init__.py:Settings._setup`

This method is responsible for setting up the settings environment, making it crucial in diagnosing why and where the settings configuration is failing. Observing this should illuminate the correct setup process or point out any implicit missteps in the current configuration.
==================================================


Now you choose downstream method LazySettings._setup to further observe, tracing the abnormal program behavior.
This is the method code:
    63	    def _setup(self, name=None):
    64	        """
    65	        Load the settings module pointed to by the environment variable. This
    66	        is used the first time settings are needed, if the user hasn't
    67	        configured settings manually.
    68	        """
    69	        settings_module = os.environ.get(ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE)
    70	        if not settings_module:
    71	            desc = ("setting %s" % name) if name else "settings"
    72	            raise ImproperlyConfigured(
    73	                "Requested %s, but settings are not configured. "
    74	                "You must either define the environment variable %s "
    75	                "or call settings.configure() before accessing settings."
    76	                % (desc, ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE)
    77	            )
    78	
    79	        self._wrapped = Settings(settings_module)


This is the runtime information of LazySettings._setup:

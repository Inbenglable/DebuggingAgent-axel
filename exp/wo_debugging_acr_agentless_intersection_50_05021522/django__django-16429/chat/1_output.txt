Based on the issue description, the problem lies within the `timesince` method, specifically at the line where a pivot datetime is instantiated without considering the datetime object's tzinfo.

To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code for the `timesince` method to see its implementation and make necessary changes to handle timezone-aware datetime objects correctly.

I will use the API `search_method_in_file` to retrieve the `timesince` method in the specified file path.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/utils/timesince.py", "timesince")
```

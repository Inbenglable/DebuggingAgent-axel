Based on the current analysis, the issue seems to stem from the `doprint` method inside the `ReprPrinter` class, which calls `self._print(expr)`. The default behavior of `_print` does not handle `dict` and `set` objects following SymPy's internal representation for `srepr`. Consequently, these types are rendered using their standard Python representations. 

To resolve this, I need to observe the `_print` method implementation in `ReprPrinter` to ensure it appropriately handles `set` and `dict` objects by forwarding them to a suitable handler that returns a `FiniteSet` or `Dict` representation.

Observed scope: `sympy/printing/printer.py:251-251`

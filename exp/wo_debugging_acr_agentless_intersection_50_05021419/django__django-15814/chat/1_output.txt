From the issue description, it seems that the error occurs due to the usage of `QuerySet.only()` after `select_related()` on a proxy model. The suggestion in the issue points to the line in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` where changing `opts = cur_model._meta` to `opts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta` resolves the issue.

To create a patch, we should first examine the relevant section in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` around line 745 to understand the current implementation. Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code in that part of the file.

```python
search_code_in_file("django/db/models/sql/query.py", "opts = cur_model._meta")
```

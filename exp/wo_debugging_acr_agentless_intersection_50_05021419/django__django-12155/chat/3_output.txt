To resolve the issue in the `trim_docstring` function, I'll apply the suggested change, which involves skipping the first line when calculating indentation. This ensures that docstrings starting with content on the first line do not cause errors.

Here is the modification:

```pythony
### django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())
=======
    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change should resolve the issue by fixing the calculation of indentation in docstrings. Now I'll provide the edit result in JSON format.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())\n=======\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

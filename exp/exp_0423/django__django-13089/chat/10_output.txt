Based on the code retrieved for the `_cull` method in `django/core/cache/backends/db.py`, I have enough information to address the issue. The problem is related to how the `_cull` method attempts to access a result from `cursor.fetchone()` without checking if the result is `None`. A simple check needs to be implemented to ensure we don't attempt to subscript a `None` value.

Ready generation: `True`

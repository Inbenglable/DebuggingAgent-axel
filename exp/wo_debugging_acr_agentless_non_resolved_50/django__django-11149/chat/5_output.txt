The issue is that users with only view permission can edit inlines for ManyToManyFields that are auto-created intermediary models. The methods `has_change_permission`, `has_add_permission`, and `has_delete_permission` currently return `True` if the user has only view permission, due to their reliance on the `has_view_permission` method.

To generate a patch, we need to modify these permission methods to ensure that users with only view permission cannot edit. We need to incorporate additional checks in these methods to prevent modifications if the user does not have explicit change, add, or delete permissions.

I have retrieved the source code of the relevant methods in `InlineModelAdmin` class, and I am ready to generate a patch to address the issue.

Ready generation: `True`

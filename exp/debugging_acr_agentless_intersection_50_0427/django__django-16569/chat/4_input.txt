## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Formsets' add_fields() method fails in some circumstances if the argument index is None.
Description
	
Formsets' add_fields() method fails in some circumstances if the argument index is None.
When a FormSet has the attributes self.can_delete == True and self.can_delete_extra == False, calling the add_fields() method on that FormSet fails if the argument index is None. This occurs for example when calling FormSet.empty_form(). The result is that the method raises the exception TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'NoneType' and 'int'. 
Code example:
MyFormSet = forms.formset_factory(
	form=MyForm,
	can_delete=True,
	can_delete_extra=False,
)
my_formset = MyFormSet(
	initial=None,
)
print(my_formset.empty_form)
The reason this happens is that in in line 493 of [django.forms.formsets](â€‹https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/django/forms/formsets.py) index is compared to initial_form_count:
if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or index < initial_form_count):
Checking for index not None should fix the issue:
if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or (index is not None and index < initial_form_count)):
How to Reproduce
A self-contained example to reproduce this bug is as follows:
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os
import django
from django import forms
class MyForm(forms.Form):
	my_field = forms.CharField()
if __name__ == "__main__":
	settings_file = os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(__file__))[0]
	django.conf.settings.configure(
		DEBUG=True,
		MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES=[],
		ROOT_URLCONF=settings_file,
	)
	django.setup()
	MyFormSet = forms.formset_factory(
		form=MyForm,
		can_delete=True,
		can_delete_extra=False,
	)
	my_formset = MyFormSet(
		initial=None,
	)
	print(my_formset.empty_form)

</ISSUE>


A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
Based on the issue description and the provided test script, the error occurs when accessing `my_formset.empty_form`, resulting in a `TypeError` because the `index` being `None` is not handled correctly.

The issue is occurring in the `add_fields()` method when it tries to evaluate the condition:
```python
if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or index < initial_form_count):
```
Here, `index` can be `None`, which cannot be compared with an integer, leading to a `TypeError`.

The suggested fix is to modify this condition to:
```python
if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or (index is not None and index < initial_form_count)):
```

This improves the method's handling when `index` is `None`.

Given the description, this issue is occurring in the `django/forms/formsets.py` file, specifically in the `add_fields` method.

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:

Your Output:
To generate a patch for this issue, I need to examine the source code of the `add_fields` method in the `django/forms/formsets.py` file. I'll need to retrieve this method's source code to understand its context and ensure that the proposed fix is correctly applied.

Your Output:

==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

The given issue indicates that the `formats` argument is being ignored when writing tables to the HTML format using the `astropy.table` module. The reproducible test is set up to catch this problem by checking if the expected formatting is applied in the HTML output. However, the code correctly detects the error, proving the issue indeed resides in how `astropy` handles HTML table exports.

To properly debug this, we need to examine the astropy code responsible for handling the table write operations, especially focusing on the HTML export functionality. This involves understanding where the `formats` argument is supposed to be applied to the output. Given the description, the problem is likely to reside in the part of the code that manages writing tables using a specified format register.

Given this, let's start by examining the method responsible for handling the HTML format output within the `astropy.table` module.

Observed method: `astropy/io/ascii/html.py:_write_table`

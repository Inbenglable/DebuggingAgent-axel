The test indicates that there is an issue with creating a permutation with non-disjoint cycles using the `Permutation` class from the `sympy` library. Specifically, calling `Permutation([[0, 1], [0, 1]])` raises a `ValueError`. The traceback shows that the error is raised in the `__new__` method of the `Permutation` class while generating a permutation from the given cycles. The error is raised because the current implementation expects unique elements in the input cycles, but the input contains repeated elements as they are non-disjoint cycles.

The issue occurs in the following method where the error message is generated:
```plaintext
/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/sympy__sympy-12481/sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py:900
```

To get more insight, I need to observe how the `Permutation.__new__` method processes the input cycles and where it checks for duplicates.

Observed method: `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py:Permutation.__new__`

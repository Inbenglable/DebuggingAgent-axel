To address the issue with `srepr` not printing `dict` and `set` correctly, I first need to retrieve the source code of the `ReprPrinter` class because the `srepr` function uses this class to print expressions. This class likely contains the logic that controls how various data types are printed.

Therefore, I'll start by searching for the `ReprPrinter` class in the relevant file.

```python
search_class_in_file("sympy/printing/repr.py", "ReprPrinter")
```

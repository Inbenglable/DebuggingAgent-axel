The error observed in the test indicates that the `formats` argument is not being respected when writing an Astropy table to HTML format. Observing the method `UnifiedReadWriteMethod.__get__` at `astropy/io/registry/interface.py:146-147` does not provide direct insight into why the format is ignored. 

In order to identify the root cause of the issue, we need to trace the execution path further, focusing on the mechanisms used for writing tables, particularly the handling of formats for HTML output. The relevant parts of the code should involve the processing of formats within the I/O operations.

To proceed systematically, let's explore downstream methods involved in writing operations, particularly focusing on the HTML part. Thus, I will proceed to observe more deeply where formats are processed for exporting to HTML.

Observed scope: `astropy/io/ascii/html.py:0-100`

This hypothetical scope in a file `html.py` should encompass the relevant logic for writing tables in HTML format, assuming standard Astropy file structuring. We are particularly interested in understanding how the format argument is processed or overlooked during HTML generation. This scope is selected to refine our search around the components directly responsible for HTML output in the `astropy.io.ascii` module.

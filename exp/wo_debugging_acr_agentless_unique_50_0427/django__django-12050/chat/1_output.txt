To address the issue mentioned, I need to inspect the source code for the `resolve_lookup_value` method. This will help me understand where the coercion from list to tuple occurs so that I can make the necessary adjustments. Since the method name and its specific location in the codebase are not provided, I will utilize the `search_method_in_codebase` API to locate it.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("resolve_lookup_value")
```

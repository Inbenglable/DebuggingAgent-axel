The test output before and after applying the patch indicates an `ImportError` related to importing `simplify_exception` from `django.contrib.admindocs.views`, which prevents the test from executing correctly. This error is unrelated to the specific issue described in the bug report, which pertains to indentation logic in the `trim_docstring` function.

Analyzing the patch:

### Patch Review
The proposed patch alters the `indent` calculation in the `trim_docstring` function, as follows:
- **Original Code**: 
  ```python
  indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())
  ```
- **Patched Code**:
  ```python
  indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())
  ```

This modification aims to skip the first line when calculating the indentation, which matches the solution proposed in the issue description. The problem was indeed the inclusion of the first line in these calculations, which could lead to incorrect indentation detection when the first line is not empty.

### Test Execution
Due to the `ImportError`, the test does not execute past the import statement, preventing verification of whether the patch resolves the original docstring issue. This error must be addressed before valid test execution can occur.

### Conclusion
While the logic in the patch directly addresses the issue described, the test output before and after applying the patch remains the same due to an unrelated error (`ImportError`). Without resolving this import issue and running the test successfully, we cannot conclusively verify whether the patch fixes the original issue about the indentation.

Issue resolved: `False`

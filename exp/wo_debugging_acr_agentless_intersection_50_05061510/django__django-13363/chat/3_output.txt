To address the issue comprehensively, I need to inspect the implementation details of the `get_current_timezone_name()` method and understand the `TimeZone` mixin used in `TruncBase`. I will first retrieve these relevant code segments to better understand how the timezone information is being handled and why the `tzinfo` parameter is not being utilized. 

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "get_current_timezone_name")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TimeZone")
```

To address the issue where an empty `__all__` attribute is ignored, we will ensure that the `filter_members` method in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` considers `__all__` when filtering members, even if it is empty. Specifically, if `__all__` is defined and empty, no members should be included. Here's the patch in *SEARCH/REPLACE* format:

```pythony
### sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
elif want_all and special_member_re.match(membername):
=======
elif self.options.members is not ALL and namespace == '' and not self.options.members:
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Here's the JSON format for the patch:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nelif want_all and special_member_re.match(membername):\n=======\nelif self.options.members is not ALL and namespace == '' and not self.options.members:\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

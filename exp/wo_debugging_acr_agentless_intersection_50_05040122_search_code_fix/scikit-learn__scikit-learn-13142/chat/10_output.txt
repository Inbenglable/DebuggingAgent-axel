The patch conveys an intention to synchronize the parameters used in the `fit_predict` method with the `predict` method specifically when `n_init > 1`. The change involves setting `best_params` to the instance before returning labels determined by `log_resp.argmax(axis=1)`. 

However, despite the patch, the behavior before and after applying it remains the same. Below is the analysis:

### Test Output Comparison:
- **Original Output:**
  - `no n_init`: `Arrays equal: True`
  - `n_init=5`: `Arrays equal: False`
    
- **Patched Output:**
  - `no n_init`: `Arrays equal: True`
  - `n_init=5`: `Arrays equal: False`

### Analysis:
The inconsistency (`Arrays equal: False`) persists when `n_init=5`. This indicates that the attempted solution to enforce parameter consistency hasn't achieved the intended effect of aligning the behavior of `fit_predict` with that of `predict`.

### Conclusion:
The issue with the disagreement between `fit_predict` and `predict` when `n_init > 1` is still present. Therefore, the bug is not resolved by the patch.

Issue resolved: `False`

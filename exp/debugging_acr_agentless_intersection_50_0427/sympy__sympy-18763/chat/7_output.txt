To resolve the issue with incorrect parenthesizing in the `LatexPrinter._print_Subs` method, we need to ensure that the expression inside `Subs` is always surrounded by parentheses in the LaTeX output. This can be achieved by using the `parenthesize` method with appropriate precedence.

Here's the patch to add parentheses to the expression inside `Subs`:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/printing/latex.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        latex_expr = self._print(expr)\n=======\n        latex_expr = self.parenthesize(expr, PRECEDENCE['Atom'], strict=True)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This modification ensures that the expression `-x + y` within `Subs` is enclosed in parentheses when printed in LaTeX, leading to the correct output: `'3 \\left. \\left(- x + y\\right) \\right|_{\\substack{ x=1 }}'`.

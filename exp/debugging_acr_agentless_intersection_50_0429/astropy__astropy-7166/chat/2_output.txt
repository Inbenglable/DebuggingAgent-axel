The issue occurs because the current implementation of the `InheritDocstrings.__init__` method checks whether each class attribute is a function using `inspect.isfunction(val)`. This check doesn't include properties, as properties are not functions. Consequently, the logic for inheriting docstrings doesn't apply to properties, leading to the "Property docstring not inherited" error.

Therefore, to address the problem, we need to modify the existing logic so it also considers properties when applying docstring inheritance. The likely change would involve updating the part of the method where the inspection occurs, so both functions and properties are included.

Given the analysis, the buggy behavior seems apparent within the loop iterating over `dct.items()` and using `inspect.isfunction(val)`:

### Buggy Method
`astropy/utils/misc.py:InheritDocstrings.__init__`

With our analysis, I suggest enhancing the check to also account for properties. This can be done by checking if the attribute is a property and if its `__doc__` is `None`, alongside the current logic in the condition. Applying these changes will resolve the inheritance of property docstrings.

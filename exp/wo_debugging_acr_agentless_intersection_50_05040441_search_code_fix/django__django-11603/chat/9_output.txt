To determine if the issue is fixed, let's analyze the patch and the output before and after applying the patch.

### Patch Analysis
The patch adds an `allow_distinct` attribute to the `Avg` and `Sum` aggregate classes in Django:

```python
### django/db/models/aggregates.py
class Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):
    allow_distinct = True

class Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):
    allow_distinct = True
```

This modification is intended to enable DISTINCT support for Avg and Sum aggregates in Django, making them behave similarly to the Count aggregate.

### Test Output Analysis

#### Original Output
The original output shows a `django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet.` error. This indicates a problem with how Django's application registry is configured in the test script.

#### Patched Output
After applying the patch, the test gives the same error: `django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet.` This suggests that the test wasn't able to run successfully due to the application registry not being ready, leaving the issue untested. Without running the actual test logic, we can't confirm if the patch resolves the issue.

### Conclusion
Both before and after patching, the test fails to run due to application registry issues. Consequently, the test doesn't verify whether the application's functionality concerning `DISTINCT` support for `Avg` and `Sum` has been addressed.

For accurate results, the test setup needs adjustments (e.g., using `django.setup()` after configuring settings and ensuring models are part of an installed app) to resolve the application registry error. Only after fixing the test environment setup can the patch efficacy be evaluated properly.

Issue resolved: `False`

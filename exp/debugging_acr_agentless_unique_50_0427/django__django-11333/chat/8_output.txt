To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code of the `get_resolver` method in `django/urls/resolvers.py`. This method is central to the discussed problem, as indicated by the debugging history and the observed failure conditions. I will analyze the code further to refine the logic for handling `settings.ROOT_URLCONF`.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/urls/resolvers.py", "get_resolver")
```

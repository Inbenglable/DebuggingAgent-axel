The methodology of debugging involves tracing through the code pathways. Since an issue in the SymPy library's `srepr` function is causing improper representation of sets and dictionaries, let's focus on how `srepr` applies `ReprPrinter.doprint`. 

The `Exception` message implies there might be a misunderstanding between the naming or the availability of the method in the codebase. Let's instead examine how `ReprPrinter` handles expressions and investigate how it processes different types such as sets and dictionaries.

Therefore, we need to explore the approach taken by `ReprPrinter` to produce string representations. Given the naming conventions commonly used, one plausible method to inspect might be the one determining representation for sets and dictionaries.

Observed method: `sympy/printing/repr.py:ReprPrinter._print_FiniteSet`

To address the issue of incorrect computation of separability for nested CompoundModels in the Astropy library, the solution involves modifying the `_separable` function so it correctly handles cases when combining models with the `&` operator. Here's the patch proposal to fix the identified bug:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### astropy/modeling/separable.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        return _operators[transform.op](sepleft, sepright)\n=======\n        if transform.op == '&':\n            return np.block([ [sepleft, np.zeros_like(sepright)], [np.zeros_like(sepleft), sepright] ])\n        else:\n            return _operators[transform.op](sepleft, sepright)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Change in `_separable` function**: 
  - By modifying the handling of the `&` operator, we should concatenate the matrices for left and right submodels in a block diagonal fashion using `np.block`. This ensures that the separability matrices reflect the independent nature of nested compound models correctly, preserving independence when inputs are combined with `&`. 

This change will maintain correct separability behavior when models are combined with other operations and keep the intended separability for complex, nested combinations too.

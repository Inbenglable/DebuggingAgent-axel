In order to resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code of the `Point.__add__` method that was identified as problematic. This will help me understand how the method deals with operand types, particularly the `Mul` object resulting from reverse multiplication.

Therefore, I will search for the `Point.__add__` method in the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/geometry/point.py", "Point.__add__")
```

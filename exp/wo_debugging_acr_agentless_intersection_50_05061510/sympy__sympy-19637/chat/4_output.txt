To review the patch and determine if the issue is fixed, let's assess the changes and their impact on the test output:

### Analysis of the Patch:
1. **Issue Description**:
   - The bug is caused by referencing the `kern` variable before it is assigned a value within the `kernS` function.
   
2. **Patch Application**:
   - The patch initializes `kern` with the value `'_'` at the beginning, making it accessible within all branches of the function.

3. **Patch Impact**:
   - By initializing `kern` early, the patch should prevent the `UnboundLocalError` from occurring. 

### Test Output Analysis:
- **Original Output**:
  - Before the patch, the test output includes an `UnboundLocalError: local variable 'kern' referenced before assignment`.

- **Patched Output**:
  - After applying the patch, the test output is empty, which indicates that the `UnboundLocalError` did not occur. This implies that there were no exceptions raised, suggesting that the function executed without errors.

### Conclusion:
Given that the `UnboundLocalError` is no longer present after applying the patch and the test runs without errors, it is reasonable to conclude that the patch has resolved the issue. The initialization of `kern` prevents the error from occurring.

**Issue resolved**: `True`

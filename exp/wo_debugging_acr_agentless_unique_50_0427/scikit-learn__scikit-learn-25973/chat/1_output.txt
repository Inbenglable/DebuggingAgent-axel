To address the issue, I need to understand how the `cv` parameter is handled in the `SequentialFeatureSelector` class. Specifically, I want to retrieve the source code related to the `fit` method in the `SequentialFeatureSelector` class because the error occurs during the fit process. Knowing the file path would be helpful, but since it's not provided, I will search for the class and method name in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("SequentialFeatureSelector.fit")
search_class_in_codebase("SequentialFeatureSelector")
```

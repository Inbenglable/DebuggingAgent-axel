You are a debugging agent tasked with precisely using tools to resolve issues and submit pull requests.

**Current Task:**  
Resolve the following issue in the django project:

Add DISTINCT support for Avg and Sum aggregates.
Description
	
As an extension of #28658, aggregates should be supported for other general aggregates such as Avg and Sum. Before 2.2, these aggregations just ignored the parameter, but now throw an exception.
This change would just involve setting these classes as allowing DISTINCT, and could also be applied to Min and Max (although pointless).


Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:

from django.db.models import Avg, Sum

# Try to create an Avg aggregate with distinct=True
try:
    avg = Avg('field', distinct=True)
except TypeError as e:
    print("Avg with distinct error:", e)

# Try to create a Sum aggregate with distinct=True
try:
    sum = Sum('field', distinct=True)
except TypeError as e:
    print("Sum with distinct error:", e)

**Test Execution Results:**

Avg with distinct error: Avg does not allow distinct.
Sum with distinct error: Sum does not allow distinct.


Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

1. Create a minimal debugging test based on the reproduce test.
2. Debug by reviewing the relevant source code and monitoring runtime information.
3. Once you have identified the root cause, modify the code with minimal changes.
4. Rerun the reproduction script to confirm that the issue is fixed.

Focus on Step 1: generate a debugging test. At the end of your analysis, provide the specific code in the following **JSON format**.
Note: You should clearly specify the tests you are debugging as much as possible. Minimizing the amount of code will better assist you in analyzing runtime information later.

"debugging_test" : "import ... # Your debugging test code here"
}

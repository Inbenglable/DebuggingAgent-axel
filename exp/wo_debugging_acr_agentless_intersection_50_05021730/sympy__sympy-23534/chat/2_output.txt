The source code for the `symbols` function from the `sympy/core/symbol.py` file has been provided. This code is where the issue arises, related to handling an extra layer of parentheses affecting the creation of `Function` objects instead of `Symbol` objects.

The `symbols` function is designed to transform strings into instances of the `Symbol` class and can also create objects like `Function` when specified via the `cls` keyword argument. The issue lies in how nested tuples are handled when parentheses are used in the input `names`.

I have the necessary information from the provided implementation to generate a patch. 

Ready generation: `True`

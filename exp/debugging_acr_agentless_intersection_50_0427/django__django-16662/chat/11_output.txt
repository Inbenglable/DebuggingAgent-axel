Here is the patch to adjust the import ordering logic in the `MigrationWriter.as_string` method to ensure all `import` statements precede `from ... import ...` statements within the migration files.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/migrations/writer.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        sorted_imports = sorted(imports, key=lambda i: i.split()[1])\n=======\n        sorted_imports = sorted(imports, key=lambda i: (i.split()[0] != 'import', i.split()[1]))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch modifies the sorting logic to prioritize `import` statements before `from ... import ...` statements while keeping alphabetical order within these groups, aligning with the Django coding style and isort defaults.

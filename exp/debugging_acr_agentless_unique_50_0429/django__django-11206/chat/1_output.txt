The issue arises because the `nformat` method in `django.utils.numberformat` is attempting to access the Django settings before they have been configured. This is apparent from the `ImproperlyConfigured` exception that suggests settings are not configured and highlights the line where the settings are accessed.

The stack trace shows that this issue occurs in the `format` method of the `django.utils.numberformat` module:

```
use_grouping = (use_l10n or (use_l10n is None and settings.USE_L10N)) and settings.USE_THOUSAND_SEPARATOR
```

The code attempts to use `settings.USE_L10N` and `settings.USE_THOUSAND_SEPARATOR`, and since settings are not yet configured, it results in an error.

To proceed, I will analyze the `format` method in more detail to assess its logic and determine what changes need to be made to handle very small decimals correctly without relying on unconfigured settings.

Observed method: `django/utils/numberformat.py:format`

The issue at hand is adding DISTINCT support to the Avg, Sum, Min, and Max aggregate functions in Django. The patch modifies the `django/db/models/aggregates.py` file to allow these classes to support the DISTINCT option.

However, based on the provided test outputs, the problem with the `AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet.` error still persists both before and after the patch, indicating a misconfiguration or issue within the test setup, unrelated to the changes meant to address the DISTINCT support.

This error suggests that the necessary Django app configuration isn't correctly set up or that the database models aren't appropriately initialized before the tests are executed. The patch's focus on aggregate support does not address this issue.

Given this misalignment between the objectives of the patch and the remaining error message, the issue concerning errors raised due to the missing DISTINCT support is indeterminable from the output. 

Thus, based on the evidence solely presented:
Issue resolved: `False`

To resolve the issue of allowing specific private members to be documented using the `:private-members:` option in autodoc, I need to identify where this behavior is defined and modified in the Sphinx codebase. Typically, this would involve modifications in the autodoc module where member filtering occurs. I will start by searching for the existing functionality related to private members in autodoc to understand how they are currently handled.

I will proceed with searching the codebase, focusing on autodoc's implementation that deals with member filtering.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("filter_members")
search_method_in_codebase("get_private_members")
search_code_in_codebase(":private-members:")
```

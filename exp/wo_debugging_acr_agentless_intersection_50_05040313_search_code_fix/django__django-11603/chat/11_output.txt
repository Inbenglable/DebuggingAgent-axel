To resolve the issue of adding DISTINCT support for Avg and Sum aggregates in Django, we need to modify the `Avg`, `Sum`, `Min`, and `Max` classes to allow DISTINCT operations by overriding the `allow_distinct` attribute from their superclass `Aggregate`.

Here are the patches needed to achieve this:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):\n=======\nclass Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):\n=======\nclass Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Min(Aggregate):\n=======\nclass Min(Aggregate):\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### django/db/models/aggregates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nclass Max(Aggregate):\n=======\nclass Max(Aggregate):\n    allow_distinct = True\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This modification will allow DISTINCT operations in Avg and Sum aggregations by altering the `allow_distinct` attribute in their respective class declarations, in line with the existing setup in the `Aggregate` superclass.

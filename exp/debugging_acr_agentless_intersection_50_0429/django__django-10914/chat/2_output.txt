The current issue relates to the inconsistent file permissions set for uploaded files when using different storage backends. The function `FileSystemStorage.save` calls the private method `_save`, which is responsible for handling the actual storage of files. The observed behavior indicates that the permissions for files saved using a `TemporaryUploadedFile` end up as `0o600`, likely due to the `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` method setting restrictive permissions.

The `FileSystemStorage.save` method has been traced, and the trace indicates it calls `_save`. The inconsistency in file permissions is likely being handled in or after this downstream call, as the discrepancy in expected permissions is not resolved by the end of the `save` method. The `_save` method is where the file is actually saved, so it is a good candidate for further inspection to resolve this issue.

To pinpoint the exact problem, let's examine the `_save` method next.

Observed scope: `django/core/files/storage.py:53-<end_of__save_method>` (assumption: you will need to find where `_save` is defined, this line number is assumed following `save` method)

To resolve the issue, we need to consider where the `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is currently defined or utilized in Django's codebase. This involves locating the relevant places within Django's codebase where files are stored or uploaded via `FileSystemStorage`, particularly focusing on how permissions are managed. We should look for relevant classes or functions related to file uploading and storage.

Let's start by searching for occurrences related to `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`, `FileSystemStorage`, and `upload handlers` involving temporary files.

```python
search_code_in_codebase("FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS")
search_class_in_codebase("FileSystemStorage")
search_code_in_codebase("NamedTemporaryFile")
```

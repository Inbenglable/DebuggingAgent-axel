To address the issue of attempting to compare complex numbers in the `_TR56` method, we'll adjust the code to handle complex exponents more appropriately. Instead of directly comparing the exponent, we'll check if it is a number and whether it is complex.

Let's create the necessary patch in "SEARCH/REPLACE" format to fix this problem:

```pythony
### sympy/simplify/fu.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if (rv.exp < 0) == True:
=======
        if rv.exp.is_number and rv.exp.is_real and (rv.exp < 0):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that before making any numerical comparison, we check if the exponent is real. This should prevent the `TypeError` caused by invalid comparisons of complex numbers. Next, let's provide the JSON format for this edit:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/simplify/fu.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if (rv.exp < 0) == True:\n=======\n        if rv.exp.is_number and rv.exp.is_real and (rv.exp < 0):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

To accurately address the issue, I need to retrieve the full source code of the `_sparse_fit` method in the `BaseLibSVM` class from the `sklearn/svm/base.py` file. This is essential to ensure that the patch is applied correctly within the method's context.

I'll proceed to retrieve the complete source code for the `_sparse_fit` method.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/svm/base.py", "BaseLibSVM._sparse_fit")
```

To resolve the issue related to the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass and its interaction with properties, I need to locate the source code of the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass within the Astropy project. This will enable me to understand its current implementation and identify where changes need to be made to handle properties correctly. Therefore, I will search for the `InheritDocstrings` class in the codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("InheritDocstrings")
```

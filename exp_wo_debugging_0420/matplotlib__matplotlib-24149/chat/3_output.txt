To address the issue, we need to examine the usage of `cbook._safe_first_finite` in the `bar` method and how NaN values are handled. After reviewing the current information, it seems we need to inspect the `_safe_first_finite` function to understand why it fails with all-NaN datasets.

Let's locate the source code for the `_safe_first_finite` function in the `cbook` module to further diagnose the problem.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("_safe_first_finite")
```

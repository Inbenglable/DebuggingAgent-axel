To further investigate the inconsistency issue related to `n_jobs` in the `KMeans` class, I need to examine the `k_means` function being called in the `fit` method. This function likely contains the logic for performing the clustering with possibly parallel computations. 

I'll search for the `k_means` function in the codebase to understand the implementation details and identify any potential causes for discrepancy in results with different values of `n_jobs`.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("k_means")
```

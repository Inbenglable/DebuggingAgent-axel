To fix the issue with `strip_accents_unicode` in `scikit-learn`, we need to modify the function so that it strips accents from strings even if they are already in NFKD form. The current approach checks if the normalized string is the same as the input and returns it unchanged if so. Instead, the method should go through the normalized string and filter out any combining characters.

Here's the patch for the `strip_accents_unicode` function:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    if normalized == s:\n        return s\n    else:\n=======\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

In this patch:
- Removed the conditional check that returns `s` unchanged if it's already in normalized form, ensuring that all combining characters are removed.

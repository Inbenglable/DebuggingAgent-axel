I need to further investigate how DurationField expressions are handled within SQLite and MySQL databases. I will explore the operations managed in the respective classes for these databases. This could provide additional insights into the patch requirements.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py", "SQLiteDatabaseOperations")
search_class_in_file("django/db/backends/mysql/base.py", "MySQLDatabaseOperations")
```

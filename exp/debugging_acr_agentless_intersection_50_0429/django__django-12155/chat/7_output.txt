Before evaluating whether the issue has been resolved, let's examine the provided information step-by-step:

1. **Bug Description**: 
   - The issue arises because the `trim_docstring` function incorrectly calculates indentation when the first line of a docstring is not empty, leading to errors in docstring rendering.
   - The proposed fix involves modifying the `trim_docstring` function to skip the first line when calculating indentation.

2. **Reproduce Test**: 
   - The test is designed to simulate the error by processing a docstring with content on the first line.
   - If this results in an exception being raised, the issue would still be present.

3. **Original Output**: 
   - The test script fails with an `ImportError` for `simplify_exception`, which does not test the primary issue related to `trim_docstring`.

4. **Patch Context**: 
   - The patch modifies `trim_docstring` to start calculating indentation from the second line onward.
   - Theoretical context suggests this would mitigate the original issue of improper docstring processing.

5. **Patched Output**: 
   - The patched output also experiences the same `ImportError`, meaning the test did not run successfully due to this unrelated issue.

Based on the analysis:

- The test fails for a reason unrelated to the modification meant to address the original bug.
- The test never actually reaches the point of verifying whether the change in the `trim_docstring` function resolves the issue in question, due to the `ImportError`.

Therefore, without a successful execution of the test past the import error, it cannot be definitively concluded that the patch resolves the reported issue with docstring rendering.

Consequently, the answer to whether the issue is resolved is:

Issue resolved: `False`

<ISSUE>
Unable to pass splits to SequentialFeatureSelector
### Describe the bug

This runs fine with e.g. `cv=5`, but according to the documentation, it should also be able to take an iterable of splits.
However, passing splits from the cross validator fails

Im fairly certain I have done similar things in the past to other classes in scikit-learn requiring a `cv` parameter.

If somebody could confirm wether this is a bug, or I'm doing something wrong, that would great. Sorry if this is unneeded noise in the feed.

### Steps/Code to Reproduce

```
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.feature_selection import SequentialFeatureSelector
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import LeaveOneGroupOut

import numpy as np

X, y = make_classification()


groups = np.zeros_like(y, dtype=int)
groups[y.size//2:] = 1

cv = LeaveOneGroupOut()
splits = cv.split(X, y, groups=groups)

clf = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)

seq = SequentialFeatureSelector(clf, n_features_to_select=5, scoring='accuracy', cv=splits)
seq.fit(X, y)
```

### Expected Results

Expected to run without errors

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To address the issue, I need to understand how the `cv` parameter is handled in the `SequentialFeatureSelector` class. Specifically, I want to retrieve the source code related to the `fit` method in the `SequentialFeatureSelector` class because the error occurs during the fit process. Knowing the file path would be helpful, but since it's not provided, I will search for the class and method name in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("SequentialFeatureSelector.fit")
search_class_in_codebase("SequentialFeatureSelector")

class SequentialFeatureSelector(SelectorMixin, MetaEstimatorMixin, BaseEstimator):
    """Transformer that performs Sequential Feature Selection.

    This Sequential Feature Selector adds (forward selection) or
    removes (backward selection) features to form a feature subset in a
    greedy fashion. At each stage, this estimator chooses the best feature to
    add or remove based on the cross-validation score of an estimator. In
    the case of unsupervised learning, this Sequential Feature Selector
    looks only at the features (X), not the desired outputs (y).

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <sequential_feature_selection>`.

    .. versionadded:: 0.24

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : estimator instance
        An unfitted estimator.

    n_features_to_select : "auto", int or float, default='warn'
        If `"auto"`, the behaviour depends on the `tol` parameter:

        - if `tol` is not `None`, then features are selected until the score
          improvement does not exceed `tol`.
        - otherwise, half of the features are selected.

        If integer, the parameter is the absolute number of features to select.
        If float between 0 and 1, it is the fraction of features to select.

        .. versionadded:: 1.1
           The option `"auto"` was added in version 1.1.

        .. deprecated:: 1.1
           The default changed from `None` to `"warn"` in 1.1 and will become
           `"auto"` in 1.3. `None` and `'warn'` will be removed in 1.3.
           To keep the same behaviour as `None`, set
           `n_features_to_select="auto" and `tol=None`.

    tol : float, default=None
        If the score is not incremented by at least `tol` between two
        consecutive feature additions or removals, stop adding or removing.

        `tol` can be negative when removing features using `direction="backward"`.
        It can be useful to reduce the number of features at the cost of a small
        decrease in the score.

        `tol` is enabled only when `n_features_to_select` is `"auto"`.

        .. versionadded:: 1.1

    direction : {'forward', 'backward'}, default='forward'
        Whether to perform forward selection or backward selection.

    scoring : str or callable, default=None
        A single str (see :ref:`scoring_parameter`) or a callable
        (see :ref:`scoring`) to evaluate the predictions on the test set.

        NOTE that when using a custom scorer, it should return a single
        value.

        If None, the estimator's score method is used.

    cv : int, cross-validation generator or an iterable, default=None
        Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy.
        Possible inputs for cv are:

        - None, to use the default 5-fold cross validation,
        - integer, to specify the number of folds in a `(Stratified)KFold`,
        - :term:`CV splitter`,
        - An iterable yielding (train, test) splits as arrays of indices.

        For integer/None inputs, if the estimator is a classifier and ``y`` is
        either binary or multiclass, :class:`StratifiedKFold` is used. In all
        other cases, :class:`KFold` is used. These splitters are instantiated
        with `shuffle=False` so the splits will be the same across calls.

        Refer :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>` for the various
        cross-validation strategies that can be used here.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        Number of jobs to run in parallel. When evaluating a new feature to
        add or remove, the cross-validation procedure is parallel over the
        folds.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    Attributes
    ----------
    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`. Only defined if the
        underlying estimator exposes such an attribute when fit.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

        .. versionadded:: 1.0

    n_features_to_select_ : int
        The number of features that were selected.

    support_ : ndarray of shape (n_features,), dtype=bool
        The mask of selected features.

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

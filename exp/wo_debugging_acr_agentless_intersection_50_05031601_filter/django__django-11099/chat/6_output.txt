To determine whether the issue is fixed, let's evaluate the changes made by the patch and the test results before and after applying the patch.

### Patch Analysis

The patch modifies the regex patterns in the username validators from:

```python
regex = r'^[\w.@+-]+$'
```

to:

```python
regex = r'\A[\w.@+-]+\Z'
```

This change is consistent with the recommended solution in the issue description, where `\A` and `\Z` are used to ensure the username doesn't match a trailing newline. This seems correct and should address the problem described.

### Test Output Analysis

#### Original Output

Before applying the patch, the test fails with an `AssertionError` because the validator does not raise an error for a username ending with a newline, indicating that the issue was present, as expected.

#### Patched Output

After applying the patch, the test results in a different kind of failureâ€”a `ValidationError` is raised, which indicates that the validators are now correctly identifying usernames with trailing newlines as invalid. However, this leads to an issue within the test code itself, where reading Django settings fails due to an improper configuration of environment variables. This is unrelated to the core issue regarding newline handling in usernames.

### Conclusion

The test code requires proper Django settings to execute correctly, but the specific failure related to newline validation has been resolved. The patched regex has effectively caught the trailing newline, as evidenced by the `ValidationError`.

Therefore, despite the configuration error in the testing environment, the primary issue of preventing trailing newlines in usernames seems to be addressed by the patch.

Issue resolved: `True`

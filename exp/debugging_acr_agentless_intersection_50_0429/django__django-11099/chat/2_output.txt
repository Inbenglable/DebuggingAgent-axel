Based on the provided information, the runtime error message indicates a `NameError` for the `sys` module in the `run_debugging_test.py` file. This error occurs because the `sys` module is utilized within the method `debugging_test_execution_wrapper`, but it hasn't been imported at the beginning of the script. The error is preventing the script from running and testing the original issue with the Django validators.

The fixing process should be tackled in two steps:
1. Import `sys` at the beginning of the `run_debugging_test.py` file to resolve the immediate `NameError`.
2. Once the test runs correctly, if the test reveals issues with the regex, update the regex pattern in Django's `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` as originally noted.

However, in this particular case, we should first analyze and fix the `NameError` to allow the script to execute and run the tests on the validators.

Since the runtime error appears specifically because the `sys` module is not imported, we can quickly identify this as the stopping point for the issue:

Buggy method: `run_debugging_test.py:debugging_test_execution_wrapper`

To resolve this issue, ensure that the `sys` module is imported at the top of the `run_debugging_test.py` script. Once the `NameError` is fixed, rerun the script to see if it propagates any new errors or outputs related to the original regex validator issue.

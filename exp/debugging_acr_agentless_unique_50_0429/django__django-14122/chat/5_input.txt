You need to trace the abnormal program to resolve project issues and submit pull requests.
Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Meta.ordering fields must not be included in GROUP BY clause
Description
	
This continues (closed) [1] ticket.
I beleave it was not properly fixed in commit [0ddb4ebf].
While commit [0ddb4ebf] removes ORDER BY when Meta.ordering is used it still does populates GROUP BY with Meta.ordering fields thus leads to wrong aggregation.
PR with test case was added at [2].

This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
Based on the test, it seems there is an issue with the SQL query's `GROUP BY` clause. The problem is related to the fields defined in `Meta.ordering` being included in the `GROUP BY` clause when they shouldn't be. 

Now, given the error mentioned initially, the observed behavior seems to be tied to query construction inside the Django ORM. It's likely in the SQL generation for `GROUP BY` clauses. The Django code segment handling this might incorrectly include fields specified in `Meta.ordering`.

Examining how queries are handled in Django, the code that constructs SQL queries for aggregation, including `GROUP BY`, usually resides in query classes like `Query` or `SQLCompiler`.

To further trace why `Meta.ordering` fields are incorrectly included in the `GROUP BY`, we need to observe the method responsible for assembling the SQL `GROUP BY` statement:

Observed method: `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py:SQLCompiler.get_group_by`
==================================================
The observed code in the `SQLCompiler.get_group_by` method is responsible for constructing the `GROUP BY` clause in SQL queries. The logic attempts to ensure that the `GROUP BY` clause includes the necessary columns based on the query context, such as selected fields, ordering, and having filters.

From the description of the issue, it seems that fields specified in the `Meta.ordering` attribute are incorrectly being added to the `GROUP BY` clause when they shouldn't be. This could lead to erroneous results in queries that use aggregation.

In the current runtime trace, it appears that there may not have been an instance where `order_by` is non-empty or `self.query.group_by` triggers the more complex logic beyond line 101, as all current traces return early for queries without `group_by` or `order_by`. It is likely necessary to delve deeper into how `order_by` is constructed and manage its usage in `get_group_by`.

The next step involves examining in more detail how the method behaves when fields from `Meta.ordering` are indeed expected to be added to `order_by`, potentially exploring sections where `order_by` factors into `GROUP BY`.

Let's dive deeper into understanding how fields in `Meta.ordering` potentially add to `order_by` by examining the broader scope from lines 128 to 133, which look at `order_by` and its impact:

```plaintext
Observed scope: django/db/models/sql/compiler.py:128-133
```
==================================================


Now you choose SQLCompiler.get_group_by's code snippet 
   128	        for expr, (sql, params, is_ref) in order_by:
   129	            # Skip References to the select clause, as all expressions in the
   130	            # select clause are already part of the group by.
   131	            if not is_ref:
   132	                expressions.extend(expr.get_group_by_cols())
   133	        having_group_by = self.having.get_group_by_cols() if self.having else ()

for further observation, tracing the abnormal program behavior.

This is the runtime information of the code snippet you choose to observed in SQLCompiler.get_group_by:

You need to trace the abnormal program behavior step by step to identify the root cause of the bug and locate the buggy method that contains the code to be fixed.
Now, please first analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior. 

Then, if you can already locate the buggy method and buggy code, reply with:
Buggy method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Otherwise, continue tracing by selecting the next method to observe. Reply with: 
Observed method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Note that {FILE_PATH} refers to the path relative to the repository. And if you want to observe a method inside a class, please specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME.

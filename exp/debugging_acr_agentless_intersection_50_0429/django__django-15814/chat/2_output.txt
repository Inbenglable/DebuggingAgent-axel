Based on the provided trace, the issue seems to occur when setting up the Django environment. The error indicates a missing module named 'your_project', which suggests that the Django settings module is incorrectly specified or not set up in the testing environment.

The problem arises when running the `django.setup()` function in the test script located at `/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-15814/reproduce.py`. The line responsible for setting the Django settings module is:
```python
os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "your_project.settings")
```

The placeholder "your_project" should be replaced with the actual project name used in the test or script where this code is executed. This error is not directly connected to the `QuerySet.only()` or `select_related()` methods but rather to an incorrect setup of the Django environment.

To resolve this and properly trace the behavior relevant to the reported problem, the testing environment needs to be correctly set up with actual Django settings. Therefore, adjustments in the test setup are necessary before continuing the specific method trace.

Since the observed behavior is due to a misconfiguration and not the method trace within Django's query mechanism, I'll proceed with tracing the `custom` field's query logic that led to this issue.

Next, I'll observe the method responsible for fetching related model fields and populators that may involve proxy models, which is `get_related_populators`.

Observed method: `django/db/models/query.py:get_related_populators`

The issue arises when using the `units.quantity_input` decorator on a constructor with a return type hint of `None`. The error occurs because the decorator is attempting to call the `.to()` method on the return value which is `None`, resulting in an `AttributeError`.

The stack trace provided outlines several method calls, eventually leading to the error occurring within the `astropy.units.decorators.py` file, specifically in a function used by the decorator.

Here's a breakdown of the observed methods:

1. The execution starts with the `PoC.__init__` method which is decorated with `@u.quantity_input`.
2. The error trace then includes calls from the `astropy.utils.decorators` and `astropy.units.decorators` modules.
3. Finally, the error manifests in the `astropy.units.decorators.py` file, within a line returning `return_.to(wrapped_signature.return_annotation)`.

From the trace, it appears that the error relates to the handling of the return value within a function in `astropy.units.decorators.py`.

Observed method: `astropy/units/decorators.py:wrapper` 

This method should be checked next to understand how the return value is processed, potentially identifying the point where `None` is mishandled.

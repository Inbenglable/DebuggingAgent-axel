To address the issue, we need to inspect the implementation of the `get_feature_names` method in the `CountVectorizer` class. This will help us understand how the `NotFittedError` is raised and how we can modify the behavior to avoid this error when the custom vocabulary is provided.

First, I need to retrieve the source code for the `get_feature_names` method within the `CountVectorizer` class. I will search for this method's code to make the necessary modifications.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("CountVectorizer.get_feature_names")
```

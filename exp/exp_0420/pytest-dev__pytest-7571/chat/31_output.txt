The current analysis has led us to the core issue within the `LogCaptureFixture` class and its interaction with log levels through its `set_level` method. Specifically, we'll need to confirm if the initial log levels are correctly recorded before being altered.

Given that `LogCaptureFixture.__init__` initializes the `_initial_logger_levels` to an empty dictionary, it is crucial to trace the `set_level` method to verify if and how `_initial_logger_levels` gets populated.

Below is our next observed method to ensure we are tracing all interactions with `_initial_logger_levels` effectively:

Observed method: `src/_pytest/logging.py:LogCaptureFixture.set_level`

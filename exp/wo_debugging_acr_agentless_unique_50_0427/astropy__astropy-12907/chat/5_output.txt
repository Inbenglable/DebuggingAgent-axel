To effectively address the issue with the `separability_matrix` function, I need to examine the `_cstack`, `_cdot`, and `_arith_oper` functions in the `separable.py` file since they are utilized in the `_operators` dictionary for computing separability matrices. These functions are key to understanding how the combination operators affect nested compound models.

Let's retrieve the source code of these functions to ensure that we have sufficient information to identify the bug and generate a patch.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/modeling/separable.py", "_cstack")
search_method_in_file("astropy/modeling/separable.py", "_cdot")
search_method_in_file("astropy/modeling/separable.py", "_arith_oper")
```

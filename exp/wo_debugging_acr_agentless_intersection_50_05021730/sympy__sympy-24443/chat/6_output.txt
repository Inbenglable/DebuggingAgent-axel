The issue is with how the `_image()` function handles elements in the permutation group. The error occurs when an inverted generator is not correctly identified within the permutation group's generators. The code provided indicates that the issue is inside the `_image()` function where it checks for membership in generators.

The faulty part of the code is:

```python
if isinstance(domain, PermutationGroup) and r[i] in gens:
    s = domain.generators[gens.index(r[i])]
```

The above fails if `r[i]` is an inverted generator, which means the test `r[i] in gens` fails. 

The function needs to account for the possibility of inverted generators. One way to improve this part is to handle the inverses explicitly. 

I now have enough information about the implementation of the `_check_homomorphism` and `_image` methods. 

Ready generation: `True`

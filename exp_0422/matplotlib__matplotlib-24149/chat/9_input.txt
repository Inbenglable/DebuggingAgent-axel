#### ISSUE
[Bug]: ax.bar raises for all-nan data on matplotlib 3.6.1 
### Bug summary

`ax.bar` raises an exception in 3.6.1 when passed only nan data. This irrevocably breaks seaborn's histogram function (which draws and then removes a "phantom" bar to trip the color cycle).

### Code for reproduction

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
f, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.bar([np.nan], [np.nan])
```


### Actual outcome

```python-traceback

   1747                        "support generators as input")
   1748 else:
-> 1749     return next(val for val in obj if safe_isfinite(val))

StopIteration: 
```

### Expected outcome

On 3.6.0 this returns a `BarCollection` with one Rectangle, having `nan` for `x` and `height`.

### Additional information

I assume it's related to this bullet in the release notes:

- Fix barplot being empty when first element is NaN

But I don't know the context for it to investigate further (could these link to PRs?)

Further debugging:

```python
ax.bar([np.nan], [0])  # Raises
ax.bar([0], [np.nan])  # Works
```

So it's about the x position specifically.

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
Analyzing the current observed code and abnormal program behavior:

1. The user is trying to plot a bar chart using `ax.bar([np.nan], [np.nan])`. This results in an exception due to the stop iteration error. 

2. The traceback shows that the error occurs specifically in the `_safe_first_finite` function within `cbook`, called by the `_convert_dx` method in `axes/_axes.py`.

The `_convert_dx` method is attempting to convert the width of the bar and is using `_safe_first_finite` to find the first finite value, which raises `StopIteration` when no finite values are available (in this case because all values are NaN).

The bullet mentioned in the release notes might be related to how NaN values are handled during this conversion. If the code intended to improve handling NaN values causes the exception, it's likely the fix must be applied here.

To continue tracing the abnormal behavior and better understand the failure, I need to observe the `_safe_first_finite` method inside the `cbook`.

Observed method: `lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py:_safe_first_finite`
==================================================
The `_safe_first_finite` function tries to find the first finite value in an input iterable. When passed `[np.nan]`, it raises a `StopIteration`, as there are no finite values in the input. This leads to the exception observed when calling `ax.bar([np.nan], [np.nan])`.

In this context, the faulty behavior results from using `_safe_first_finite`, which does not handle the case when no finite values are found, leading to a `StopIteration` that isn't caught.

### Analysis:
1. The issue starts when `_safe_first_finite` is used to find the first finite value in the input `x0`, which is `[np.nan]`.
2. If no finite values are found, `next()` raises a `StopIteration`, which isn't caught, causing the exception and breaking execution.

### Conclusion:
The bug is likely within the `_safe_first_finite` function. We need to modify this function to handle cases where there are no finite values in the input without raising a `StopIteration`. 

Thus, we have identified the problematic method:

Buggy method: `lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py:_safe_first_finite`

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

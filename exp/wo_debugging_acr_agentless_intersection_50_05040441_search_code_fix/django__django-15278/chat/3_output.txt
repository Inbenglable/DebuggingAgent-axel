To resolve the issue, we need to address the problem of adding a nullable `OneToOneField` to an existing table in SQLite, which currently crashes due to the attempt to add a UNIQUE column using the `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` statement. 

The code from `DatabaseSchemaEditor.add_field` shows that when a field with a non-null default value is added, the table is remade entirely to accommodate it. This remake involves creating a new table with the desired schema and migrating data over, rather than attempting an `ALTER TABLE` operation.

To fix the issue, we need to modify the `add_field` method to handle nullable `OneToOneField` operations similarlyâ€”by remaking the table rather than adding a column directly, thus bypassing the SQLite restriction on adding unique columns in place.

I will retrieve the source code of `DatabaseSchemaEditor.add_field` method to proceed with generating the patch to fix this issue.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py", "add_field")
```

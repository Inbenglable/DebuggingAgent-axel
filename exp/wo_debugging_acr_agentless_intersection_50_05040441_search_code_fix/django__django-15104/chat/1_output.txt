To address the issue, I need to locate and modify the source code where the `KeyError` is occurring. I need to investigate the `only_relation_agnostic_fields` method within the `MigrationAutodetector` class in Django's migrations autodetector module. This is indicated by the traceback provided in the issue description. 

I will retrieve the source code for the `only_relation_agnostic_fields` method to understand its current implementation and apply the suggested correction (`pop` instead of `del`) to handle the `KeyError`.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("MigrationAutodetector.only_relation_agnostic_fields")
```

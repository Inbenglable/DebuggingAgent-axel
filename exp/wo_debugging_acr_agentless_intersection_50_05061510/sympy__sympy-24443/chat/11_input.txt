You are a PR reviewer that needs to review the patch generated by a bug repair agent and determine whether the issue is fixed or not.
This is the bug issue, which is in the **sympy** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
`_check_homomorphism` is broken on PermutationGroups
```python
In [1]: from sympy.combinatorics import *
   ...: from sympy.combinatorics.homomorphisms import homomorphism
   ...: D3 = DihedralGroup(3)
   ...: T = homomorphism(D3, D3, D3.generators, D3.generators)

ValueError: The given images do not define a homomorphism
```

The issue is in the internal `_image()` function, where it handles the case of a `PermutationGroup`:

https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/809c53c077485ca48a206cee78340389cb83b7f1/sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py#L336-L337

When `r[i]` is an inverted generator, the `in gens` test fails.

I think the whole thing can be greatly simplified.

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
## REPRODUCE TEST
```
# reproducer.py

from sympy.combinatorics import DihedralGroup
from sympy.combinatorics.homomorphisms import homomorphism
import traceback
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        D3 = DihedralGroup(3)
        T = homomorphism(D3, D3, D3.generators, D3.generators)
        # If no exception is raised, the issue might be fixed
        print("No exception raised, the issue might be fixed.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except ValueError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The given images do not define a homomorphism")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

And this is the original output when running the test (before applying the patch):
## ORIGINAL OUTPUT

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

```

The repair agent has tried to generate a patch to fix the issue:
## PATCH CONTEXT
<PATCH_CONTEXT>
To resolve the issue with `_check_homomorphism` in handling inverted generators within permutation groups, we need to modify the implementation of the `_image` function to correctly handle these cases. Specifically, we can adjust the logic in such a way that it accurately identifies generators and their inverses, and ensures that any power or inverse power of a generator is correctly translated into the image mapping. Here is the proposed patch:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                if isinstance(domain, PermutationGroup) and r[i] in gens:\n=======\n                if isinstance(domain, PermutationGroup) and (r[i] in gens or r[i]**-1 in gens):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                    s = domain.generators[gens.index(r[i])]\n=======\n                    if r[i] in gens:\n                        s = domain.generators[gens.index(r[i])]\n                    else:\n                        s = domain.generators[gens.index(r[i]**-1)]**-1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Checking for Inverted Generators**: 
   - We expanded the condition to check if either `r[i]` or its inverse `r[i]**-1` is in `gens`, thus allowing for the identification of inverted generators.

2. **Identifying the Correct Generator**:
   - We added a conditional branch inside, which checks if `r[i]` is in the generators (`gens`) or if its inverse is. This correctly assigns `s` as the corresponding generator or its inverse.

3. **Overall Logic**:
   - These changes should simplify how `_image` handles generators and their inverses within a permutation group without affecting other group types. The code now robustly accounts for inverted generators and ensures correct image computation accordingly.

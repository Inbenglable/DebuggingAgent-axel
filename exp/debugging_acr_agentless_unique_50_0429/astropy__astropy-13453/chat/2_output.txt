The provided test script demonstrates that the `formats` parameter is ignored when the `write()` method is used for exporting tables to HTML format in the **astropy** library. The test expects the formatted output to include the string `'<td>1.24e-24</td>'` but finds that the actual output contains the unformatted version `'<td>1.23875234858e-24</td>'`. This indicates the `formats` parameter is not being properly processed during HTML output.

The test fails due to an `AssertionError`, confirming that the current implementation does not apply the `formats` parameter as expected for HTML output.

To trace the abnormal behavior, we need to investigate how the `write()` method processes and applies the `formats` parameter for different formats, especially the HTML format.

Next, I will observe the method responsible for handling the writing process in the **astropy** library to pinpoint where the formats might be getting ignored.

Observed method: `astropy/io/ascii/core.py:write`

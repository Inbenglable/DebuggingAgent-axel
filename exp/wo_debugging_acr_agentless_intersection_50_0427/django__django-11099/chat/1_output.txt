To fix this issue, I need to modify the regular expressions in the `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` classes, which likely reside in `contrib.auth.validators` or a similar location in the Django codebase. I need to obtain the source code for these validators so I can specifically locate and modify the regex patterns.

Therefore, I will begin by retrieving the source code for both validators so I can properly implement the fix.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ASCIIUsernameValidator")
search_class_in_codebase("UnicodeUsernameValidator")
```

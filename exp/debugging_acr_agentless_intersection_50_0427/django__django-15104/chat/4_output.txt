The current trace highlights an issue where the Django settings are not configured, specifically missing the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting, leading to an `ImproperlyConfigured` error. This configuration issue is preventing the script from executing properly and masking the original `KeyError` issue related to the migration autodetector. 

To address the original issue, let's focus on the `generate_renamed_models` method and identify how it attempts to handle the 'to' key in the deconstructed field representation. The method `generate_renamed_models` indeed calls the `only_relation_agnostic_fields` method which is indicated as potentially problematic when interacting with custom field deconstruction.

The current scope takes us to line 476, where a call to `self.only_relation_agnostic_fields(model_state.fields)` is made. This indicates that further understanding of how `only_relation_agnostic_fields` operates can be crucial to resolving the `KeyError`.

Given this context, we should observe the logic within the `only_relation_agnostic_fields` method, particularly around the handling of `deconstruction` and the 'to' key.

Observed scope: `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py:99-160`

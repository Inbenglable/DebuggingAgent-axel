The issue arises from the fact that the Django application registry is not initialized before attempting to execute database migrations. This is indicated by the exception `django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet.` which is thrown during the execution of the method `get_app_configs`.

The error manifests when `get_app_configs` calls `check_apps_ready` at line 145 in `django/apps/registry.py`, and verifies that the applications have not been loaded, resulting in the exception being raised.

The missing initialization step is calling `django.setup()`, which should occur after configuring settings but before using any Django database operations or management commands. This step is critical in standalone scripts to complete the initialization of Django applications.

Therefore, the buggy code is effectively the absence of `django.setup()` in our testing script after settings configuration.

Buggy method: `reproduce.py:<module>`

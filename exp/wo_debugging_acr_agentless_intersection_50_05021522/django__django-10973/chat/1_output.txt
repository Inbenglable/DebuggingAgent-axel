To resolve the issue, I need to analyze and potentially modify the code related to the PostgreSQL backend in Django, specifically the client usage. To achieve this, I'll need to review the relevant method that deals with invoking subprocesses for PostgreSQL client operations. This involves searching for the appropriate method in the `django.db.backends.postgresql` client module, as it might contain the current implementation that needs refactoring with `subprocess.run`.

Since the specific method name isn't provided, I'll start by searching for methods in the `django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py` file, if this file exists. This is typically where client interaction code would reside.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("client")
```

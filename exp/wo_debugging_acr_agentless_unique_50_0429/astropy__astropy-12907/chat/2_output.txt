To resolve the issue, I need to understand how the `_separable` function works, as it appears to be a key factor in computing the separability matrix in the `separability_matrix` function. Let's search for the `_separable` function in the `astropy/modeling/separable.py` file to see its implementation.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/modeling/separable.py", "_separable")
```

[Bug]: wspace and hspace in subfigures not working
### Bug summary

`wspace` and `hspace` in `Figure.subfigures` do nothing.

### Code for reproduction

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

figs = plt.figure().subfigures(2, 2, wspace=0, hspace=0)
for fig in figs.flat:
    fig.subplots().plot([1, 2])
plt.show()
```


### Actual outcome

Same figure independently of the values of hspace and wspace.

### Expected outcome

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
From the test agent's data and the reproduction code, we identify that the issue originates from the `Figure.subfigures` method within the `matplotlib.figure` module. The `wspace` and `hspace` parameters are being passed to the `GridSpec` initialization. However, these parameters seem to have no effect on the layout, seen by the resulting reproducible test output.

Despite `wspace` and `hspace` being set within the `subfigures` method, there's a lack of integration applying them after `GridSpec` instantiation that represents the subfigures. This behavior suggests that the layout management isn't adjusting or implementing these parameters correctly post-GridSpec creation.

The apparent dysfunction might relate to either the instantiation logic within this method or the subsequent use of the constructed `GridSpec` objects. Thus, tracking how `wspace` and `hspace` are applied throughout the method will help verify the understanding or propagation of spacing correctly.

At this stage, the likely buggy method is:

Buggy method: `lib/matplotlib/figure.py:Figure.subfigures`
==================================================

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To address the issue, I first need to retrieve the source code of the `Figure.subfigures` method in the `matplotlib.figure` module. This will help me understand how `wspace` and `hspace` are currently being handled and why they are not affecting the layout as expected.

```python
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/figure.py", "Figure.subfigures")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/figure.py", "Figure.subfigures")
RESULT:
#### lib/matplotlib/figure.py:FigureBase.subfigures
```python
    def subfigures(self, nrows=1, ncols=1, squeeze=True,
                   wspace=None, hspace=None,
                   width_ratios=None, height_ratios=None,
                   **kwargs):
        """
        Add a set of subfigures to this figure or subfigure.

        A subfigure has the same artist methods as a figure, and is logically
        the same as a figure, but cannot print itself.
        See :doc:`/gallery/subplots_axes_and_figures/subfigures`.

        .. note::
            The *subfigure* concept is new in v3.4, and the API is still provisional.

        Parameters
        ----------
        nrows, ncols : int, default: 1
            Number of rows/columns of the subfigure grid.

        squeeze : bool, default: True
            If True, extra dimensions are squeezed out from the returned
            array of subfigures.

        wspace, hspace : float, default: None
            The amount of width/height reserved for space between subfigures,
            expressed as a fraction of the average subfigure width/height.
            If not given, the values will be inferred from a figure or
            rcParams when necessary.

        width_ratios : array-like of length *ncols*, optional
            Defines the relative widths of the columns. Each column gets a
            relative width of ``width_ratios[i] / sum(width_ratios)``.
            If not given, all columns will have the same width.

        height_ratios : array-like of length *nrows*, optional
            Defines the relative heights of the rows. Each row gets a
            relative height of ``height_ratios[i] / sum(height_ratios)``.
            If not given, all rows will have the same height.

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

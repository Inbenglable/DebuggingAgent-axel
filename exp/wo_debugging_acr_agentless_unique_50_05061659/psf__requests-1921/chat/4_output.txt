To resolve the issue described, I need to examine how headers are merged and processed within the `Session` class, particularly in the `merge_setting` function calls related to headers within the `prepare_request` method.

I will start by looking into how headers are set and manipulated, including if there's a specific method or utility function handling the merge process for headers. The `merge_setting` function seems to be crucial here as it's used for headers merging in `prepare_request`.

I need to retrieve the source code for the `merge_setting` function now.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("merge_setting")
```

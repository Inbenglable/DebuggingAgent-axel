I need to locate the relevant part of the code from the `merge_core` function, which was mentioned in the search result above to properly understand how it processes the `combine_attrs='override'` case and resolve the issue. 

Let's proceed with that:

```python
search_method_in_file("xarray/core/merge.py", "merge_core")
```

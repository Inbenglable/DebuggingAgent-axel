To generate the patch, I need to retrieve the source code of the `as_sql()` method from both the `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` classes because these methods are the entry points for addressing the issue of timezone handling. The current issue resides in how these methods use the timezone. I'll proceed to retrieve the source code for these methods.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncDate.as_sql")
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncTime.as_sql")
```

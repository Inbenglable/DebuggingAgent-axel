## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Use proper whitespace in CREATE INDEX statements
Description
	 
		(last modified by Hannes Ljungberg)
	 
Creating an index through:
index = Index(
	fields=['-name’],
	name='idx'
)
Will generate the valid but not so pretty CREATE INDEX statement: 
CREATE INDEX "idx" ON "schema_author" ("name"DESC)
The following would be expected:
CREATE INDEX "idx" ON "schema_author" ("name" DESC)
This was partially fixed for indexes using opclasses in https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/30903#ticket but it introduced a new quirk when opclasses is used without explicit ordering:
index = Index(
	fields=['name’],
	name='idx'
	opclasses=['text_pattern_ops’]
)
Will result in:
CREATE INDEX "idx" ON "schema_author" (“name” text_pattern_ops )
Note the whitespace after text_pattern_ops. When used with a descending order it will look correct. 
Unfortunately in the fix in #30903 it was assumed that the col_suffixes passed to django.db.backends.ddl_references.Columns would be empty for ascending order but instead it will contain empty strings and thus causing this bug. See: ​https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/db/backends/ddl_references.py#L87
The expected output would be:
CREATE INDEX "idx" ON "schema_author" (“name” text_pattern_ops)

</ISSUE>


A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
The error observed in the test script output is due to an incorrect import statement, specifically the absence of the `AddIndex` class in the `django.db.migrations.operations.indexes` module. The `ModuleNotFoundError` indicates that the specified module or class does not exist or the import path is incorrect. 

To trace and resolve the issue, we need to determine where the `AddIndex` class should come from if it existed and whether the module path specified is accurate based on the current state of the Django project structure. This involves confirming if the class `AddIndex` exists in a different module or it should be created to match the operation required.

Given this context, the next step is to check the Django project's current module structure, particularly the migrations operations related to indexes.

Observed method: `django/db/backends/ddl_references.py:Columns` 

This observation is based on the hint given in the issue description about where the incorrect whitespace manipulation occurs for index creation handling, specifically the manipulation within `col_suffixes` in this file. This exploration can help locate where whitespace issues might arise during SQL statement generation for index creation.
==================================================
Based on the provided information, it seems the issue is related to the `Columns` class in `ddl_references.py`, particularly in how the column suffixes (`col_suffixes`) are being appended to column names, which affects the SQL generation by inaccurately appending or missing the required whitespace between columns and their respective attributes (e.g., `DESC`, `text_pattern_ops`).

The key part of the `Columns` class where this behavior manifests is:

```python
def __str__(self):
    def col_str(column, idx):
        try:
            return self.quote_name(column) + self.col_suffixes[idx]
        except IndexError:
            return self.quote_name(column)
    return ', '.join(col_str(column, idx) for idx, column in enumerate(self.columns))
```

Specifically, the problem lies in how `self.col_suffixes[idx]` is appended directly to `self.quote_name(column)`, without ensuring a space in between unless `col_suffixes[idx]` is an empty string.

To further explore and pinpoint the issue, let's focus on how `__str__` constructs the problematic segments of the SQL by analyzing the range that includes the `__str__` method:

Observed scope: `django/db/backends/ddl_references.py:84-91`
==================================================
The observed issue and traceback information highlight a problem in the SQL generation for CREATE INDEX statements, particularly with the `Columns` class in the `ddl_references.py` file. The issue is related to how column suffixes are appended directly to quoted column names, potentially without necessary spacing.

In the observed `Columns.__str__` method, the code:

```python
return self.quote_name(column) + self.col_suffixes[idx]
```

does not handle spacing between `column` and `col_suffixes[idx]`, which can lead to improper SQL syntax, like "`name` DESC" being output as "`name`DESC" and "`name` text_pattern_ops" being output with incorrect spacing.

Currently, based on the analysis:

1. The issue is apparent in the `Columns.__str__` method.
2. The incorrect concatenation without handling spaces could be the root cause of the bug.

At this point, I can locate the buggy method that needs a fix to ensure proper whitespace handling.

Buggy method: `django/db/backends/ddl_references.py:Columns.__str__`
==================================================

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue, I need to modify the `__str__` method of the `Columns` class in `django/db/backends/ddl_references.py` to ensure proper whitespace handling when suffixes are appended to column names.

I will retrieve the source code for this method to generate the patch.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/ddl_references.py", "Columns.__str__")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/ddl_references.py", "Columns.__str__")
RESULT:
#### django/db/backends/ddl_references.py:Columns.__str__
```python
    def __str__(self):
        def col_str(column, idx):
            try:
                return self.quote_name(column) + self.col_suffixes[idx]
            except IndexError:
                return self.quote_name(column)

        return ', '.join(col_str(column, idx) for idx, column in enumerate(self.columns))

```


==================================================

Your Output:
I have gathered the source code for the `__str__` method of the `Columns` class where the issue is present. I am now ready to generate a patch to fix the whitespace handling issue.

Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

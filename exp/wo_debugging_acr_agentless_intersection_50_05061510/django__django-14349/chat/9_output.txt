To determine if the issue is resolved, let's analyze the provided information:

### Patch Analysis

1. **Problem**: The original test cases expected a `ValidationError` to be raised for URLs containing LF (`\n`), CR (`\r`), or tab (`\t`) characters, but the validator did not raise these errors.
2. **Solution**: The patch introduced a check to raise a `ValidationError` if the URL contains any of these characters before proceeding with the rest of the validation logic.

### Test Output Analysis

**Original Output**: 
The test fails and reports:
- `ValidationError not raised for http://www.djangoproject.com/\n`
- `ValidationError not raised for http://[::ffff:192.9.5.5]\n`

This indicates the validator did not flag these URLs as invalid as expected.

**Patched Output**:
The test ran successfully without failures:
- The test case passed with a single output line `.` indicating success, and `Ran 1 test in 0.000s OK`, meaning no assertions failed, and no exceptions were thrown.

### Verdict

The patch correctly implements early rejection for URLs containing LF, CR, and tab characters, as evidenced by the change in test output from failures to a successful run.

Based on this analysis, the test results before and after patching demonstrate the issue has been resolved.

Issue resolved: `True`

To address the issue where `timesince()` raises a `TypeError` with `USE_TZ=True` and a greater than one month interval, we need to ensure that the `pivot` datetime created in the function accounts for the `tzinfo` of the datetime object `d`. This involves adding the `tzinfo` from `d` to the creation of the `pivot` datetime if `d` is timezone-aware. Here is the patch for the issue:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/utils/timesince.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            d.hour,\n            d.minute,\n            d.second,\n=======\n            d.hour,\n            d.minute,\n            d.second,\n            tzinfo=d.tzinfo if is_aware(d) else None,\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch ensures that the `pivot` datetime is created with the correct timezone information if `d` is timezone-aware, which prevents the `TypeError` related to naive and aware datetime operations.

The patch attempts to fix the dimension identification of expressions involving functions such as `exp` within the `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension()` method by analyzing its arguments for dimensionlessness.

**Original Output:**

The original output shows a `ValueError`, indicating that the dimension of `exp(second/(farad*ohm))` is incorrectly identified, which leads to an assertion error confirming that the issue is present.

**Patched Output:**

The patched output shows a `NameError` because `exp` is not defined within the scope of the patched code. This error is likely due to the fact that the patch refers to `exp` directly without importing or passing it properly within the method.

**Issue Analysis:**

The patch does technically aim to address the issue by ensuring the dimensions within function expressions are verified as dimensionless, particularly when the function is `exp`. However, due to a missing import or reference to `exp`, the patch does not execute correctly. The patched output indicates that the modification leads to an unforeseen error before even reaching the original problem with dimension handling.

Given the presence of the `NameError` in the patched output, the patch doesn't fix the issue. The dimension of the expression involving `exp` is not correctly identified due to the patch not functioning as intended.

**Conclusion:**

Issue resolved: `False`

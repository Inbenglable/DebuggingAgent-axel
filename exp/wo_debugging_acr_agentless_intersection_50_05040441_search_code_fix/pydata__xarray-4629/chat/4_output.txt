To assess the provided patch and its effectiveness in fixing the issue, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Issue**:
   - The issue is about the `merge` function with the `combine_attrs='override'` not correctly copying the attributes, leading to unintentional changes in the source dataset when the merged dataset's attributes are modified.

2. **Review the Reproduce Test**:
   - The test creates two datasets (`xds1` with attrs `{'a': 'b'}` and `xds2` with attrs `{'a': 'c'}`), merges them, and then modifies the attribute `'a'` in the merged dataset.
   - The assertion checks that the attribute `'a'` in the original dataset `xds1` remains unchanged, which reflects the intended behavior.

3. **Original Output**:
   - The test fails when the original dataset's attribute is unexpectedly modified, confirming the presence of the bug.

4. **Review the Patch**:
   - The patch modifies the line in `xarray/core/merge.py`:
     - From `return variable_attrs[0]` to `return dict(variable_attrs[0])`, ensuring a new dictionary is created, breaking the reference chain.

5. **Patched Output**:
   - The provided test outputs nothing, indicating no assertion errors, meaning the test now passes. This suggests the patch effectively resolves the issue by ensuring that the merged dataset's attributes are copied rather than referenced.

Given this analysis, the patch successfully prevents changes to the merged dataset's attributes from affecting the original datasets. 

**Issue resolved**: `True`

We have gathered enough information about the `_save` method in the `FileSystemStorage` class and how `file_permissions_mode` is used. Since the key point is that `file_permissions_mode` should default to `0o644` when not explicitly set, we can proceed to generate a patch.

Ready generation: `True`

To resolve the issue, we need to modify the `trim_docstring` function to correctly handle the indentation calculation by skipping the first line. Here's the patch:

```pythony
### django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())
=======
    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the indentation is calculated starting from the second line, thus resolving the issue with the error in docstring rendering when the first line is not empty.

Here is the JSON representation of the search/replace edit:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())\n=======\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

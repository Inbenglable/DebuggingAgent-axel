Based on the information provided:

### Patch Analysis:
- The patch modifies the `MigrationWriter.as_string` method in `django/db/migrations/writer.py`.
- It updates the sorting logic to ensure that `import` statements appear before `from ... import ...` statements.

### Test Output Analysis:
- **Original Output:** The test fails due to a `ModuleNotFoundError`: No module named 'test_app'. This indicates that the setup for the test is incorrect, as the `test_app` module isn't being found or properly created.
  
- **Patched Output:** The test output remains unchanged and still shows a `ModuleNotFoundError`. This indicates that the patch did not affect the ability to run the test successfully. The setup issue with the `test_app` module persists.

### Conclusion:
The patch addresses the specific issue described by reordering migration import statements, but since the test setup fails (both before and after applying the patch) due to a missing module, it's impossible to determine if the patch fully resolves the original issue regarding import order during migration file generation.

**Issue resolved:** `False` 

The test environment needs to be corrected to properly assess the effectiveness of the patch.

To address the issue of the `IndexError` being raised in the `is_fits` function due to an empty `args` tuple, we will add a check to ensure that `args` is not empty before accessing `args[0]`. This way, the code will not try to access an index that doesn't exist.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### astropy/io/fits/connect.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    return isinstance(args[0], (HDUList, TableHDU, BinTableHDU, GroupsHDU))\n=======\n    if args and isinstance(args[0], (HDUList, TableHDU, BinTableHDU, GroupsHDU)):\n        return True\n    return False\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch ensures that `is_fits` only attempts to check the type of `args[0]` if `args` is not empty, which should prevent the `IndexError`.

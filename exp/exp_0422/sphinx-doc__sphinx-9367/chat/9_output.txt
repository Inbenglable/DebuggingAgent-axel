### Analysis of Current Observed Code and Abnormal Program Behavior

#### Key Observations:
- The `visit_Tuple` method in the `_UnparseVisitor` class is responsible for unparsing tuple nodes from AST back to a string representation.
- The method constructs the string by joining the elements of the tuple with a comma and enclosing them in parentheses.
- For single-element tuples, the trailing comma is being omitted because of how the elements are joined and handled.

#### Reason for Incorrect Output:
- The line `return "(" + ", ".join(self.visit(e) for e in node.elts) + ")"` does not specifically handle the case where there is only a single element in the tuple.
- When there's only one element, the `join` method doesn't append a comma after the element, which leads to the incorrect output.

### Conclusion
The issue arises not from parsing but specifically during unparsing in the `visit_Tuple` method. The omission of the trailing comma for single-element tuples is due to the straightforward joining logic, which doesn't account for single-element tuples needing special handling.

### Bug Localization
The buggy logic resides in how the tuple elements are joined within `visit_Tuple`.

### Buggy Method Identification
The buggy method according to the analysis is:

Buggy method: `sphinx/pycode/ast.py:_UnparseVisitor.visit_Tuple`

### Patch Review

The patch modifies the code in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` by changing:

```python
opts = cur_model._meta
```

to:

```python
opts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta
```

This change aims to correctly handle proxy models by accessing their concrete model metadata, addressing the error described in the issue.

### Test Output Analysis

**Original Output:**
The original output reveals a `ModuleNotFoundError` due to the absence of the module named 'your_project'. This indicates that the environment has not been set up correctly to run the test rather than highlighting the actual issue in the Django code.

**Patched Output:**
The output after applying the patch is identical to the original output, showing the same `ModuleNotFoundError`. This suggests that the test still cannot run due to the environmental setup, so the patch's effect cannot be evaluated since the test does not execute the code that has been modified.

### Conclusion

Given that the test output remains unchanged due to a module error and not due to the issue in the code, we cannot determine whether the patch resolves the issue based on the test results. The environmental setup needs to be corrected to see if the patched code runs without encountering the original error.

Until the test environment issue is rectified, we are unable to definitively verify if the original issue with the proxy models is fixed or not.

Issue resolved: `False`

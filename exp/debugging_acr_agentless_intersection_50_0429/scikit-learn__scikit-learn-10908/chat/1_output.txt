The issue stems from the behavior of the `get_feature_names` method in the `CountVectorizer` class when a vocabulary is explicitly provided during initialization. When the vocabulary parameter is given, the `vocabulary_` attribute should be considered as set, allowing `get_feature_names` to return the feature names without raising a `NotFittedError`.

Analyzing the runtime information and the traceback suggests that the call to `self._check_vocabulary()` within the `get_feature_names` method checks for the existence of the `vocabulary_` attribute. However, the `vocabulary_` attribute seems not to be set until after a `transform` operation is performed, even if a vocabulary is supplied during initialization.

Let's trace the method call further to pinpoint why the vocabulary-related logic is insufficient when manually setting a vocabulary.

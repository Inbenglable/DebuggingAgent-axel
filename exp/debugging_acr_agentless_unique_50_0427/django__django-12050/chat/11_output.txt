The test output before and after applying the patch is exactly the same:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-12050/reproduce.py", line 33, in <module>
    class TestModel(models.Model):
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-12050/reproduce.py", line 34, in TestModel
    data = models.PickledField()
AttributeError: module 'django.db.models' has no attribute 'PickledField'
```

The issue here is that the test script references a `PickledField`, which does not exist in the `django.db.models` module, resulting in an `AttributeError`. This means that the test is unable to run successfully, both before and after the patch. As a result, we cannot determine if the patch actually fixes the original issue regarding the coercion of list types to tuples, because the test never reaches the point where this can be evaluated.

For the patch review, the changes made seem logically correct for the described problem:

- The patch attempts to differentiate between lists and other iterables, preserving the input type (i.e., keeping lists as lists and converting other iterables to tuples).

However, given that the test cannot even run, it's impossible to verify whether the patch successfully resolves the issue simply by looking at test results. The `PickledField` needs to be defined or properly imported for the test to proceed without error.

Issue resolved: `False`

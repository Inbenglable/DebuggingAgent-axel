To address the issue, we need to ensure that the mode advertised by `_pytest.capture.EncodedFile` does not falsely include `b` as this suggests binary mode, which can lead to exceptions when the `write` method is passed bytes. Hence, we need to modify the `__getattr__` method to properly adjust the `mode` without `b` if accessed. 

Let's modify the `__getattr__` method to correctly report the mode and potentially refactor the `write` method to be more tolerant if necessary, but initially only mode adjustment should be made.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### src/_pytest/capture.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    def __getattr__(self, name):\n        ...\n=======\n    def __getattr__(self, name):\n        if name == 'mode':\n            return 'r+'\n        return getattr(self.buffer, name)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This adjustment ensures that the `EncodedFile` class advertises its mode correctly as `'r+'`, treating it as a text file instead, which should resolve the current incompatibility with `youtube-dl`. Further testing can ensure no other functionality is impacted by this change.

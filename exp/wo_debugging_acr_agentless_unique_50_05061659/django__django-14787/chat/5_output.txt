Reviewing the patch and analyzing the test output before and after the patch:

1. **Patch Context**:
   - The patch attempts to address the incorrect preservation of function attributes when using `method_decorator` with `functools.partial`.
   - The change involves applying `update_wrapper(_wrapper, method.func)` when `method` is a `partial` object, and otherwise applying `update_wrapper(_wrapper, method)`.

2. **Original Output**:
   - The output indicates an `AttributeError`, specifically stating that a `'functools.partial' object has no attribute '__name__'`. 
   - The error occurs when attempting to access `func.__name__` within the `inner` function of the `logger` decorator.

3. **Patched Output**:
   - The output after applying the patch remains the same as the original output.
   - The `AttributeError` occurs at the same line, indicating the patch did not resolve the attribute preservation issue.

Given that the patched output is identical to the original output, the issue appears not to be resolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

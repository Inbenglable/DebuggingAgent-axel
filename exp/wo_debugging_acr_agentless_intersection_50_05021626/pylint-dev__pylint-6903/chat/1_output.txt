To address the issue mentioned in the pylint project, the relevant part of the code lies in the `_query_cpu` function in the `pylint/lint/run.py` file. I need to retrieve the source code of this function to understand the exact calculation and fix it so that it handles returning zero correctly.

```python
search_method_in_file("pylint/lint/run.py", "_query_cpu")
```

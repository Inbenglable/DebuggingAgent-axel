The immediate issue we're facing is due to the error message: `NameError: name 'sys' is not defined`. This indicates a missing import statement for the `sys` module within the test script environment. However, this is secondary to the larger problem related to the original issue concerning migration import ordering.

The original issue with migrations indicates that the import statement order in automatically generated migration files does not follow the preferred style. The current test setup aims to reproduce this situation by generating a migration file and checking the order of imports. The error related to "test_app" not being found points to possible issues in how temporary apps are set up for testing.

The method we're tracing, `django/__init__.py:setup`, involves setting up configurations, logging, and populating installed apps. There may be an issue with how `apps.populate(settings.INSTALLED_APPS)` is working here, given the current setup for the test case does not seem to recognize "test_app".

To move forward, we need to investigate how the temporary app and its directory are being set up and recognized by Django, particularly focusing on the app population method called in the setup method. This is likely where the app registration issue can be identified. We should observe the method code related to the apps property, `apps.populate()`.

Observed scope: `django/apps/registry.py:populate` may be our next step since it likely handles registration and initialization of apps, including the temporary one we created for testing. Would you like me to proceed with this exploration or provide further clarification on what debug information you need?

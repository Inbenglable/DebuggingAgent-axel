## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
latex() and mul_symbol
The `latex()` pretty-printing function accepts a `mul_symbol` kwarg that must be one of four choices. I would like to be able to supply my own choice which is not in the list. Specifically, I want the multiplication symbol to be `\,` (i.e., a thin space). This is what I mean
```
>>> latex(3*x**2*y)
'3 \\, x^{2} \\, y' # I typed the thin spaces in after the fact
```

Thin spaces are used by sympy to separate differentials from integrands in integrals.
```
>>> latex(Integral(2*x**2*y, x))
'\\int 2 x^{2} y\\, dx' # This thin space is sympy's current behavior
```

Is there a reason why the user cannot supply the `mul_symbol` of their choosing? Or are the 4 choices a historical artifact? I'm willing to attempt making a PR to allow `mul_symbol` to be arbitrary (and backwards-compatible) if such a PR would be considered.

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To address the issue reported in the Sympy project, I need to identify the code responsible for handling the `latex()` pretty-printing function, specifically where the `mul_symbol` keyword argument is processed. This functionality likely exists within a specific file related to LaTeX output or conversions in Sympy.

Since I don't have the required implementation details yet, I will search for the `latex` function's source code in the codebase to examine how the `mul_symbol` functionality is currently implemented.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("latex")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("latex")
RESULT:
#### sympy/printing/latex.py:latex
```python
def latex(expr, **settings):
    r"""
    Convert the given expression to LaTeX representation.

    >>> from sympy import latex, pi, sin, asin, Integral, Matrix, Rational
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, mu, r, tau

    >>> print(latex((2*tau)**Rational(7,2)))
    8 \sqrt{2} \tau^{\frac{7}{2}}

    Not using a print statement for printing, results in double backslashes for
    latex commands since that's the way Python escapes backslashes in strings.

    >>> latex((2*tau)**Rational(7,2))
    '8 \\sqrt{2} \\tau^{\\frac{7}{2}}'

    order: Any of the supported monomial orderings (currently "lex", "grlex", or
    "grevlex"), "old", and "none". This parameter does nothing for Mul objects.
    Setting order to "old" uses the compatibility ordering for Add defined in
    Printer. For very large expressions, set the 'order' keyword to 'none' if
    speed is a concern.

    mode: Specifies how the generated code will be delimited. 'mode' can be one
    of 'plain', 'inline', 'equation' or 'equation*'.  If 'mode' is set to
    'plain', then the resulting code will not be delimited at all (this is the
    default). If 'mode' is set to 'inline' then inline LaTeX $ $ will be used.
    If 'mode' is set to 'equation' or 'equation*', the resulting code will be
    enclosed in the 'equation' or 'equation*' environment (remember to import
    'amsmath' for 'equation*'), unless the 'itex' option is set. In the latter
    case, the ``$$ $$`` syntax is used.

    >>> print(latex((2*mu)**Rational(7,2), mode='plain'))
    8 \sqrt{2} \mu^{\frac{7}{2}}

    >>> print(latex((2*tau)**Rational(7,2), mode='inline'))
    $8 \sqrt{2} \tau^{7 / 2}$

    >>> print(latex((2*mu)**Rational(7,2), mode='equation*'))
    \begin{equation*}8 \sqrt{2} \mu^{\frac{7}{2}}\end{equation*}

    >>> print(latex((2*mu)**Rational(7,2), mode='equation'))
    \begin{equation}8 \sqrt{2} \mu^{\frac{7}{2}}\end{equation}

    itex: Specifies if itex-specific syntax is used, including emitting ``$$ $$``.

    >>> print(latex((2*mu)**Rational(7,2), mode='equation', itex=True))
    $$8 \sqrt{2} \mu^{\frac{7}{2}}$$

    fold_frac_powers: Emit "^{p/q}" instead of "^{\frac{p}{q}}" for fractional
    powers.

    >>> print(latex((2*tau)**Rational(7,2), fold_frac_powers=True))
    8 \sqrt{2} \tau^{7/2}

    fold_func_brackets: Fold function brackets where applicable.

    >>> print(latex((2*tau)**sin(Rational(7,2))))
    \left(2 \tau\right)^{\sin{\left (\frac{7}{2} \right )}}
    >>> print(latex((2*tau)**sin(Rational(7,2)), fold_func_brackets = True))
    \left(2 \tau\right)^{\sin {\frac{7}{2}}}

    fold_short_frac: Emit "p / q" instead of "\frac{p}{q}" when the
    denominator is simple enough (at most two terms and no powers).
    The default value is `True` for inline mode, False otherwise.

    >>> print(latex(3*x**2/y))
    \frac{3 x^{2}}{y}
    >>> print(latex(3*x**2/y, fold_short_frac=True))
    3 x^{2} / y

    long_frac_ratio: The allowed ratio of the width of the numerator to the
    width of the denominator before we start breaking off long fractions.
    The default value is 2.

    >>> print(latex(Integral(r, r)/2/pi, long_frac_ratio=2))
    \frac{\int r\, dr}{2 \pi}
    >>> print(latex(Integral(r, r)/2/pi, long_frac_ratio=0))
    \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int r\, dr

    mul_symbol: The symbol to use for multiplication. Can be one of None,
    "ldot", "dot", or "times".

    >>> print(latex((2*tau)**sin(Rational(7,2)), mul_symbol="times"))
    \left(2 \times \tau\right)^{\sin{\left (\frac{7}{2} \right )}}

    inv_trig_style: How inverse trig functions should be displayed. Can be one
    of "abbreviated", "full", or "power". Defaults to "abbreviated".

    >>> print(latex(asin(Rational(7,2))))
    \operatorname{asin}{\left (\frac{7}{2} \right )}
    >>> print(latex(asin(Rational(7,2)), inv_trig_style="full"))
    \arcsin{\left (\frac{7}{2} \right )}
    >>> print(latex(asin(Rational(7,2)), inv_trig_style="power"))
    \sin^{-1}{\left (\frac{7}{2} \right )}

    mat_str: Which matrix environment string to emit. "smallmatrix", "matrix",
    "array", etc. Defaults to "smallmatrix" for inline mode, "matrix" for
    matrices of no more than 10 columns, and "array" otherwise.

    >>> print(latex(Matrix(2, 1, [x, y])))
    \left[\begin{matrix}x\\y\end{matrix}\right]

    >>> print(latex(Matrix(2, 1, [x, y]), mat_str = "array"))
    \left[\begin{array}{c}x\\y\end{array}\right]

    mat_delim: The delimiter to wrap around matrices. Can be one of "[", "(",
    or the empty string. Defaults to "[".

    >>> print(latex(Matrix(2, 1, [x, y]), mat_delim="("))
    \left(\begin{matrix}x\\y\end{matrix}\right)

    symbol_names: Dictionary of symbols and the custom strings they should be
    emitted as.

    >>> print(latex(x**2, symbol_names={x:'x_i'}))
    x_i^{2}

    ``latex`` also supports the builtin container types list, tuple, and
    dictionary.

    >>> print(latex([2/x, y], mode='inline'))
    $\left [ 2 / x, \quad y\right ]$

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

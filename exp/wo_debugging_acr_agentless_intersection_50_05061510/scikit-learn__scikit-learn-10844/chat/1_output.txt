The issue is related to the `fowlkes_mallows_score` function in the `supervised.py` module of the sklearn project. The problem occurs when very large values lead to integer overflow in the calculation. The proposed fix involves altering the mathematical formula to prevent the overflow.

To resolve the issue, I first need to locate and retrieve the source code for the `fowlkes_mallows_score` function in the `sklearn/metrics/cluster/supervised.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sklearn/metrics/cluster/supervised.py", "fowlkes_mallows_score")
```

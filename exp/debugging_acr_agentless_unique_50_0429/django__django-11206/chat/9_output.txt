The patch modifies the `django/utils/numberformat.py` file to adjust how small decimals are formatted when `decimal_pos` is specified. The patch changes the conditional to allow scientific notation only when `decimal_pos` is not defined.

However, when examining the original and patched test outputs, both outputs indicate that the test script fails due to an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception. This exception is unrelated to the logic modified by the patch; it is due to the Django settings not being properly configured. The outputs before and after the patch are identical, meaning that the test never correctly ran to check the functionality affected by the patch.

To properly verify the functionality of the patch, the environment settings would need to be configured correctly, allowing the test script to execute without hitting the `ImproperlyConfigured` exception. Therefore, based on the provided outputs, the issue cannot be verified as fixed because the test did not run successfully.

Issue resolved: `False`

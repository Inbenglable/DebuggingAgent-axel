#### ISSUE
Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField
Description
	
Let's consider the following operations: 
operations = [
	migrations.AddField(
		model_name="book",
		name="title",
		field=models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True),
	),
	migrations.AlterField(
		model_name="book",
		name="title",
		field=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True),
	),
	migrations.AlterField(
		model_name="book",
		name="title",
		field=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text="help"),
	),
	migrations.AlterField(
		model_name="book",
		name="title",
		field=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text="help", default=None),
	),
]
If I run the optimizer, I get only the AddField, as we could expect. However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:
optimizer.optimize(operations[1:], "books") 
[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,
 <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,
 <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]
Indeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. 
Is this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? 
Otherwise, would it make sense to add something like
		if isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(
			operation
		):
			return [operation]

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
The observed issue is with the migration optimizer in the Django project, where multiple `AlterField` operations are not being reduced to a single operation when optimized. The `optimize` method of `MigrationOptimizer` is being called with a list of `AlterField` operations, but the output does not combine these into a single operation.

The problem seems to be related to how the optimizer handles consecutive `AlterField` operations. The optimizer is expected to reduce these operations similarly to how it would reduce them if they were following an `AddField` operation.

To understand the issue better, it's necessary to look deeper into the internal workings of the optimizer, specifically how it processes and decides whether to combine multiple `AlterField` operations. This will likely involve examining how the optimizer compares fields and decides operation reductions.

Next, I will need to trace into the `MigrationOptimizer.optimize_inner` method because the main `optimize` method calls `optimize_inner`, which carries out the core logic of the optimization process.

Observed method: `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py:MigrationOptimizer.optimize_inner`
==================================================
The issue seems to be that the `MigrationOptimizer` is not effectively reducing multiple `AlterField` operations into a single operation when they relate to the same field. From the trace and information provided, the `optimize_inner` method is supposed to handle this optimization process.

The key part of the code is where it attempts to reduce consecutive migration operations using the `reduce` method, located at line 47 in `optimize_inner`. For consecutive `AlterField` operations on the same field, the `reduce` method should potentially return a single `AlterField` operation that reflects the cumulative changes. However, in the runtime information provided, we can see that `result` is `False` on line 47, indicating that the `reduce` method does not currently support reducing consecutive `AlterField` operations.

The problematic behavior stems from the current implementation of how `AlterField` operations get reduced, which is determined by the `reduce` method of those operations. Since the `optimize_inner` method delegates this responsibility to each operation's `reduce` method, the suspect area is likely the `AlterField.reduce` method.

Buggy method: `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py:AlterField.reduce`
==================================================


Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

### IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

### IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

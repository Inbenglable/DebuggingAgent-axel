To address the issue, I have gathered the code for the `AlterField.reduce` method. The method handles the optimization of migration operations, and it currently covers cases for removal and renaming of fields but does not specifically handle cases where multiple `AlterField` operations occur for the same field.

Before generating the patch, I need to gather some more context, particularly about `is_same_field_operation`, which is used to check if two operations affect the same field. This check is crucial for determining if multiple `AlterField` operations can be merged into a single operation.

I'll proceed to gather the source code for the `is_same_field_operation` method.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("is_same_field_operation")
```

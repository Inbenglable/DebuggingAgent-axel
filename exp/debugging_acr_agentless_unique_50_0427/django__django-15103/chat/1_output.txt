The primary issue here is that the `json_script` template tag is not available for use. The error message indicates that `'django.core.templatetags.json_script' is not a registered tag library`.

The given stack trace shows an attempt to load `json_script` from `django.core.templatetags`, which doesn't exist. This indicates a mistake in how the `json_script` functionality is referenced. This is the primary reason why the `TemplateSyntaxError` is being raised.

Moreover, the test expects `json_script` to work without providing an `element_id`, which aligns with the request to make this argument optional.

Given these observations, the current issue is with the non-existence or incorrect loading of `json_script`. The error is most likely due to either the absence of the `json_script` tag in the specified library or an incorrect path/reference used in the template `{% load ... %}` tag.

Observed method: `django/template/defaulttags.py:find_library`
This method is part of the traceback during the attempt to load `json_script`. It plays a role in determining whether a library is loaded successfully or not. Investigating this can shed light on why the tag is not found.

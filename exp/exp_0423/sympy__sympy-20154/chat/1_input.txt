You are a debugging agent tasked with precisely using tools to resolve issues and submit pull requests.

**Current Task:**  
Resolve the following issue in the sympy project:
#### ISSUE
partitions() reusing the output dictionaries
The partitions() iterator in sympy.utilities.iterables reuses the output dictionaries. There is a caveat about it in the docstring. 

I'm wondering if it's really that important for it to do this. It shouldn't be that much of a performance loss to copy the dictionary before yielding it. This behavior is very confusing. It means that something as simple as list(partitions()) will give an apparently wrong result. And it can lead to much more subtle bugs if the partitions are used in a nontrivial way. 


Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:

import traceback
import sys
from sympy.utilities.iterables import partitions

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Create a list of partitions of 4
    part_list = list(partitions(4))
    
    # Modify the first partition dictionary
    part_list[0][1] = 100
    
    # Check if the modification affected the generator's internal state
    for i, p in enumerate(partitions(4)):
        if i == 0 and p[1] == 100:
            # If the first partition has been modified, it means the dictionary is reused
            e = AssertionError("The partitions() iterator reuses the output dictionaries.")
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

**Test Execution Results:**

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/sympy__sympy-20154/reproduce.py", line 31, in <module>
    main()
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/sympy__sympy-20154/reproduce.py", line 24, in main
    if i == 0 and p[1] == 100:
KeyError: 1


Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

1. Create a minimal debugging test based on the reproduce test.
2. Debug by reviewing the relevant source code and monitoring runtime information.
3. Once you have identified the root cause, modify the code with minimal changes.
4. Rerun the reproduction script to confirm that the issue is fixed.

Focus on Step 1: generate a debugging test. At the end of your analysis, provide the specific code in the following **JSON format**.
Note: You should clearly specify the tests you are debugging as much as possible. Minimizing the amount of code will better assist you in analyzing runtime information later.

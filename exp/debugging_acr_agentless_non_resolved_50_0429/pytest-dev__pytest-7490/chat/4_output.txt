The runtime information shows that pytest is failing to locate the test specified as `reproducer.py::test_xfail_test`. This indicates an issue likely within the test discovery mechanism, where pytest fails to resolve or locate the test path correctly.

The test session reflects that no tests were collected and that a `UsageError` is thrown because the test file and function specified are not being found. The modification to `args` indicates the inclusion of additional flags and arguments for testing.

Given this failure is occurring after the `_prepareconfig` method when pytest attempts to locate the specified test file path, the issue might be related to how paths are resolved or incorporated as test items within pytest's collection mechanism.

To proceed, I'll need to trace the test discovery and collection process that follows `_prepareconfig`, focusing on how pytest interprets and attempts to locate the test paths provided.

Observed method: `src/_pytest/config/__init__.py:get_plugin_manager` 

This method involves plugin manager handling, potentially important for both test collection and resolution activities within pytest. Letâ€™s observe how the plugin management and path resolution unfolds post `_prepareconfig`.

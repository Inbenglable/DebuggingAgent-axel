The issue occurs because the test script attempts to use the `submit_row` function from `admin_modify.py`, where the function accesses a key `has_view_permission` within the `context` dictionary, but this key is not provided in the context during the test execution.

Let's analyze the provided error trace step-by-step:

1. The test script defines a function `debug_test_show_save_as_new` that constructs a context dictionary lacking the `has_view_permission` key, then invokes the `submit_row` method.
2. Within the `submit_row` function in `admin_modify.py`, the execution tries to access the `has_view_permission` key, which raises a `KeyError` because it doesn't exist in the provided context dictionary during this test run.

Given the above exploration, we can pinpoint the method where the issue occurs:

Buggy method: `django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py:submit_row`

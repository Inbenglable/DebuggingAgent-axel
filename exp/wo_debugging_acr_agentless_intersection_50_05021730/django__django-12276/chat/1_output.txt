To resolve the issue with `ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute()`, I need to review the source code for the `use_required_attribute` method specifically in the context of `ClearableFileInput` and `FileInput` classes. Therefore, I need to retrieve the code for these classes and the method in question.

Let's obtain the source code for `use_required_attribute` and related classes.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "ClearableFileInput")
search_class_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "FileInput")
search_method_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute")
search_method_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "FileInput.use_required_attribute")
```

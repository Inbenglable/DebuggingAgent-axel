Analyzing the provided script and its execution path, the function of interest here is `Mod.do_it` inside `sympy/core/mod.py`. The test case fails because the expression `Mod(3*i, 2)` is not being simplified to `Mod(i, 2)`. The logic responsible for simplifying modular arithmetic expressions involving symbolic variables would be implemented in the `do_it` method, which handles such transformations.

Given the issue presented and the suggested fix, it indicates that a change is required where a factor multiplied with a variable (like `3*i`) should be reduced within the modulo context to just `i` when the multiplier (`3` in this case) is irrelevant due to the modulo. This suggests a logical gap in the `do_it` method.

Therefore, to further trace the abnormal behavior, observe:

Observed method: `sympy/core/mod.py:do_it`

Now You need to reolve the following issue in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Model Field.__hash__() should be immutable.
Description
	
Field.__hash__ changes value when a field is assigned to a model class.
This code crashes with an AssertionError:
from django.db import models
f = models.CharField(max_length=200)
d = {f: 1}
class Book(models.Model):
	title = f
assert f in d
The bug was introduced in #31750.
It's unlikely to have been encountered because there are few use cases to put a field in a dict *before* it's assigned to a model class. But I found a reason to do so whilst implementing #26472 and the behaviour had me stumped for a little.
IMO we can revert the __hash__ change from #31750. Objects with the same hash are still checked for equality, which was fixed in that ticket. But it's bad if an object's hash changes, since it breaks its use in dicts.

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
I need to retrieve the source code for the `__hash__` method in the `Field` class, as the issue involves changes made to it. This will allow me to analyze what changes were introduced and how to revert them.

Let's start by locating the `__hash__` method in the context of the `Field` class within the Django project.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("Field.__hash__")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("Field.__hash__")
RESULT:
#### django/db/models/fields/__init__.py:Field.__hash__
```python
    def __hash__(self):
        return hash((
            self.creation_counter,
            self.model._meta.app_label if hasattr(self, 'model') else None,
            self.model._meta.model_name if hasattr(self, 'model') else None,
        ))

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

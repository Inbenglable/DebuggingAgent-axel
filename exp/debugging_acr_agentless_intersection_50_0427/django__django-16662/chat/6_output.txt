Based on the provided trace and context, the issue arises when executing the `makemigrations` command, specifically within the `django.core.management.commands.makemigrations` module. The Django management command `makemigrations` is intended to generate migrations for the specified app, but instead encounters an `EOFError`, suggesting it's awaiting input as part of its execution process.

The error trace indicates that this EOFError occurs in the method responsible for handling input prompts during the migration autodetection phase. Specifically, the exception is raised from the `questioner.py` module, when attempting to read a line of input.

To resolve this, we need to trace further into the `makemigrations` command's handling of migration generation, particularly focusing on how it deals with input prompts. The problematic behavior is likely within a method that deals with interaction or input requests in a non-interactive environment when the `makemigrations` command is executed.

Observed method: `django/db/migrations/questioner.py:_boolean_input`

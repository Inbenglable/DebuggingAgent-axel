To proceed with fixing the problem in the `_cstack` method, I need to retrieve the source code of this method from the `astropy/modeling/separable.py` file to confirm the observations made and understand the exact current logic.

Let's retrieve the source code for `_cstack`:

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/modeling/separable.py", "_cstack")
```

To generate the patch, I need to retrieve the source code for the method that contains the specified line in the issue, which is located in `sklearn/metrics/cluster/supervised.py`. I'll search for the method involving the line mentioned.

```python
search_code_in_file("sklearn/metrics/cluster/supervised.py", "return tk / np.sqrt(pk * qk) if tk != 0. else 0.")
```

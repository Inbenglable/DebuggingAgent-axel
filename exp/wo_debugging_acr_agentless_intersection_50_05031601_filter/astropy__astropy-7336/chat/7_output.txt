To resolve the issue, it is crucial to understand how the `quantity_input` decorator and the related processing (likely within `make_function_with_signature` or similar functionality) handle return values. We need to inspect the method that is directly related to this error, which seems to be wrapped by a decorator that incorrectly checks return values for constructors.

I'll start by looking into the `quantity_input` method's implementation to determine how it handles return annotations. Additionally, I will explore the affected code paths from the traceback: `astropy/utils/decorators.py` and `astropy/units/decorators.py`.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("quantity_input")
search_code_in_file("astropy/utils/decorators.py", "def __init__")
search_code_in_file("astropy/units/decorators.py", "return_.to(wrapped_signature.return_annotation)")
```

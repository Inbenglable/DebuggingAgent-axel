To address the issue, I need to examine the implementation of the `posify` function in the SymPy project. Understanding the current behavior of this function will help in determining why it does not preserve certain assumptions, such as `is_finite`. Therefore, I should first retrieve the source code of the `posify` function. Since the file path is not given, I'll search for the method in the whole project codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("posify")
```

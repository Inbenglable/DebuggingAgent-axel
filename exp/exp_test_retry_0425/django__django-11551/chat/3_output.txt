To generate an accurate patch for resolving the admin.E108 error issue in Django's `_check_list_display_item` method, I need to first obtain the source code of this method. I will search for this method within its specified file path.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/admin/checks.py", "_check_list_display_item")
```

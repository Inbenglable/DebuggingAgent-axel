From the information retrieved, I have identified how the `fit_predict` and `predict` methods work in the `GaussianMixture` class in scikit-learn.

The crux of the problem seems to stem from the `fit_predict` method performing an additional E-step at its conclusion, which might lead to discrepancies with the `predict` method when `n_init > 1`. After the best initialization is determined and parameters are set, `fit_predict` executes an E-step to ensure consistency, which might be different from what `predict` calculates due to the effect of another initialization round. 

To resolve the issue, we can ensure that these two methods yield consistent results by modifying the `fit_predict` method to call the `predict` method at the end instead of directly performing an E-step.

I will proceed to generate the patch to address this inconsistency in the `fit_predict` method by modifying it to use the `predict` method after fitting the model.

Ready generation: `True`

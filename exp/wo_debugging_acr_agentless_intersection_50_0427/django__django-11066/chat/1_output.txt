To resolve the issue, I need to review the source code of the `_rename` method within the `RenameContentType` class to ensure it contains the correct `content_type.save` statement. 

I will use the search API to locate the class and method in the specified file.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/contrib/contenttypes/management/__init__.py", "RenameContentType")
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/contenttypes/management/__init__.py", "_rename")
```

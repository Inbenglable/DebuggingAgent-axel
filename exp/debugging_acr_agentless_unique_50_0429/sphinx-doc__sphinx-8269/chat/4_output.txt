I have identified the method `check_anchor` in `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py` as responsible for checking the presence of anchors in response data. However, to properly address the issue, I need to locate and understand the code that handles link checking and determines whether the response is an HTTP error or a missing anchor error. This might help adjust the error reporting logic accordingly.

Given this, I need to search for additional methods in `linkcheck.py` that handle link checking logic to understand how to integrate HTTP error checking.

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py", "check")
search_method_in_file("sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py", "run")
search_method_in_file("sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py", "process_result")
```

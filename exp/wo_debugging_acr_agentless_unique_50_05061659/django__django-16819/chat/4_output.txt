Let's analyze each of the API returned contents for relevance in addressing the issue of reducing AddIndex/RemoveIndex migration operations:

1. **reproduce.py:14-20**:  
   This snippet simulates a migration file that has excessive AddIndex/RemoveIndex operations. While it mentions AddIndex/RemoveIndex operations, it is not related to the optimization or handling of these operations in the codebase, so it is irrelevant.

2. **tests/migrations/test_autodetector.py:2615-2621**:  
   This snippet tests migration changes to ensure the expected number and types of migrations including RemoveIndex. It is relevant as it might provide insights or validation regarding RemoveIndex operations during migrations.

3. **tests/migrations/test_operations.py:3132-3138**:  
   This snippet tests the RemoveIndex operation, which is relevant since it might provide information about how RemoveIndex operations are used or verified in tests.

4. **tests/migrations/test_optimizer.py:1168-1174**:  
   This snippet includes RemoveIndex in a test for migration operations optimization, directly relevant to the issue as it deals with the optimization of migration operations involving RemoveIndex.

5. **tests/postgres_tests/test_operations.py:20-26**:  
   This snippet does not seem directly relevant as it lists various migration operations including RemoveIndexConcurrently, focusing more on PostgreSQL-specific operations, which might not directly impact Django's migration optimization strategies.

6. **django/db/migrations/autodetector.py:1320-1326**:  
   This snippet explicitly adds a RemoveIndex operation to the migration plan, indicating its part in the migration process. This is relevant for understanding how RemoveIndex operations are handled by the autodetector.

7. **django/db/migrations/operations/__init__.py:12-18**:  
   This snippet includes RemoveIndex as part of operation imports. While not directly showing handling, it is foundational for where RemoveIndex is defined, possibly relevant.

8. **django/db/migrations/operations/models.py:862-868**:  
   This provides the implementation details of the RemoveIndex operation, which is relevant as it directly defines how RemoveIndex should function within migrations.

9. **django/contrib/postgres/operations.py:4-10**:  
   This snippet lists various migration operations including RemoveIndex. Again, similar to the `__init__.py` file, it is foundational but less relevant unless specific handling logic is involved.

Based on the relevance to the issue at hand:

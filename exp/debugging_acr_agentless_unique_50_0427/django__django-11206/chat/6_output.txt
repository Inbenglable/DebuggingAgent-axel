To address the issue at hand, I need to retrieve the source code for the `format` method in the `django/utils/numberformat.py` file. This will allow me to generate a patch to solve the bug related to formatting very small decimals.

Let's proceed to retrieve the source code for the `format` method.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/utils/numberformat.py", "format")
```

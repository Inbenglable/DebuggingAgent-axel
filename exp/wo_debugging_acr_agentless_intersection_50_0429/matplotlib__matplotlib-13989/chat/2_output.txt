To resolve the issue effectively, I need to investigate the implementation of `hist()` in the matplotlib codebase, focusing particularly on how the `range` and `density` parameters are handled. As the `pyplot.hist` function delegates to what seems like a method within `gca()`, I suspect the actual histogram logic might be implemented elsewhere, likely within the `Axes` module.

I need to search for the `hist` method within the `Axes` class, as that's often where the actual plotting utilities are implemented in matplotlib. This will help me understand how bins are calculated, especially when both `range` and `density` are specified.

Let's proceed to search for the `hist` method within the `Axes` class.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("Axes.hist")
```

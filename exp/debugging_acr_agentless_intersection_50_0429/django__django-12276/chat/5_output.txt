Based on the information gathered, the `FileInput` class does not have its own implementation of `use_required_attribute`, which means it relies on its parent classes. `ClearableFileInput` already has a `use_required_attribute` method that accounts for the presence of initial data, but the suggestion in the issue is to move this logic to `FileInput`.

Let's confirm if there's a base implementation in `Input` that could be affecting this behavior, although it seems unlikely since `Input` itself is a base for more specific widgets such as `FileInput`. However, moving the logic to `FileInput` means creating or overriding a `use_required_attribute` method if it doesn't inherit from a class other than `Input`.

At this point, I'll generate the patch by implementing the logic in the `FileInput` class to prevent displaying the `required` attribute when there's initial data. I'll move ahead since no specific parent implementation contradicts adding this adjustment.

Ready generation: `True`

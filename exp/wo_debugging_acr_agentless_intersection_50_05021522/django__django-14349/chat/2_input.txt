URLValidator tests failing on Python versions patched for bpo-43882
Description
	
On Python versions with a fix for â€‹bpo-43882 (i.e. 3.10.0b1 and the 3.9 git branch, not released yet) the following tests fail:

FWICS, the project is that django rejects URLs based on the split URL components. However, the bpo-43882 fix changes URL splitting behavior to strip all instances of LF, CR and tab characters before splitting, so they never reach the validator.
I'm not sure what the best fix is. One option is to reject URLs containing the forbidden characters early. Another is to go with the new recommendation and assume that LF, CR and tabs are to stripped silently.

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue with the `URLValidator` tests failing, we need to identify where the `URLValidator` is implemented in the Django codebase. From the description, it seems the problem is related to handling forbidden characters (LF, CR, and tabs) in URLs.

I'll start by searching for the `URLValidator` class, as it seems to be the main subject of the problem.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("URLValidator")
```

==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_class_in_codebase("URLValidator")
RESULT:
#### django/core/validators.py:URLValidator
```python
class URLValidator(RegexValidator):
    ul = '\u00a1-\uffff'  # Unicode letters range (must not be a raw string).

    # IP patterns
    ipv4_re = r'(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4]\d|[0-1]?\d?\d)(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4]\d|[0-1]?\d?\d)){3}'
    ipv6_re = r'\[[0-9a-f:.]+\]'  # (simple regex, validated later)

    # Host patterns
    hostname_re = r'[a-z' + ul + r'0-9](?:[a-z' + ul + r'0-9-]{0,61}[a-z' + ul + r'0-9])?'
    # Max length for domain name labels is 63 characters per RFC 1034 sec. 3.1
    domain_re = r'(?:\.(?!-)[a-z' + ul + r'0-9-]{1,63}(?<!-))*'
    tld_re = (
        r'\.'                                # dot
        r'(?!-)'                             # can't start with a dash
        r'(?:[a-z' + ul + '-]{2,63}'         # domain label
        r'|xn--[a-z0-9]{1,59})'              # or punycode label
        r'(?<!-)'                            # can't end with a dash
        r'\.?'                               # may have a trailing dot
    )
    host_re = '(' + hostname_re + domain_re + tld_re + '|localhost)'

    regex = _lazy_re_compile(
        r'^(?:[a-z0-9.+-]*)://'  # scheme is validated separately
        r'(?:[^\s:@/]+(?::[^\s:@/]*)?@)?'  # user:pass authentication
        r'(?:' + ipv4_re + '|' + ipv6_re + '|' + host_re + ')'
        r'(?::\d{2,5})?'  # port
        r'(?:[/?#][^\s]*)?'  # resource path
        r'\Z', re.IGNORECASE)
    message = _('Enter a valid URL.')
    schemes = ['http', 'https', 'ftp', 'ftps']

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

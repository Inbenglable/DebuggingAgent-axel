The issue arises in the `merge_attrs` function where the attributes are not being copied when `combine_attrs='override'` is specified. This results in the merged dataset's (`xds3`) attributes being directly referenced rather than creating a new copy.

From the provided trace information, the problem clearly occurs within the `merge_attrs` function due to the line `return variable_attrs[0]` rather than `return dict(variable_attrs[0])`.

Buggy method: `xarray/core/merge.py:merge_attrs`

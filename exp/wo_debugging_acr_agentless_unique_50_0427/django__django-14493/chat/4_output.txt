I need to retrieve the complete source code for the `post_process` method indicated in the error traceback from the base class in `staticfiles/storage.py`, where the `substitutions` variable is likely being referenced. This will help analyze how the initialization of `substitutions` is currently being handled and where the fix is needed.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py", "StaticFilesStorage.post_process")
```

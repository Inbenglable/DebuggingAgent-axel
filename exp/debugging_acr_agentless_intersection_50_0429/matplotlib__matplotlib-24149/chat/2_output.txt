The abnormal behavior is being triggered by the `_safe_first_finite` function in `lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py`. The function is designed to return the first finite value in the input iterable. However, if the iterable only contains non-finite values (like `np.nan`), it will raise a `StopIteration` exception when it tries to find a finite number but cannot. This is mentioned as a bug in the issue since `StopIteration` is not handled gracefully here. Instead of raising an unhandled exception, the function should likely return a sensible default value when no finite numbers are found, or handle the `StopIteration` exception appropriately.

Given this analysis, I can identify that the buggy method is:

Buggy method: `lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py:_safe_first_finite`

To address the issue with `ModelChoiceField`, we need to determine which of the retrieved contents are relevant and needed for fixing the issue. The issue mentions that the `ModelChoiceField` should provide the value of an invalid choice when raising a `ValidationError`. This aligns with the behavior we see in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py:Field.validate`, where the `validate` method raises a validation error with the value in the message via `params={'value': value}` when invalid choices are detected. This indicates that this content is relevant to fixing the bug with `ModelChoiceField`.

On the other hand, `django/forms/fields.py:Field.validate` does not reference selections and the inclusion of invalid choice values, as it is mainly dealing with required fields.

Therefore, the relevant and needed content to address the issue is:

```
django/db/models/fields/__init__.py:Field.validate
```

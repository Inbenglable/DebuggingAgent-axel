To address the issue with the `trim_docstring` function, I'll create a patch that updates the problematic line where the indentation is calculated to skip the first line as suggested. This patch aims to prevent errors occurring with docstrings that begin with a non-empty first line.

Here's the patch in SEARCH/REPLACE format:

```pythony
### django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())
=======
    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

I'll now provide this edit result in the appropriate JSON format.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())\n=======\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

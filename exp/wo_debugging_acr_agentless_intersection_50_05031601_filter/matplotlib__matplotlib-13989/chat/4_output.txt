The issue pertains to the handling of `range` when `density=True` in the `Axes.hist` method. Our objective is to ensure that the specified `range` is properly respected, even when density calculations are involved.

Let's get started with creating a patch to resolve this issue:

1. Locate where `hist_kwargs` are defined and used in calling `np.histogram`.
2. Ensure that `range` is correctly passed to `np.histogram`, specifically when `density=True`.

Here's the patch that aims to fix this issue:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            hist_kwargs = dict(density=density)\n=======\n            hist_kwargs = dict(density=density, range=bin_range)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

Explanation:

- **SEARCH** line looks for where density-related kwargs are initially configured and used for the histogram calculation.
- **REPLACE** line adds `range=bin_range` to the `hist_kwargs` dict when `density` is involved, ensuring that the range is considered when density is computed.

By applying this patch, we are enhancing the function to respect the given `range` argument regardless of whether `density` is set or not.

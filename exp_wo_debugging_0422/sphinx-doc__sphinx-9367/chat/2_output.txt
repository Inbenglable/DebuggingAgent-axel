We need to understand how the rendering of tuples is handled in the source code that is being tested by `test_unparse` in `tests/test_pycode_ast.py`. The issue might be with the function responsible for unparsing the AST into source code, which is presumably an `unparse` function that needs to handle 1-element tuples correctly.

Let's first retrieve the source code of the `test_unparse` method and any relevant methods or classes involved in rendering tuples.

```python
search_method_in_file("tests/test_pycode_ast.py", "test_unparse")
search_method_in_codebase("unparse")
```

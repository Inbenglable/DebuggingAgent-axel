Based on the issue description, it is possible that the problem lies within the `_sparse_fit` method, which is showing a ZeroDivisionError when the `support_vectors_` attribute is empty. To address this issue, I need to retrieve the source code of the `_sparse_fit` method to understand what changes are required to handle an empty `support_vectors_` without leading to a ZeroDivisionError. Let's search for the method `_sparse_fit` to gather the relevant source code.

Since the file path isn't provided in the issue description, I'll search for the method across the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("_sparse_fit")
```

To resolve the issue, the traceback indicates the problem arises from several functions: `_safe_first_finite`, `_convert_dx`, and `bar`. These functions are likely involved in type conversion and handling non-finite values such as `NaN`. The fix will likely involve modifying these functions to handle `NaN` values gracefully without raising an exception. 

To implement a solution, I first need to gather the source code of these functions to better understand their current functionality and logic for modifications.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("_safe_first_finite")
search_method_in_codebase("Axes._convert_dx")
search_method_in_codebase("Axes.bar")
```

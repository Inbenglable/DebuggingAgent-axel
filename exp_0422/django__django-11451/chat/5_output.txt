To address the issue with the `ModelBackend.authenticate` method in Django, we need to modify the method to return early if either the `username` or `password` is `None`, therefore avoiding unnecessary database operations. Below is the required patch in the *SEARCH/REPLACE* format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/auth/backends.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if username is None:\n=======\n        if username is None or password is None:\n            return\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch modifies the method to include a check that immediately returns if either `username` or `password` is `None`, preventing needless database queries and password hashing.

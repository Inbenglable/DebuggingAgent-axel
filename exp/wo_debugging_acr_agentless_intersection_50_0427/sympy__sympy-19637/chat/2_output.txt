In the provided `kernS` function source code, the issue arises because the variable `kern` is referenced in the line `hit = kern in s` without being initialized when the condition `if ' ' in s:` is not satisfied. The `kern` variable is only assigned a value within that if block.

To resolve this, the `kern` variable should be initialized before entering the if block to ensure that it's always defined before reaching `hit = kern in s`. Here's how we can address this:

```python
kern = ''  # Initialize kern with an empty string or an appropriate default value
if ' ' in s:
    # get a unique kern
    kern = '_'
    while kern in s:
        kern += choice(string.ascii_letters + string.digits)
    s = s.replace(' ', kern)

hit = kern in s
```

This initialization ensures that `kern` is defined even if the condition is not met, preventing the "referenced before assignment" error.

With this understanding, I am ready to generate the patch.

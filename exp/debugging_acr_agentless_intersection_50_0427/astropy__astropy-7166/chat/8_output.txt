To determine whether the issue has been resolved, let's analyze the provided information:

### Review of the Patch

The patch modifies the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass by changing the condition to check if `val` is either a regular function or a property. The specific code change is:

```python
# Original code
if (inspect.isfunction(val) and

# Patched code
if ((inspect.isfunction(val) or isinstance(val, property)) and
```

This modification ensures that both regular functions and properties are considered when attempting to inherit docstrings.

### Analysis of Test Output

#### Original Output
Before applying the patch, the test failed with an `AssertionError` indicating that the property docstring was not inherited:

```
AssertionError: Property docstring not inherited.
```

#### Patched Output
After applying the patch, the output is:

```

```

The empty output after patching suggests that the test ran successfully without any exceptions or assertion failures, indicating that the property docstring was inherited as expected.

### Conclusion

The patch adjusts the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass to include logic for properties, effectively resolving the issue of not inheriting docstrings for properties when using this metaclass. The change allows the test to pass successfully, meaning that property docstrings are now inherited correctly.

Therefore, the issue is resolved.

Issue resolved: `True`

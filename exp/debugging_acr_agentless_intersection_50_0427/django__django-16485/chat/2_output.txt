To resolve the issue, I need to examine the source code of the `floatformat` method in the Django project. The debugging history has already pointed out that the method is located in the `django/template/defaultfilters.py` file. Therefore, I should retrieve the source code for the method using the following API call:

```python
search_method_in_file("django/template/defaultfilters.py", "floatformat")
```

<ISSUE>
partitions() reusing the output dictionaries
The partitions() iterator in sympy.utilities.iterables reuses the output dictionaries. There is a caveat about it in the docstring. 

I'm wondering if it's really that important for it to do this. It shouldn't be that much of a performance loss to copy the dictionary before yielding it. This behavior is very confusing. It means that something as simple as list(partitions()) will give an apparently wrong result. And it can lead to much more subtle bugs if the partitions are used in a nontrivial way. 

</ISSUE>


A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
Analyzing the test script `reproduce.py` alongside the partitions function:

1. **Problem Identification**: The symptom of the problem is that the `partitions()` generator reuses the output dictionaries. This means modifications to one of the yielded partition dictionaries inadvertently affect all future iterations or previously held references, leading to possibly incorrect or unexpected results when those objects are manipulated.

2. **Observed Abnormal Behavior**: 
   - The test checks if modifying `part_list[0][1] = 100` impacts the result produced by re-running `partitions(4)` iterator, which should be independent but isn't.
   - The `KeyError: 1` occurs during the conditional check `if i == 0 and p[1] == 100` in the for loop because partition dictionaries yielded from `partitions(4)` don't have the key `1` for the first partition, which suggests loss of dictionary structure integrity upon reusing.

3. **Initial Analysis of Line-by-Line Execution**:
   - Iteratively yielding partition dictionaries might be providing references to the same dictionary objects without creating new ones for each yield. If true, modifications are reflected across all instances that reference this dictionary, necessitating deep copy prior to yield or restructuring approach to prevent key collisions from mutable operations.

Given the code walk-through, a pattern of dictionary reuse is evident, causing shared state issues reflected by the `AssertionError`.

To resolve this, we should inspect the method responsible for yielding the dictionary in the partitions function located in the `sympy/utilities/iterables.py`.

Buggy method: `sympy/utilities/iterables.py:partitions`
==================================================

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To address the identified problem with the `partitions` function in `sympy.utilities.iterables`, I need to retrieve the source code of the `partitions` method first. This will allow me to examine the current implementation and determine where a deep copy or other modification might be inserted to ensure that unique dictionary instances are yielded each time.

I'll search for the `partitions` method in the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/utilities/iterables.py", "partitions")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_file("sympy/utilities/iterables.py", "partitions")
RESULT:
#### sympy/utilities/iterables.py:partitions
```python
def partitions(n, m=None, k=None, size=False):
    """Generate all partitions of positive integer, n.

    Parameters
    ==========

    m : integer (default gives partitions of all sizes)
        limits number of parts in partition (mnemonic: m, maximum parts)
    k : integer (default gives partitions number from 1 through n)
        limits the numbers that are kept in the partition (mnemonic: k, keys)
    size : bool (default False, only partition is returned)
        when ``True`` then (M, P) is returned where M is the sum of the
        multiplicities and P is the generated partition.

    Each partition is represented as a dictionary, mapping an integer
    to the number of copies of that integer in the partition.  For example,
    the first partition of 4 returned is {4: 1}, "4: one of them".

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.utilities.iterables import partitions

    The numbers appearing in the partition (the key of the returned dict)
    are limited with k:

    >>> for p in partitions(6, k=2):  # doctest: +SKIP
    ...     print(p)
    {2: 3}
    {1: 2, 2: 2}
    {1: 4, 2: 1}
    {1: 6}

    The maximum number of parts in the partition (the sum of the values in
    the returned dict) are limited with m (default value, None, gives
    partitions from 1 through n):

    >>> for p in partitions(6, m=2):  # doctest: +SKIP
    ...     print(p)
    ...
    {6: 1}
    {1: 1, 5: 1}
    {2: 1, 4: 1}
    {3: 2}

    Note that the _same_ dictionary object is returned each time.
    This is for speed:  generating each partition goes quickly,
    taking constant time, independent of n.

    >>> [p for p in partitions(6, k=2)]
    [{1: 6}, {1: 6}, {1: 6}, {1: 6}]

    If you want to build a list of the returned dictionaries then
    make a copy of them:

    >>> [p.copy() for p in partitions(6, k=2)]  # doctest: +SKIP
    [{2: 3}, {1: 2, 2: 2}, {1: 4, 2: 1}, {1: 6}]
    >>> [(M, p.copy()) for M, p in partitions(6, k=2, size=True)]  # doctest: +SKIP
    [(3, {2: 3}), (4, {1: 2, 2: 2}), (5, {1: 4, 2: 1}), (6, {1: 6})]

==================================================

Your Output:
The source code for the `partitions` function has already been retrieved. This code is sufficient to address the issue regarding the reuse of dictionary objects within the function. Based on the analysis, making a copy of the dictionary before yielding will prevent any unintended modifications from affecting other iterations.

Ready generation: `True`

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}

Your response format is invalid: Search pattern not found in file.
Please try again.

Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
Generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* patches to fix the issue.

Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
1. The file path
2. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
3. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
4. The dividing line: =======
5. The lines to replace into the source code
6. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE

Here is an example of a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit:

```python
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask

At the end of your analysis, provide edit result in the following JSON format:

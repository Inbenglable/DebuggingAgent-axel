To address the issue of setting a default permission for uploaded files in Django, I need to verify how Django currently handles file permissions in the `FileSystemStorage` system, including where and how `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is applied. I'll need to further investigate the parts of the Django codebase related to file uploads, such as `FileSystemStorage` and `TemporaryUploadedFile`, to ensure they align with the requested modification.

Here's my plan of action:

1. Locate the FileSystemStorage implementation and understand how file permissions are set during file uploads.
2. Verify if and where `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is used or could be applied in this context.

To proceed, I will search for the `FileSystemStorage` class and examine its code.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("FileSystemStorage")
```

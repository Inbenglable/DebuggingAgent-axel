You are a PR reviewer that needs to review the patch generated by a bug repair agent and determine whether the issue is fixed or not.
This is the bug issue, which is in the **sphinx** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Linkcheck should report HTTP errors instead of Anchor not found
**Describe the bug**
The `linkcheck` command always reports that it was unable to find the anchor when [`linkcheck_anchors`](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#confval-linkcheck_workers) is `True`, even when the server replied with an error status code (e.g. 404, 500).

While it is indeed unable to find the anchor, the real issue is that the server encountered an error.

**To Reproduce**
```console
$ sphinx-quickstart --project proj --sep --author me --release 1.0 --language en
$ # https://google.com/test.txt does not exist, the server replies with a 404.
$ echo '\n`foo <https://google.com/test.txt#test>`_' >>source/index.rst
$ make linkcheck
```

**Expected behavior**
*Actual*
```
(line   22) broken    https://google.com/test.txt#test - Anchor 'test' not found
```

*Expected output*
Same as when `linkcheck_anchors=False`.
```
(line   22) broken    https://google.com/test.txt#test - 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://google.com/test.txt
``` 

**Environment info**
- OS: Linux 5.8.12.a-1-hardened
- Python version: 3.8.5
- Sphinx version: 3.2.1

And this is the original output when running the test (before applying the patch):

```

The repair agent has tried to generate a patch to fix the issue:
## PATCH CONTEXT
<PATCH_CONTEXT>
To resolve the issue, I need to update the link-checking mechanism so that it properly reports HTTP errors such as 404 and 500 statuses, instead of simply reporting "Anchor not found" when `linkcheck_anchors` is `True`. This involves checking the HTTP status code before parsing the content for anchors. If the response indicates an HTTP error, it should be logged and returned accordingly.

### Patch Proposal:

1. **Modify** the `check_anchor` function to first evaluate the HTTP status and report any errors before attempting to parse for anchors.

Let's implement this change:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    parser = AnchorCheckParser(anchor)\n=======\n    # Check for HTTP errors first\n    if response.status_code != 200:\n        return False\n    parser = AnchorCheckParser(anchor)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

### Summary:

- **Add** a check at the start of the `check_anchor` function to verify if the HTTP status code indicates an error (anything other than 200), and immediately return `False` if so. This ensures HTTP errors are captured and processed appropriately. 

With this patch, the link checking will be more accurate and meaningful, reporting HTTP errors directly rather than defaulting to anchor issues when an HTTP error is present.
</PATCH_CONTEXT>

After applying the patch, the output of the test is:
## PATCHED OUTPUT
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/sphinx-doc__sphinx-8269/reproduce.py", line 73, in <module>

    with open(conf_py, 'w') as f:
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/sphinx-doc__sphinx-8269/source/conf.py'

```

Now, please first review the patch and analyse the test output before and after the patch, to determine whether the issue is fixed or not.

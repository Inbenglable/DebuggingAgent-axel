To determine whether the issue has been resolved, let's review the test output before and after applying the patch:

### Test Analysis

1. **Original Output:**
   - The error indicates that the table `__main___timeslots` does not exist: `django.db.utils.OperationalError: no such table: __main___timeslots`

2. **Patched Output:**
   - After applying the patch, the error message is identical: `django.db.utils.OperationalError: no such table: __main___timeslots`

### Patch Review

- The patch modifies the `as_sql()` methods in both `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` classes to correctly utilize the `tzinfo` object passed by the user, which is the intended change based on the problem described.
- However, the issue presented in both the original and patched outputs pertains to a database operational error, specifically the missing `TimeSlots` table, which suggests a problem with the test setupâ€”not the functionality of `TruncDate` and `TruncTime`.

### Conclusion

The ongoing issue (`OperationalError: no such table`) signifies a test setup failure rather than a patch failure on the `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` functionality within Django. The current outputs indicate the test setup did not properly create the table necessary to perform the function and confirm the patch's success.

Thus, based on available evidence, the actual functionality concern about passing `tzinfo` is not actively producing a successful test output due to setup issues, and therefore we cannot conclusively say the issue is resolved since the test cannot run properly to verify this.

**Issue resolved:** `False`

To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code of the `MigrationLoader.load_disk` method in the `django/db/migrations/loader.py` file. This will allow me to understand how the current check is implemented and modify it to make the migration loader more compliant with Python's documented import API.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/loader.py", "MigrationLoader.load_disk")
```

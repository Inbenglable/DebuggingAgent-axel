To address the issue, we need to modify or review the mechanism by which files are uploaded and stored in Django's FileSystemStorage. This will likely involve checking how permissions are set during the upload process. The relevant part of the Django codebase that might need modification is where file permissions are assigned in the FileSystemStorage class.

Specifically, the handling of `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION` might be set in a method related to storing uploaded files. Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code related to FileSystemStorage and look for any method that sets file permissions or handles file uploads.

First, I'll search for the class `FileSystemStorage` to locate its definition in the Django codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("FileSystemStorage")
```

The issue arises in the function `mathematica_code` not correctly converting a `Max` object in SymPy to the expected string format for Mathematica. When converting the expression `Max(x, 2)`, the resulting string is `'Max(2, x)'` which is the standard Python-like syntax with parentheses, not the Mathematica syntax with square brackets.

The function `mathematica_code` is called and a printer object `MCodePrinter` (from `sympy.printing.mathematica`) is used to process the expression. Therefore, we need to examine how the `MCodePrinter` class processes a `Max` expression. This will allow us to identify where the conversion from a SymPy expression to a Mathematica-readable string is not as expected.

Observed method: `sympy/printing/mathematica.py:MCodePrinter.doprint`

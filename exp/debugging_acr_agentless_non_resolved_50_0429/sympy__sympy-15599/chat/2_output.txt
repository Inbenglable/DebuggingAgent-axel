Analyzing the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior:

**Current Behavior:**
- The function `main()` creates a symbolic expression `Mod(3*i, 2)` using SymPy's `Mod` function.
- The expected behavior is for `Mod(3*i, 2)` to simplify to `Mod(i, 2)`. 
- An `AssertionError` is thrown because `Mod(3*i, 2)` does not equal `Mod(i, 2)`, indicating that the `Mod` function is not simplifying the expression as expected.

**Relevant Code:**
- The issue describes a patch in `sympy/core/mod.py` that modifies the `doit` function to handle symbolic expressions involving `Mod` more effectively.
- It also suggests adding a test in `sympy/core/tests/test_arit.py` to verify this functionality.

**Abnormal Behavior:**
- The `Mod` function does not simplify `Mod(3*i, 2)` to `Mod(i, 2)`, which indicates that the simplification logic in `doit` or related methods is not functioning correctly.

**Next Step:**
To better understand how `Mod` handles simplification, I should observe the `doit` method in `sympy/core/mod.py`.

Observed method: `sympy/core/mod.py:Mod.doit`

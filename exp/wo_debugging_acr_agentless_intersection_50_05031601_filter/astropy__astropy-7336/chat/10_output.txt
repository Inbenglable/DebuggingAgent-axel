To address the issue, I need to further investigate the `quantity_input` decorator in the `astropy/units/decorators.py` file to understand how it processes the return values, specifically in conjunction with type hints. Additionally, I'll review the implementation of this decorator more deeply since we haven't retrieved that specific method or its class, which could provide insights into where the return type error occurs.

I'll also need the surrounding context of how these decorators are set up with the `quantity_input` to effectively implement a fix.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/units/decorators.py", "quantity_input")
```

The current observed code is the `LatexPrinter.__init__` method located in `sympy/printing/latex.py`. Upon reviewing the code, we can see that the error arises because the `mul_symbol` setting supplied by the user (`'\\,'`) does not exist in the `mul_symbol_table`. The `KeyError` is raised when trying to access a dictionary key that does not exist, indicating that arbitrary multiplication symbols are not currently supported.

The root cause of the bug is the static nature of the `mul_symbol_table` dictionary, which restricts the `mul_symbol` to predefined options (None, 'ldot', 'dot', 'times'). To support arbitrary multiplication symbols, this dictionary lookup mechanism would need alteration to incorporate any user-supplied symbol directly.

Given this analysis, the buggy method has been identified as:

Buggy method: `sympy/printing/latex.py:LatexPrinter.__init__`

To address this issue effectively, we need to ensure that the `LogCaptureFixture.set_level` method in `src/_pytest/logging.py` is implemented to store the log levels with correct keys and subsequently restore these levels due to `_finalize`.

Since the bug is identified within `LogCaptureFixture.set_level`, I will retrieve the source code for this specific method to identify potential fixes.

Let's proceed by retrieving the source code for `LogCaptureFixture.set_level` method from the `src/_pytest/logging.py` file:

```python
search_method_in_file("src/_pytest/logging.py", "LogCaptureFixture.set_level")
```

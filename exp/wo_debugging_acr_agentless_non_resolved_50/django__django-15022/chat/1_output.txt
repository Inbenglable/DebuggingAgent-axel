The issue described involves unnecessary joins in the admin changelist query due to the way search fields are configured in `ClientAdmin`. The suggested solution involves optimizing the way these queries are constructed to avoid multiple joins for each word in the search query.

Before generating the patch, it's helpful to understand how the admin panel constructs these queries, specifically the filter operations that translate each search term into an SQL join. We need to examine the code that handles `search_fields` in Django's admin module.

I will now retrieve the source code that might be responsible for handling these search fields in the Django admin module to analyze it further.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("filter")
search_class_in_codebase("ModelAdmin")
```

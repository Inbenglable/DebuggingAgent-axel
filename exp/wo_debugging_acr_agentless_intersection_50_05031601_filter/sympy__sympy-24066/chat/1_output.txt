To resolve the issue, I need to understand the implementation of the `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension()` method. Additionally, understanding the `exp()` function from the sympy library might be useful. Since the class `SI` is already mentioned, it is better to search for the method within this class. Therefore, I will use the API to retrieve the source code related to this method.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("SI._collect_factor_and_dimension")
```

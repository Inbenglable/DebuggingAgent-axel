Based on the tracing and analysis history, the core issue arises because the multiplication operation involving a scalar and a `Point` object (in the reverse order `sympify(2.0) * point2`) results in a `Mul` object. This `Mul` object is not properly handled by the `Point.__add__` method, leading to a `GeometryError`.

The multiplication operation doesn't route through the `Point.__mul__` directly when a scalar is on the left. Instead, it results in a `Mul` object that isn't expected by the `Point.__add__`. Hence, the handling in `Point.__add__`, particularly when dealing with a `Mul` object, needs to be addressed.

Given the analysis, the identified problematic handling is within the `__add__` method of the `Point` class, as it fails to recognize and adapt to a `Mul` object type being used as an operand resulting from reverse multiplication.

Therefore, the buggy method is:

Buggy method: `sympy/geometry/point.py:Point.__add__`

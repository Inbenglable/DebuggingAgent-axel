To resolve the issue, I need to review the source code of the `kahane_simplify` function to understand how the leading gamma matrices are being handled and potentially reversed. Since the function's file path isn't specified, I need to search for the method in the whole project codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("kahane_simplify")
```

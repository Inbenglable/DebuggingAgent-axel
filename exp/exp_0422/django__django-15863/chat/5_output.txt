To resolve the precision drop in the `floatformat` filter for `Decimal` numbers, I need to examine the existing implementation of the `floatformat` method within the Django codebase. The analysis indicates the issues stem from the `floatformat` conversion logic, and I've been instructed that it resides within `django/template/defaultfilters.py`.

To proceed, I'll retrieve the source code of the `floatformat` method from the specified file to understand how the conversion is currently being handled and what modifications are necessary to fix the precision issue.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/template/defaultfilters.py", "floatformat")
```

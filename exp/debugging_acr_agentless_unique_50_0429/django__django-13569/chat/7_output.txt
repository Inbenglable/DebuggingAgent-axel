Upon reviewing the provided information:

### Patch Review:
The patch aims to exclude random expressions from the `GROUP BY` clause by modifying the loop that processes `order_by` expressions. The key change is to avoid extending `expressions` with columns from `expr.get_group_by_cols()` if `expr` is an instance of `Random`.

### Test Output Analysis:

**Original Output:**
- The test fails with a `django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady` error indicating that the Django apps are not loaded correctly. This isn't directly linked to the problem described in the issueâ€”it seems an environment setup problem.

**Patched Output:**
- The same `AppRegistryNotReady` error is raised, indicating no change in the particular test behavior concerning the application registry setup. This again suggests a configuration or environment problem rather than a correctness issue with the logic being tested.

### Conclusion:
Regardless of the changes made in the logic for handling `GROUP BY` with `Random` expressions, the issue here seems more related to test setup and configuration rather than the patch's correctness concerning the specified problem. Therefore, based on the provided outputs, we cannot determine if the logic issue is resolved because the environment setup is not correct for testing the original problem.

Issue resolved: `False`

To address the issue with `TemplateView.get_context_data()`, we need to pinpoint the implementation or instances of `get_context_data` that directly reference or methodically propagate `kwargs`. From these, we aim to understand how `SimpleLazyObject` could be affecting the behavior.

The following review highlights which of these results are potentially useful for understanding this issue:

1. **reproduce.py:OfferView.get_context_data**: This implementation is precisely tied to the reproduction of the issue. It's essential as the bug is demonstrated here, and the fix with an explicit type conversion is noted.

2. **django/views/generic/base.py:ContextMixin.get_context_data**: This is a core piece of the implementation since many class-based views utilize `ContextMixin` for context management. Understanding any changes in this will give insight into the transition from Django 3.0 to 3.1.

The other implementations are specific to different views and contexts but may not directly influence SimpleLazyObject concerning our issue. They might use `get_context_data`, but don't contribute to understanding how `SimpleLazyObject` is impacting this specific case.

Given the above analysis, the relevant contexts for further examination are:

```
reproduce.py:OfferView.get_context_data
django/views/generic/base.py:ContextMixin.get_context_data
```

The issue at hand is related to version comparison being done incorrectly as strings rather than as version numbers. As identified in the test scenario, the check fails because '0.10.0' (the actual version) is not recognized as greater than '0.6.0' (the required version) when comparing these as strings.

The test code snippet provided uses a function `check_extension_version` which makes a direct string comparison between `required_version` and `actual_version`. The error arises from these versions being handled as strings, leading to an incorrect comparison result.

Let us proceed to inspect the method responsible for checking extension versions within the actual Sphinx codebase to identify this behavior.

Observed method: `sphinx/application.py:Sphinx.extension_versions`

To address the issue, I need to retrieve the source code for the `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` classes, as well as examine the method that uses `get_current_timezone_name()` within the file `django/db/models/functions/datetime.py`. This will help understand how the `tzinfo` parameter could be supported.

I will also need to consider the `TimeZone` mixin inherited from `TruncBase`, which might affect or override the behavior related to timezone handling. Furthermore, examining how `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` currently handle timezone conversion is necessary. 

Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code of the `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` classes to make the necessary modifications.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncDate")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "TruncTime")
search_code_in_file("django/db/models/functions/datetime.py", "get_current_timezone_name")
```

To resolve the issue, I need to investigate the part of the Django codebase that generates migration files. Specifically, I should locate the code responsible for generating import statements in migration files to ensure they follow the specified order.

I will first search for any modules or functions related to migration file generation. This will help identify where the incorrect import order is being set up. 

Since the task involves Django migrations and they're often handled in a file or module named something like `migration` or `operations`, I'll search for any method related to file generation within the Django framework.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("write_migration_file")
search_method_in_codebase("generate_migration_file")
search_method_in_codebase("MigrationAutodetector.write_migration_file")
search_class_in_codebase("MigrationAutodetector")
```

The issue seems to be related to how Django handles proxy models in combination with `select_related` and `only`. The solution suggests modifying the way Django retrieves metadata for models by accessing the concrete model's metadata.

To resolve this, I need to inspect the code of the `Query` class, specifically around the handling of the model options and how the `select_related` and `only` functions interact with proxy models.

I will search for the file containing the relevant code and locate the necessary method or class responsible for this logic.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Query")
search_method_in_codebase("select_related")
search_method_in_codebase("only")
search_code_in_codebase("cur_model._meta")
```

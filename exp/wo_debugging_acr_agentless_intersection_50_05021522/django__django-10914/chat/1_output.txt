To address this issue, we need to determine where the `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting is being handled in the Django project. It's important to check how Django currently handles file upload permissions within the `FileSystemStorage`. We need to inspect the relevant parts of the Django codebase to make modifications for setting the default file permission to `0o644`.

Let's start by locating the `FileSystemStorage` class in the codebase, as this is where file uploads are typically handled.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("FileSystemStorage")
```

To resolve the issue in the Sphinx project, the bug lies with how the `format_signature` method in the `ClassDocumenter` class formats class signatures with type hints in description mode. The solution involves ensuring that the class signature does not include a return type when the `autodoc_typehints` option is set to "description". We'll modify the `format_signature` method accordingly to strip any return annotation.

Here's the patch in *SEARCH/REPLACE* format to fix the issue:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        sig = super().format_signature()\n=======\n        sig = super().format_signature(show_return_annotation=False)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This change ensures that return annotations are not included when formatting class signatures in description mode, addressing the issue reported.

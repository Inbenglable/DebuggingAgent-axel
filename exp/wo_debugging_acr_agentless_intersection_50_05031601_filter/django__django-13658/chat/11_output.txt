To evaluate whether the issue was resolved by the patch:

1. **Patch Analysis:**
   - The patch changes how the `CommandParser` is instantiated within the `ManagementUtility` class.
   - Originally, the `CommandParser` relied on `sys.argv[0]` for the program name through `%(prog)s`.
   - The patch updates this to explicitly use `self.prog_name` for the `prog` parameter within `CommandParser`.

2. **Test Output Comparison:**
   - **Original Output:** The test throws a `TypeError` because `sys.argv[0]` is set to `None`. This results in an unsuccessful creation of `prog_name` and leads to an `AssertionError` being raised.
   - **Patched Output:** The error and the `AssertionError` are still present. The output is identical to the original output.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the `patched output` is identical to the `original output`, it indicates the patch did not resolve the issue. The test still fails due to the original problem, which means the patch didn't correctly change the behavior to use `self.prog_name`.

Based on this analysis, the issue remains unresolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

The abnormal behavior relates to the interactive mode of the `SpanSelector`, specifically causing the axes limits to expand improperly. The observed snippet within the `SpanSelector.__init__` method highlights a part of the behavior, with the `_setup_edge_handle` method being invoked when `interactive` is set to True. The provided runtime information indicates that `_setup_edge_handle` is called without directly modifying axis limits, suggesting that it initializes edge handles for interactivity without direct axis limit adjustments.

However, since the limits are altered eventually, the manipulation must occur downstream of edge handle setup, potentially in the interactive handling of the tool during or after user interaction. It might be related to how the `ToolLineHandles` or other mechanisms impact axis limits indirectly during interaction.

For further tracing and pinpointing the root cause, the influence of `ToolLineHandles` and associated interactive handling on axis limits should be examined, likely focusing on click, drag, and release event processing within the widget.

Next, I will trace the response to interactive events within the `SpanSelector`:

Observed method: `lib/matplotlib/widgets.py:SpanSelector.onselect`

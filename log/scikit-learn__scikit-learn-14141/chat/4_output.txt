The current issue reported is that `joblib` is not listed in the dependencies output by the `show_versions` function. The relevant method in question appears to be `_get_deps_info` in the `sklearn/utils/_show_versions.py` file. Based on the observable code snippet, `joblib` is currently not included in the list of dependencies:

```python
42   deps = [
43       "pip",
44       "setuptools",
45       "sklearn",
46       "numpy",
47       "scipy",
48       "Cython",
49       "pandas",
50       "matplotlib",
51   ]
```

We need to add `"joblib"` to this list to address the issue. The error related to `dbgsnooper` is unrelated and seems to arise due to an import in a different context that is not affecting the main functionality we need to fix. 

Considering this context, I can identify the buggy method and the necessary code fix.

Buggy method: `sklearn/utils/_show_versions.py:_get_deps_info`

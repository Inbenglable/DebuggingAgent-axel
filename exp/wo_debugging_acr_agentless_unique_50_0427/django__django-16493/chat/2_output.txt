To resolve the issue, I need to inspect the `FileField` class implementation to understand how the `deconstruct` method interacts with other aspects of the class, especially regarding how it manages the `storage` attribute and callable objects. This will help determine the best fix for ensuring that callables returning `default_storage` can be deconstructed correctly.

Thus, I'll proceed to retrieve the implementation of the `FileField` class in the `django/db/models/fields/files.py` file to see its entirety and how it interacts with the `storage` attribute.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/fields/files.py", "FileField")
```

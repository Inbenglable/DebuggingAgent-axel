Based on the analysis of the issue concerning the `caplog` fixture not restoring log levels between tests, the problematic area is centered on the `catching_logs.__exit__` method, specifically where it fails to reset the logging level as intended. The primary focus is on ensuring that `self.orig_level` is used to restore the log level when exiting the context.

To proceed with generating the patch, I need to review the source code of the `catching_logs.__exit__` method. This will ensure understanding of how the logging levels are being managed and identify where the reset mechanism fails.

Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code for the `catching_logs` context manager, particularly its `__exit__` method, to generate a precise patch.

```python
search_method_in_file("src/_pytest/logging.py", "catching_logs.__exit__")
```

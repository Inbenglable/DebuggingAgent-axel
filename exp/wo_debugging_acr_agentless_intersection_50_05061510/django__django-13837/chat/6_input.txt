This is the bug issue, which is in the **django** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Allow autoreloading of `python -m pkg_other_than_django runserver`
Description
	 
		(last modified by William Schwartz)
	 
​django.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments detects if Python was launched as python -m django. Currently it detects only when ​-m was passed specifically django (and only in Python environments in which __file__ is set on modules, which is ​not true of all Python environments). Like #32177, this ticket aims to remove one impediment to creating Django-based command-line utilities that have their own ​__main__ sub-module while overriding Django's built-in management commands—in this case, runserver.
The fix, which I have submitted in the ​attached PR, is to use Python's ​documented way of determining if -m was used in get_child_arguments:
The top-level __main__ module is always the entry point of a ​complete Python program.
 __main__.__spec__ is not None ​if and only if Python was launched with -m or the name of a "directory, zipfile or other sys.path entry." In the latter cases, the ​documentation says
If the script name refers to a directory or zipfile, the script name is added to the start of sys.path and the __main__.py file in that location is executed as the __main__ module.
Hence __main__.__spec__.parent (which is ​usually but not always __main__.__package__) exists and is the empty string when Python is started with the name of a directory or zip file.
Therefore Python was started with -m pkg if and only if __main__.__spec__.parent == "pkg".
Following this algorithm is guaranteed to work as long as Python obeys its own documentation, and has the side benefit of avoiding use of __file__.

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
## REPRODUCE TEST
```
import sys
import traceback
from pathlib import Path
from django.utils.autoreload import get_child_arguments

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Simulate the environment as if the script was run with `python -m pkg_other_than_django runserver`
    sys.argv = ['pkg_other_than_django/__main__.py', 'runserver']
    sys.modules['__main__'].__spec__ = type('ModuleSpec', (object,), {'name': '__main__', 'parent': 'pkg_other_than_django'})()
    
    try:
        args = get_child_arguments()
        # We expect an error here because the current implementation only checks for 'django' in the parent
        # and not for any generic package name.
        assert 'pkg_other_than_django' in args, f"Expected 'pkg_other_than_django' in args, got {args}"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("An unexpected exception occurred") from e
    else:
        print("Issue is fixed. No AssertionError raised.")
        sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

And this is the original output when running the test (before applying the patch):
## ORIGINAL OUTPUT
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-13837/reproduce.py"
    22: args = get_child_arguments()
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-13837/django/utils/autoreload.py"
    243: raise RuntimeError('Script %s does not exist.' % py_script)
RuntimeError: Script pkg_other_than_django/__main__.py does not exist.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-13837/reproduce.py", line 22, in main
    args = get_child_arguments()
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-13837/django/utils/autoreload.py", line 243, in get_child_arguments
    raise RuntimeError('Script %s does not exist.' % py_script)
RuntimeError: Script pkg_other_than_django/__main__.py does not exist.

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-13837/reproduce.py", line 37, in <module>
    main()
  File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-13837/reproduce.py", line 31, in main
    raise AssertionError("An unexpected exception occurred") from e
AssertionError: An unexpected exception occurred

```

The repair agent has tried to generate a patch to fix the issue:
## PATCH CONTEXT
<PATCH_CONTEXT>
To resolve the issue, we need to modify the `get_child_arguments` method in `django/utils/autoreload.py`. Specifically, we should change the logic that evaluates whether Python was launched with the `-m` flag and use the `__main__.__spec__.parent` attribute for determining the name of the package in the Python `-m` invocation.

Here's the patch to achieve this:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/utils/autoreload.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    import django.__main__\n    django_main_path = Path(django.__main__.__file__)\n    py_script = Path(sys.argv[0])\n\n    args = [sys.executable] + ['-W%s' % o for o in sys.warnoptions]\n    if py_script == django_main_path:\n=======\n    import __main__\n\n    args = [sys.executable] + ['-W%s' % o for o in sys.warnoptions]\n    # Determine the running package using __main__.__spec__.parent\n    running_pkg = getattr(__main__.__spec__, 'parent', None)\n    if running_pkg:  # Python was started with -m\n        # Detect if started within a package (usually runserver)\n        args += ['-m', running_pkg]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Import Change**: Changed to `import __main__` since we are relying on Python's `__main__` module to detect the invocation package.
   
2. **Package Detection Logic**: Utilize `__main__.__spec__.parent` as the mechanism for detecting the package the Python script was invoked with, using the `-m` flag.
   
3. **Argument Adjustment**: Based on the detected package, append `['-m', running_pkg]` to reconstruct the child process arguments. 

This ensures that autoreloading can correctly happen when a package other than `django` is used to run the server command.

After applying the patch, the output of the test is:
## PATCHED OUTPUT
```
Issue is fixed. No AssertionError raised.

```

Now, please first review the patch and analyse the test output before and after the patch, to determine whether the issue is fixed or not.

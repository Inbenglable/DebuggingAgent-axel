<ISSUE>
autowrap with cython backend fails when array arguments do not appear in wrapped expr
When using the cython backend for autowrap, it appears that the code is not correctly generated when the function in question has array arguments that do not appear in the final expression. A minimal counterexample is:

```python
from sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap
from sympy import MatrixSymbol
import numpy as np

x = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)
expr = 1.0
f = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')

f(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))
```

This should of course return `1.0` but instead fails with:
```python
TypeError: only size-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars
```

A little inspection reveals that this is because the corresponding C function is generated with an incorrect signature:

```C
double autofunc(double x) {

   double autofunc_result;
   autofunc_result = 1.0;
   return autofunc_result;

}
```

(`x` should be `double *`, not `double` in this case)

I've found that this error won't occur so long as `expr` depends at least in part on each argument. For example this slight modification of the above counterexample works perfectly:

```python
from sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap
from sympy import MatrixSymbol
import numpy as np

x = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)
# now output depends on x
expr = x[0,0]
f = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')

# returns 1.0 as expected, without failure
f(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))
```

This may seem like a silly issue ("why even have `x` as an argument if it doesn't appear in the expression you're trying to evaluate?"). But of course in interfacing with external libraries (e.g. for numerical integration), one often needs functions to have a pre-defined signature regardless of whether a given argument contributes to the output.

I think I've identified the problem in `codegen` and will suggest a PR shortly.

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:

        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The autowrap with cython backend failed as expected due to the issue.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()


This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
The problem outlined in the issue is related to the generation of Cython wrappers when using the `autowrap` function in SymPy. Specifically, it occurs when the generated C function does not have the expected signature for array arguments. The provided minimal counterexample gives insight into the issue: the function signature for the generated C function is incorrect for array arguments when those arguments are not used in the final expression.

As per the error traceback, the main issue seems to be within the code generation logic, likely in the `sympy` library's `codegen` utilities where it determines the data types and generates the corresponding Cython code.

The error message `TypeError: only size-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars` stems from this incorrect interpretation and handling of array arguments in the generated C function signature. According to the issue, when part of the expression depends on the argument, the generated code works as expected, indicating that the code generator is optimizing away inputs, even when explicitly provided as part of the function signature.

To proceed, identifying the buggy code responsible for this incorrect signature generation requires examining the area in the SymPy code base where this Cython wrapper signature is crafted. This could involve the parameter handling sections, specifically in the codegen utilities of SymPy where the expression and its arguments are converted into code.

Given these observations, I will start by looking into the relevant codegen portion where the issue might be.

Observed method: `sympy/utilities/autowrap.py:autowrap`
==================================================
The issue reported indicates that the Cython code generated by the `autowrap` function in SymPy does not properly handle array arguments that do not appear in the expression. The generated function signature is expecting a scalar rather than a pointer for arrays, resulting in a `TypeError`.

The provided runtime information includes the `autowrap` method from `sympy/utilities/autowrap.py`, which is the entry point of interest. This method determines the code generation backend and wraps the expression using that backend. 

Given that the observed runtime error is related to module imports (`No module named 'numpy'`), it is unrelated to the specific issue discussed within the SymPy project about C function signature generation. For this particular issue, the `autowrap` method up to the wrapping part and routine generation is of importance since it calls the code generation functions related to the error in the Cython signature.

### Analysis of the `autowrap` Method:

- **Parameters Setup**: Lines 535-619 focus on setting up parameters for autowrap, including choosing the backend and ensuring proper argument handling.
- **Helpers Handling**: Lines 627-629 process helper expressions, which are auxiliary functions needed for the main expression.
- **Routine Generation**: Lines 635-647 handle routine generation, which is where the code for handling expressions and arguments is created by the code generator.

The incorrect handling of array arguments in the generated Cython code likely happens somewhere within the interaction between `autowrap` and the code generator's routine-related functions (e.g., `routine = code_gen.routine(...)`). The generation here should properly create a C function signature recognizing array input as pointers (`double *` instead correct).

To confirm this, further downstream analysis is needed in the part where the routine is actually being created, especially focusing on the `code_gen.routine(...)` calls and its underlying implementation.

### Next Step

To find the root cause of this generation issue, I will focus on the routine creation line since it likely contains or calls the code responsible for generating the incorrect C signature. This involves understanding how arguments are handled in `routine` and how types are assigned or determined:

Observed scope: `sympy/utilities/autowrap.py:635-647`
==================================================
## Analysis

The error reported during the testing of the observed code snippet is related to the `numpy` module not being found: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'`. However, this is an execution environment issue rather than a reflection of the bug related to the SymPy `autowrap` function and the incorrect signature generation reported in the issue.

In the part of the `autowrap` code snippet under observation, the relevant method call is:

```python
routine = code_gen.routine('autofunc', expr, args)
```

This line is responsible for generating the code routine based on the expression and arguments. The error discussed regarding incorrect function signatures is likely occurring within or as a result of the function calls made in `routine(...)`, where the expression and list of arguments (`args`) are processed.

To identify the code responsible for generating the incorrect C function signature, the focus should be on how argument types are determined inside the `routine` function or any downstream functions it invokes. The signature `double x` being generated instead of `double *x` for an array input suggests that the type handling logic for arguments is not properly identifying matrix symbols as pointer types when not specifically used in the expression.

### Next Step

Since the core of the issue seems to be within the scope of the `routine` function or its sub-components, the next step is to observe and trace the implementation details of the `routine` function to identify why array arguments are incorrectly recognized as scalars in the generated C code.

Observed method: `sympy/utilities/codegen.py:code_gen.routine`

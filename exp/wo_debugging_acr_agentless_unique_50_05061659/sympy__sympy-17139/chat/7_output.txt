To determine whether the issue was fixed, let's first consider the patch applied and examine its logic:

### Patch Analysis:
The patch modifies the comparison logic in `sympy/simplify/fu.py` to check if `rv.exp` is a number before proceeding with comparisons. Specifically:
```python
if rv.exp.is_number and (rv.exp < 0) == True:
    return rv
if rv.exp.is_number and (rv.exp > max) == True:
    return rv
```
This change ensures that comparisons are only performed if `rv.exp` is a numeric type, thereby preventing invalid comparisons with complex numbers such as `I`. The comparison guard here should prevent the `TypeError` related to complex number comparison.

### Test Output Analysis:
Both the original and patched test outputs indicate a `NameError: name 'I' is not defined`. This error stems from the testing code not importing the symbol `I` from `sympy`.

This `NameError` is separate from the originally reported bug. It appears that the test framework didn't correctly execute the unit test due to this missing import. As a result, the main issue related to complex number comparison did not get evaluated after applying the patch.

### Conclusion:
The actual bug fix related to complex number comparisons cannot be verified due to the execution error (`NameError`). To properly verify whether the issue is resolved, the test code should include an import statement for `I`:
```python
from sympy import I
```
Once corrected, the test can be rerun to properly ascertain if the patch fixes the comparison error.

Issue resolved: `False`

Because the NameError prevents verification, the condition must be resolved to test the patch as intended.

To resolve the issue where the `symbols` function doesn't correctly apply the `cls` argument when dealing with tuples of names, I need to modify the `symbols` method to ensure that the `cls` argument is passed correctly during recursive calls. The current implementation doesn't pass the `cls` argument in the recursive call on line 793.

Here's the patch to fix the issue:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/core/symbol.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            result.append(symbols(name, **args))\n=======\n            result.append(symbols(name, cls=cls, **args))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This change will ensure that the `cls` parameter is consistently used when creating symbols, regardless of tuple nesting.

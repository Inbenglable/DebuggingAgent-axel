The provided runtime information reveals that the error occurs during the execution of the `timesince` function in the `django/utils/timesince.py` file. The function call `now - pivot` is causing a `TypeError` because one of the datetime objects is timezone-aware, while the other is timezone-naive. This occurs due to the `pivot` datetime object, which is created without timezone information, as shown by the following line in the traceback:

```python
pivot = datetime.datetime(
    pivot_year,
    pivot_month,
    min(MONTHS_DAYS[pivot_month - 1], d.day),
    d.hour,
    d.minute,
    d.second,
)
```

The absence of `tzinfo` when creating `pivot` turns it into a naive datetime object, which cannot be directly compared to the timezone-aware `datetime` object represented by `now`.

Given this information, I can locate the buggy code in the `timesince` function.

Therefore, the anomaly occurs in this specific method:

Buggy method: `django/utils/timesince.py:timesince`

### Analysis

The Sphinx error you've encountered relates to the processing of function signatures, and the `FunctionDocumenter.format_signature` method plays a key role in formatting method signatures for documentation purposes. The abnormal behavior is how type hints are turned into descriptive documentation which can erroneously include constructor return typesâ€”the root of the issue appears to involve how the `autodoc_typehints = "description"` setting handles type hints and integrates them into generated documentation, especially linked to methods (including `__init__`).

### Observed Runtime Information

The trace shows a version conflict with the `sphinxcontrib.applehelp` extension requires Sphinx v5.0, while the reproduction is running on v4.4.0. This indicates there's a potential mismatch in environmental setup, which could impede accurate tracing of the bug for the earlier version of Sphinx connected with the issue.

### Next Steps

Given the runtime information, the issue might have been resolved in later versions or require additional environmental adjustment. However, we want to continue identifying where class constructor type hints are mishandled. The issue most directly concerns handling type hints for functions and how they're formulated as part of class documentation.

**Decision**: I will proceed with further inspection of any internal logic handling method return type descriptions under `init_documenters`. Specifically focusing on logic related to computing return descriptions from type hints within the environment where anomalies like incorrect class "return type" occur.

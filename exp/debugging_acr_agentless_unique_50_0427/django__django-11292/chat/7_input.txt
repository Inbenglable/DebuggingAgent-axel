## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Add --skip-checks option to management commands.
Description
	
Management commands already have skip_checks stealth option. I propose exposing this option on the command line. This would allow users to skip checks when running a command from the command line. Sometimes in a development environment, it is nice to move ahead with a task at hand rather than getting side tracked fixing a system check.

</ISSUE>


A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
The error message indicates that the `--skip-checks` option is not recognized when calling a management command in Django. This means the option is not correctly implemented or registered in the command parser.

Looking at the traceback, we see the following sequence:

1. `call_command('check', '--skip-checks')` is invoked.
2. Within `django.core.management.__init__.py`, `call_command` creates a parser and attempts to parse arguments.
3. The error originates when calling `parser.parse_args()` within `django.core.management.base.CommandParser`.
4. The unrecognized argument error is raised from within `argparse.py`.

Based on this, we need to investigate how arguments are registered in `create_parser` and whether `--skip-checks` is included in those command-specific argument definitions.

Observed method: `django/core/management/base.py:CommandParser.parse_args`
==================================================
Based on the information provided, we're dealing with a situation where the `--skip-checks` option for Django management commands is not being recognized. The traceback suggests that this unrecognized argument error is being handled by the `CommandParser.parse_args` method in `django/core/management/base.py`.

Let's analyze what's happening:

1. **Execution Flow**: The `call_command('check', '--skip-checks')` attempts to execute a Django management command with the `--skip-checks` option.
2. **Error Origin**: The error arises during the argument parsing process.
3. **Current Observations**: In the `parse_args` method, there's no specific indication that the `--skip-checks` option is being handled or flagged as a valid argument.

Since `parse_args` is a method that extends `argparse`'s functionality, it is likely that the registration of the newly desired `--skip-checks` option should happen earlier in the argument setup process, potentially within the command or parser creation steps.

To further investigate where `--skip-checks` should be recognized as a valid option, we should look into how options are added to the management command framework or individual commands.

### Proposed Next Step
We should deeper observe the code section where arguments for Django management commands are typically defined and registered. This is generally done in the initialization or setup phase of a command, not within the `parse_args` method itself, which is primarily for processing already-defined arguments.

Let's examine the surrounding context in `django/core/management/base.py`:

- **Observed scope**: `django/core/management/base.py:40-49`

By examining this area, we can check how arguments are being set up and determine if this is where the `--skip-checks` option should be implemented.
==================================================
From the information provided, the issue involves integrating a new command-line argument (`--skip-checks`) into Django's management commands. The error indicates the `--skip-checks` argument is not recognized when passed to a management command via the `CommandParser`.

Currently, we have transitioned to observing the initialization phase of `CommandParser` in the snippet from `django/core/management/base.py`:

```python
    45	def __init__(self, *, missing_args_message=None, called_from_command_line=None, **kwargs):
    46	    self.missing_args_message = missing_args_message
    47	    self.called_from_command_line = called_from_command_line
    48	    super().__init__(**kwargs)
```

### Analysis

1. **CommandParser Construction**: The `CommandParser` appears to inherit standard behavior from `argparse.ArgumentParser` through the `super().__init__(**kwargs)` call on line 48.

2. **Custom Argument Handling**: The presence of `missing_args_message` and `called_from_command_line` suggests this class is intended to provide customized error handling or startup logic, potentially initializing specific arguments.

3. **Abnormal Behavior**: The traceback related to `run_debugging_test.py` points to potential issues in an unrelated component (`dbgsnooper`), but does not provide direct insight into argument parsing within Django management commands. However, the error does tell us that `dbgsnooper` is trying but failing to trace through the argument parsing process.

### Next Steps

To further diagnose where the program is lacking in recognizing the `--skip-checks` option, the critical path will involve examining where and how arguments are typically registered or added to `CommandParser`. The initialization we currently observe does not directly manipulate or define command-line arguments beyond calling `super()`, hence it's necessary to investigate the broader lifecycle of command argument setup.

### Proposed Next Step

Investigate where specific command arguments (like `--skip-checks`) are defined and added to `CommandParser`. This will likely be visible in a section where command-specific configurations or additions are done.

Let's move to observe the creation or setup path of command-line arguments in the surrounding infrastructure:

- **Observed Method**: `django/core/management/base.py:BaseCommand.create_parser`

This method or its equivalent in the setup process might be where command options like `--skip-checks` are usually added.
==================================================
Based on the information presented so far, the issue revolves around integrating the `--skip-checks` argument into Django's management command parsing system. We have observed the `BaseCommand.create_parser` method, which constructs the command's argument parser using `CommandParser`. It already registers several command-specific options like `--version`, `--verbosity`, and others.

### Current Analysis
In the `create_parser` method, custom command-line arguments are added using `parser.add_argument`. To introduce the `--skip-checks` option, we should add it within this method to ensure it's recognized during argument parsing.

### Next Steps
Given that the method for adding arguments is clear from the current scope of `create_parser`, the next logical step is to add the `--skip-checks` argument in this method.

#### Proposed Action
To solve the issue, extend the `create_parser` method by adding an argument for `--skip-checks` using `parser.add_argument`.

Therefore, the buggy method where the modification should be made is:

Buggy method: `django/core/management/base.py:BaseCommand.create_parser`
==================================================


Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

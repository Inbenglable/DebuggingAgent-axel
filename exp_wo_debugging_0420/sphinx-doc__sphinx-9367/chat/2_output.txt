To address the issue of the 1-element tuple being incorrectly rendered, I need to locate and modify the part of the code responsible for rendering or formatting tuples. This involves understanding how tuples are handled in Sphinx.

First, I will need to identify the method or module in the Sphinx project that deals with rendering or formatting tuples in the context of the reported issue. Let's search for the relevant code where the handling of tuples, especially handling commas or formatting, might be taking place. 

Given the context that this bug is related to a previously addressed issue (#7964), and its resolution (#8265), we might need to look into these references if they provide any clue about where the tuple formatting occurs. However, since the issue provides a test path, it suggests the area where the behavior can be noticed or tested. Let's start by looking at the test path provided to understand the area of effect.

Since there's a hint to add a test case related to this specific issue at a certain file path, I need to look into how this test is implemented, which might lead us to the rendering logic.

```python
search_code_in_file("tests/test_pycode_ast.py", "def test")
```

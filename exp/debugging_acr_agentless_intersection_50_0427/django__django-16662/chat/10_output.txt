To address the issue of the import order in the migration files, we need to focus on the `MigrationWriter.as_string` method. I have already obtained the source code for this method. The method "as_string" currently sorts imports in a manner that places all imports together and sorts them alphabetically, but it does not respect the convention of placing `import` statements before `from ... import ...` statements within each section. 

Therefore, I am ready to generate the patch to modify the import ordering logic in the `as_string` method. 

Ready generation: `True`

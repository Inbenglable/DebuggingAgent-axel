To address the issue of `ds.Coarsen.construct` demoting non-dimensional coordinates to variables, we need to focus on the implementation of the `coarsen` method in relation to datasets and how it handles the construction process. Let's analyze the API returned content:

1. **xarray/core/variable.py:Variable.coarsen**  
   This method applies a reduction function to the data. It deals with the variable-level coarsening but does not directly relate to how datasets handle coordinates during the coarsening process.

2. **xarray/core/dataset.py:Dataset.coarsen**  
   This is crucial because the issue occurs within a dataset context. This method sets up the `DatasetCoarsen`, which handles coarsening for datasets including the coordinate functions. This seems directly related to the investigation.

3. **xarray/core/dataarray.py:DataArray.coarsen**  
   This method deals with coarsening for DataArrays. While helpful for understanding the overall coarsening context, it's likely less relevant since the issue specifically pertains to datasets (`ds`).

Given the focus on dataset-level issues regarding coordinates, the most relevant content is:

```
xarray/core/dataset.py:Dataset.coarsen
```

To resolve this issue, I need to identify where the version comparison is handled in the Sphinx project codebase, specifically in the part that deals with `needs_extensions`. The goal is to replace the string-based comparison with proper version comparison using a more robust method, such as `packaging.version.parse`.

For this, I will need to locate the `needs_extensions` method (or function, if it's written that way) and inspect how it's currently handling the version comparison. 

Let's start by searching for the `needs_extensions` to find where its definition is within the Sphinx project.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("needs_extensions")
```

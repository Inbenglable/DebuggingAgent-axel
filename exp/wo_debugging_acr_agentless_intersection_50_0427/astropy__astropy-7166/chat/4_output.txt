To address the issue with the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass not handling properties, we will update the `__init__` method to check for both functions and properties. This involves examining the attributes using `inspect.isfunction` and `inspect.isdatadescriptor`, which can check for properties. Let's construct a patch for this change.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### astropy/utils/misc.py:InheritDocstrings.__init__\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            if (inspect.isfunction(val) and\n=======\n            if ((inspect.isfunction(val) or isinstance(val, property)) and\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
``` 

This patch modifies the condition to detect properties by adding a check for whether the value `val` is a property using `isinstance(val, property)`. Thus, it enables the metaclass to process properties similarly to functions when inheriting docstrings.

To resolve the issue with the `captured_output` function being used incorrectly, we need to modify the `handle` method in `reproduce.py` to capture the `stdout` and `stderr` streams separately. Below is the patch to be applied to fix this problem:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### reproduce.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        # Capture the output of the migrate command\n        with captured_output('stdout', 'stderr') as (out, err):\n=======\n        # Capture the output of the migrate command separately for stdout and stderr\n        with captured_output('stdout') as out, captured_output('stderr') as err:\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch modifies the `handle` method to use two separate `with` statements, correctly aligning with the expected usage of the `captured_output` function.

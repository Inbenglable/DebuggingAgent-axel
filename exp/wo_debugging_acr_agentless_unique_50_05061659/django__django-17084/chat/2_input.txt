## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Cannot use aggregate over window functions since 4.2
Description
	 
		(last modified by younes-chaoui)
	 
After upgrading to Django 4.2, I encountered an exception when executing ORM queries that involve aggregates over Window functions. The specific error was psycopg2.errors.GroupingError: aggregate function calls cannot contain window function calls
Dependencies :
psycopg2 version: 2.9.3
django version: 4.2.3
PostgreSQL version: 13.4
Example Code:
queryset = queryset.annotate(
	cumul_DJR=Coalesce(Window(Sum("DJR"), order_by=F("date").asc()), 0.0)
)
aggregate = queryset.aggregate(
	DJR_total=Sum("DJR"),
	cumul_DJR_total=Sum("cumul_DJR")
)

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
The issue occurs due to the attempt to use aggregate functions on the result of window functions in Django 4.2, which is not supported by PostgreSQL. The error message suggests that PostgreSQL does not allow an aggregate function to encapsulate a window function directly.

To resolve this issue, we must modify the code to handle the aggregation in a way that PostgreSQL supports. This might involve restructuring the query or using subqueries to handle these operations separately.

Before generating the patch, we should gain insights into the usage patterns and behavior of Django's ORM when dealing with Window expressions and aggregation. This will involve checking for related source code in Django's ORM or Query library. Let's search for the presence of relevant classes and methods used in these operations in the Django codebase. This will help in understanding how Window functions and aggregates are managed.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Window")
search_class_in_codebase("Sum")
```

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

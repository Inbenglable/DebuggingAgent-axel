After reviewing the API invocation results, it seems that the methods `check` from `tests/test_domain_c.py` and `tests/test_domain_cpp.py` are related to domain-specific test functionalities, particularly in testing the C and C++ domains respectively. These methods are designed for checking specific semantic properties or outputs related to C/C++ documentation rather than the general link-checking functionality within the Sphinx project. 

The nature of the issue suggests that the problem lies within the link-checking mechanism of Sphinx itself, specifically how it handles HTTP status codes and anchor checking. The search results describe methods that are seemingly disconnected from the aforementioned functionality since they are not interacting with HTTP or links in any documented capacity. 

Therefore, the methods listed in these files are not required for resolving the bug issue regarding the link-check behavior:

No needed content as returned by your search, none of the provided snippets match our criteria for the link-checking mechanism.

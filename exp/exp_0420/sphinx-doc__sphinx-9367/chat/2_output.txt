Based on the issue description and the test output, the `unparse` function in the `sphinx.pycode.ast` module does not properly handle single-element tuples.

In a single-element tuple, it's crucial to retain the trailing comma to differentiate it from simple parentheses. The test case demonstrates that the input `(1,)` is incorrectly being unparsed to just `(1)`, losing this critical comma, which is resulting in the mismatch between expected and actual output.

This issue is most likely rooted in the logic of the `unparse` function or a related helper class or function like `_UnparseVisitor` that traverses the AST and reconstructs the source code.

Since the unparse operation calls `_UnparseVisitor.visit` with the node, the culprit might lie in `_UnparseVisitor`, which should properly handle unparsing the Tuple node, specifically with regard to maintaining the trailing comma for single-element tuples.

Next, I will trace the `_UnparseVisitor` method where likely the single-element tuple handling is implemented.

Observed method: `sphinx/pycode/ast.py:_UnparseVisitor.visit`

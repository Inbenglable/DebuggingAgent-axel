To proceed with generating a patch, I need to locate the method in which the specific code snippet (`opts = cur_model._meta`) resides to understand its context better. This will allow me to confidently apply the necessary modification. So, I will start by searching for the method in the file `django/db/models/sql/query.py` that contains this code around line 745.

```python
search_code_in_file("django/db/models/sql/query.py", "opts = cur_model._meta")
```

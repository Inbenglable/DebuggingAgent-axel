Upon reviewing the provided patch and test outputs, the following points can be noted:

1. **Patch Content**:
   - The proposed patch attempts to modify the logic for setting visibility of shared axes in the `cla` method. The intention is to ensure only the primary shared axis retains visibility for ticks and labels, while secondary axes within the shared group do not display them.
   - The patch modifies conditionals in `cla` to check if the current axis (`self`) is the primary one among shared axes using `get_siblings`. 

2. **Patch Errors**:
   - The error message in the patched output indicates a `TypeError`: `get_siblings() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given`. This suggests that the patch introduces an incorrect call to the `get_siblings` method, which is already causing a failure during test execution.
   - The patch alters the method signature of `get_siblings`, leading to the function being called with inappropriate arguments.

3. **Test Output Before the Patch**:
   - The test does not show any specific output related to the bug before applying the patch, particularly as no debugging lines are explicitly mentioned.

4. **Test Output After the Patch**:
   - The test fails to run due to the `TypeError` introduced by the patch. This indicates that the patch does not correctly address the issue of clearing axes with shared ticks.

Given the error introduced by the patch and the absence of any salient improvements in test output, it is clear that the issue is not resolved with the proposed changes.

Issue resolved: `False`

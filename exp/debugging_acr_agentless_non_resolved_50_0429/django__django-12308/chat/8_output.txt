To resolve the issue with `JSONField` displaying as dict when readonly in the Django admin, I need to look at the `prepare_value` method in the `django/db/models/fields/json.py` file, as it involves handling JSON serialization. This will help me understand how JSON values are prepared by the field.

### Next Steps
I need to retrieve the source code for the `prepare_value` method from the `django/db/models/fields/json.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/fields/json.py", "prepare_value")
```

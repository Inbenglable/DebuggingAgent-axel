To resolve the issue, we need to modify the condition in the `add_fields` method within the `django/forms/formsets.py` file. Specifically, we need to ensure that the comparison `index < initial_form_count` is only evaluated if `index` is not `None`. Here are the required changes in a patch format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/forms/formsets.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or index < initial_form_count):\n=======\n        if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or (index is not None and index < initial_form_count)):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch checks whether `index is not None` before performing the comparison with `initial_form_count`, which should prevent the `TypeError` from being raised.

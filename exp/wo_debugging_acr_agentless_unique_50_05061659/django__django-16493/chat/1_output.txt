To address the issue, we need to modify the `deconstruct` method of the `FileField` class in Django's codebase. The task at hand involves ensuring that a callable passed to the `storage` argument is correctly included in the deconstructed form, even if it evaluates to `default_storage`.

First, we need to review the source code of the `deconstruct` method within the `FileField` class. I'll proceed to retrieve this method to generate the necessary patch.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("FileField.deconstruct")
```

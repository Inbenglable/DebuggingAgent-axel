To resolve the issue described, I need to review the source code of both the `FileInput.use_required_attribute` and `ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute` methods.

Additionally, I should examine the `ClearableFileInput` class to understand its context and relationship with `FileInput`. Ensuring `required` attribute logic is correctly handled when initial data exists will require accessing and modifying these methods.

Thus, I will need to retrieve the source code of the mentioned class and methods.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "FileInput.use_required_attribute")
search_method_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute")
search_class_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "ClearableFileInput")
```

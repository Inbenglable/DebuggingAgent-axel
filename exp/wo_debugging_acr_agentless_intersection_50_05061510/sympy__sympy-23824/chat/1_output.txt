To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code for the `kahane_simplify` method to understand how the leading gamma matrices are manipulated and how to address the bug. Since the file path is not provided, I will search for the method in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("kahane_simplify")
```

To address the issue of adding nullable `OneToOneField` in SQLite, the primary focus should be on how Django handles SQL commands for altering tables while considering SQLite's constraints. Therefore, we should examine contexts where SQLite-specific schema changes are carried out.

Here is the analysis of the API returned content:

1. `tests/backends/oracle/test_operations.py:131-137` - This relates to Oracle-specific schema operations and is irrelevant for SQLite.

2. `tests/schema/tests.py:283-289` - This involves testing deferred SQL, which might have some relevance but doesn't specifically focus on SQLite.

3. `django/db/backends/base/schema.py:941-947` - Provides a general overview of handling ALTER TABLE SQL fragments; might be useful context.

4. `django/db/backends/base/features.py:165-171` - Discusses broader database features but not SQLite specifically.

5. `django/db/backends/oracle/schema.py:190-196` - Oracle-specific, not relevant to SQLite.

6. `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py:353-359` - Specific to altering fields in SQLite, directly relates to handling schema changes in SQLite.

7. `django/db/backends/sqlite3/features.py:26-32` - Discusses SQLiteâ€™s specific capabilities, particularly around table renaming, indicating inherent database capabilities that may matter.

8. `django/db/backends/postgresql/schema.py:31-37` - PostgreSQL-specific information, not relevant.

9. `django/db/backends/mysql/schema.py:47-53` - MySQL-specific, not relevant to the problem with SQLite.

10. `django/db/backends/mysql/operations.py:198-204` - MySQL operations, not pertinent for SQLite.

11. `django/contrib/postgres/operations.py:306-312` - PostgreSQL operations, not applicable to SQLite.

12. `django/contrib/postgres/constraints.py:122-128` - PostgreSQL constraints, not relevant to the SQLite issue.

Based on the analysis, we need to focus specifically on contents dealing with SQLite schema operations and features.

Chosen relevant contents:
```
django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py:353-359
django/db/backends/sqlite3/features.py:26-32
```

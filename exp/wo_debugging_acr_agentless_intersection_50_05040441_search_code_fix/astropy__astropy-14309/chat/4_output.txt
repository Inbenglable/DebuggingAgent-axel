To determine whether the issue is resolved, let's review the patch and the test outputs before and after applying the patch.

### Patch Review
The patch modifies the `is_fits` function within `astropy/io/fits/connect.py`. The original line was:

```python
return isinstance(args[0], (HDUList, TableHDU, BinTableHDU, GroupsHDU))
```

This line caused an `IndexError` when `args` was an empty tuple because it attempted to access `args[0]`. The patch introduced the following change:

```python
return args and isinstance(args[0], (HDUList, TableHDU, BinTableHDU, GroupsHDU))
```

This modification adds a check to ensure that `args` is non-empty before accessing its first element. This change prevents the `IndexError` from occurring when `args` is empty. The logic is sound and addresses the cause of the error described in the issue.

### Test Outputs Review
#### Original Output
Before the patch, the test execution resulted in an `IndexError`:

```plaintext
IndexError: tuple index out of range
```

This aligns with the issue description, as the error occurred due to an attempt to access an element of an empty tuple.

#### Patched Output
After applying the patch, there is no output, indicating that no exception was raised during the test execution. The absence of error messages or stack traces implies that the patched code successfully handled the input without producing an IndexError. This suggests the issue was appropriately addressed.

### Conclusion
The patch effectively resolves the problem by ensuring that the `args` tuple is checked for content before attempting to index it. The absence of errors in the patched output confirms that the fix has removed the previously existing `IndexError`.

Therefore, the issue is resolved:

Issue resolved: `True`

## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Merging dataArray into dataset using dataset method fails
While it's possible to merge a dataset and a dataarray object using the top-level `merge()` function, if you try the same thing with the `ds.merge()` method it fails.

```python
import xarray as xr

ds = xr.Dataset({'a': 0})
da = xr.DataArray(1, name='b')

expected = xr.merge([ds, da])  # works fine
print(expected)

ds.merge(da)  # fails
```

Output:
```
<xarray.Dataset>
Dimensions:  ()
Data variables:
    a        int64 0
    b        int64 1

Traceback (most recent call last):

    actual = ds.merge(da)

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
## REPRODUCE TEST
```
import xarray as xr
import traceback
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    ds = xr.Dataset({'a': 0})
    da = xr.DataArray(1, name='b')

    expected = xr.merge([ds, da])  # works fine
    print(expected)

    try:
        actual = ds.merge(da)  # fails
        assert actual.equals(expected), "The merged dataset does not match the expected result."
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The ds.merge(da) method failed as expected, indicating the issue is present.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

And this is the original output when running the test (before applying the patch):

The repair agent has tried to generate a patch to fix the issue:
## PATCH CONTEXT
<PATCH_CONTEXT>
To resolve the issue where merging a `DataArray` into a `Dataset` using the `Dataset.merge()` method fails, we need to modify the method so it can handle `DataArray` inputs appropriately. The error stems from assuming that `other` is always a mapping (like a `Dataset`), which is not the case for `DataArray`.

We can modify the `dataset_merge_method` to ensure it converts a `DataArray` to a suitable mapping before proceeding.

Here are the necessary code changes:

```pythony
### xarray/core/merge.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    if isinstance(overwrite_vars, Iterable) and not isinstance(overwrite_vars, str):
=======
    from .dataarray import DataArray  # Import DataArray at the beginning of the file if not already imported

    if isinstance(other, DataArray):
        other = other._to_temp_dataset()  # Convert DataArray to Dataset

    if isinstance(overwrite_vars, Iterable) and not isinstance(overwrite_vars, str):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that if a `DataArray` is passed to `dataset_merge_method`, it will first be converted to a `Dataset` before proceeding with the merge.

Here is the JSON response with the edit:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### xarray/core/merge.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    if isinstance(overwrite_vars, Iterable) and not isinstance(overwrite_vars, str):\n=======\n    from .dataarray import DataArray  # Import DataArray at the beginning of the file if not already imported\n\n    if isinstance(other, DataArray):\n        other = other._to_temp_dataset()  # Convert DataArray to Dataset\n\n    if isinstance(overwrite_vars, Iterable) and not isinstance(overwrite_vars, str):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```
</PATCH_CONTEXT>

After applying the patch, the output of the test is:
## PATCHED OUTPUT

The issue appears to be related to the `_image()` function within the `homomorphisms.py` file of the sympy codebase. In order to address this issue and generate a patch, it would be necessary to examine the source code of the `_image()` function.

Therefore, I will proceed with retrieving the source code for the `_image()` function from the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py", "_image")
```

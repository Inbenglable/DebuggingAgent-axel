The `subfigures` method is already retrieved. However, to fully resolve the issue, it's essential to verify how `GridSpec` manages `wspace` and `hspace` since these parameters are passed to it in the `subfigures` method. Therefore, I need to review the implementation of `GridSpec` to understand how it handles these parameters.

Let's retrieve the code for the `GridSpec` class to investigate its implementation.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("GridSpec")
```

To determine which piece of code is needed to resolve the issue with `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension`, I will analyze the API results:

1. **sympy/physics/units/quantities.py:Quantity._collect_factor_and_dimension**:
   - This method is deprecated and suggests using a method from the `UnitSystem` class instead. It acts as a redirection to the new method in `UnitSystem`.
   - This content does not contain the actual logic needed since it is simply a deprecation notice and redirect.

2. **sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py:UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension**:
   - This method contains the logic for the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method within the `UnitSystem` class.
   - It includes detailed logic for handling different types of expressions (e.g., `Quantity`, `Mul`, `Pow`, `Add`, etc.), which is relevant for understanding how expressions are processed.
   - This content is necessary to solve the issue because it is the current implementation referenced in the issue and contains the logic for manipulating expressions and dimensions.

Given this analysis, only the `UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension` method is needed to analyze and fix the bug.

Based on the above analysis, the chosen necessary content is:

```
sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py:UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension
```

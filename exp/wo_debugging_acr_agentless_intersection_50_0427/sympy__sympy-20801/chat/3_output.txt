To resolve this issue, I need to review the implementation of the sympy.core.numbers class, particularly the __eq__ method, which will handle the equality comparison between `S.false` and the floating-point `0.0`. Additionally, I must verify the handling of float comparisons in these classes to ensure that modifying comparisons won't break other functionalities.

I'll search for the class and method definitions in the `sympy/core/numbers.py` file, where numeric-related classes and methods are typically implemented.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("sympy.core.numbers.BooleanFalse")
search_method_in_codebase("sympy.core.numbers.BooleanFalse.__eq__")
search_method_in_codebase("sympy.core.numbers.Float.__eq__")
```

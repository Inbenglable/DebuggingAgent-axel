To resolve the issue where `merge(combine_attrs='override')` does not copy attributes correctly, we need to change the code so that it returns a copy of the attributes dictionary instead of a reference to the first object's attributes. Here is the required change in the `merge.py` file:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### xarray/core/merge.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        return variable_attrs[0]\n=======\n        return dict(variable_attrs[0])\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This modification ensures that the returned attributes are a new dictionary, thereby preventing any unintentional modifications to the original attributes of the first dataset.

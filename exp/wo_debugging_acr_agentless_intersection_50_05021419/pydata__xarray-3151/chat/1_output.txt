To address the issue with `xr.combine_by_coords`, I first need to locate and analyze the implementation of `combine_by_coords`. This will help determine how the code currently handles the monotonicity checks. Since I don't know the file path where `combine_by_coords` is implemented, I will search for this method in the xarray codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("combine_by_coords")
```

Based on the retrieved code, the issue arises from attempting a division in the calculation of `dual_coef_indptr` when `support_vectors_` is empty. To address this, we need to introduce a check for the size of `support_vectors_` and avoid the division if it's zero. Additionally, we should ensure that `dual_coef_` is correctly initialized to an empty sparse matrix when `support_vectors_` is empty.

The retrieved code for `_sparse_fit` seems sufficient to perform this modification. Therefore, I am ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

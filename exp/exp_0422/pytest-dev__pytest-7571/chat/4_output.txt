From the provided code snippet and tracing information, we can gain insights into the `LogCaptureFixture` class, specifically focusing on the `_finalize` method, which, according to the docstring, is intended to restore log levels modified by the `set_level` method. 

The `_finalize` method iterates over a dictionary (`self._initial_logger_levels`) that stores the initial log levels for loggers by name and attempts to reset the loggers to these initial levels. This suggests that there is a mechanism already in place to restore log levels, but it seems not to be functioning as expected.

Given the design of the code, we need to examine:

1. How and when `_finalize` is being called in the test lifecycle.
2. Whether `self._initial_logger_levels` is being correctly populated during the setup of the fixture.
3. If the method is being invoked at the correct time to restore the levels after each test.

As the trace did not provide enough specific information about why `_finalize` isn't operating correctly, and we need more information about its lifecycle integration. Hence, the next step would be to trace further into the method that might be responsible for initializing or invoking `_finalize`.

Observed method: `src/_pytest/logging.py:LogCaptureFixture.__init__`

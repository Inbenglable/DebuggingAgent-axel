To resolve the issue, I need to modify the implementation of the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass to correctly handle properties in addition to functions. Therefore, I need to inspect how properties are defined and potentially override their docstrings, similar to the functions. For this, I am ready to generate the patch, as I already have the current implementation of the `__init__` method of `InheritDocstrings`.

Ready generation: `True`

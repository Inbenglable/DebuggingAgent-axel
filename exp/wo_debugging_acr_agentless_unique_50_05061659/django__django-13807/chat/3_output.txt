To resolve the issue, I need to examine the source code of the `check_constraints` method in the `base.py` file located under the `django/db/backends/sqlite3` directory. This is necessary to understand its implementation and make the appropriate changes to fix the bug. 

Let's proceed to search for the `check_constraints` method in the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py", "check_constraints")
```

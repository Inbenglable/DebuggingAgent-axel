To determine whether the issue has been fixed, let's analyze the key details of the patch and the test outputs:

### Patch Review
The patch made the following changes:
- Commented out the condition that checks for duplicate elements.
- Commented out the `ValueError` that is raised when duplicates are found.

The goal of this patch was to allow `Permutation` to handle non-disjoint cycles by not raising an error when duplicates are found, under the assumption that these should be applied in left-to-right order to produce an identity permutation.

### Test Output Analysis

**Original Output:**
- The test failed because the `Permutation` constructor raised a `ValueError` due to repeated elements in cycle notation, as expected based on the issue description.

**Patched Output:**
- A syntax issue occurred, specifically an `IndentationError`, preventing successful execution.
- This indicates the patch introduced a formatting problem in the code (likely due to incorrect commenting affecting the indentation structure).

### Conclusion
Due to the syntax error in the patched output, the code cannot be executed to accurately determine whether the functional issue is resolved. The introduced `IndentationError` needs to be fixed before the functional correctness of handling non-disjoint cycles can be validated.

**Issue resolved: `False`**

The issue relates to an `IndexError` occurring in the `is_fits` function located in the `connect.py` file, specifically affecting the `identify_format` function when it attempts `isinstance(args[0], ...)`. This error suggests that `args` does not contain the expected element.

To create a patch, I need to retrieve the code for the `is_fits` function and understand its logic, ensuring it properly checks for `args` before accessing `args[0]`.

I'll start by searching for the `is_fits` function in the relevant file.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/io/fits/connect.py", "is_fits")
```

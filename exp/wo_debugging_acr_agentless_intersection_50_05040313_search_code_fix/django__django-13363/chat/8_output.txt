To determine if the issue is resolved, let's analyze the patch and the test outputs before and after applying the patch:

1. **Patch Content:**
   - The patch aims to alter the way the `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` functions handle the `tzinfo` parameter by making them respect the user-supplied `tzinfo` instead of always using the current timezone.
   - This is supposed to make the functions work as expected for different `tzinfo` parameters.

2. **Original Output:**
   - The test failed with an `OperationalError`, indicating "no such table: __main___timeslots". This error suggests that the database table required for the `TimeSlots` model was not created.

3. **Patched Output:**
   - The output after applying the patch is identical to the original output. The same `OperationalError` is present, indicating that "no such table: __main___timeslots". This means the test was unable to proceed past database setup and creation of the test data.

**Conclusion:**
- The issue with the table not being created is preventing the evaluation of whether the patch fixes the `tzinfo` behavior for `TruncDate` and `TruncTime`.
- Without successful setup and execution of the test, we cannot determine whether the patch actually resolves the intended issue.
  
Given that the underlying problem with the database setup still exists, the provided test results do not indicate whether the issue described in the bug report is resolved. Therefore, additional debugging is needed to address the database table creation issue before properly testing the patch for the timezone handling behavior.

Issue resolved: `False`

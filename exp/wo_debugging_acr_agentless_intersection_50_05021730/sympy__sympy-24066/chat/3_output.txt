The source code for the method `UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension` has been retrieved. Reviewing the code indicates that the issue arises in the handling of `Function` type expressions within the method, which doesn't properly account for dimensionless cases. To resolve the issue, we need to correctly handle dimensionless results in the case of `Function` types.

I'm ready to generate the patch after reviewing the current method's source code.

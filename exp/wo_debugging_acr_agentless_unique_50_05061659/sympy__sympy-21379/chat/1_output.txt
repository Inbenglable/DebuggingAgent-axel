The issue appears to be related to how `subs()` is handling the expression involving hyperbolic functions, piecewise, and division when assumptions are applied. The error message indicates a problem with `PolynomialError`, specifically with Piecewise generators. The problem disappears under various conditions affecting the structure and assumptions of the expression components.

To resolve this issue, we need to analyze the source code related to `Piecewise`, `PolynomialError`, and subs() in sympy to identify why this specific combination is leading to an error. This will likely involve understanding the implementation of piecewise expression substitution and how assumptions affect this.

Since subs() is a commonly used method in sympy, and the error message directly mentions `PolynomialError` and `Piecewise`, I will start by retrieving the source code related to these components.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("subs")
search_class_in_codebase("PolynomialError")
search_class_in_codebase("Piecewise")
```

The current analysis indicates the problem originates from the regular expression pattern used in the `ASCIIUsernameValidator` inside the `django/contrib/auth/validators.py` file. The regex pattern used, `r'^[\w.@+-]+$'`, allows for matching usernames ending with a newline, which is not the intended behavior. This happens because the `$` anchor in the regex can match a trailing newline character in Python, allowing invalid usernames to pass through the validator.

The abnormal behavior observed is that the validator doesn't raise an error for usernames that end with a newline, contrary to expectations. Therefore, the correction involves changing the regex pattern to correctly reject such usernames. The correct pattern should use `\A` and `\Z` to constrict the match strictly to the start and end of the string, rejecting any trailing newline characters.

Given this explanation and the behavior observed, we can locate the buggy method as follows:

To address the issue, we need to ensure that the `cls` parameter is being correctly passed along during the recursive call in the `symbols` function when tuples or lists of names are provided. Here is the patch in the SEARCH/REPLACE format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/core/symbol.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            result.append(symbols(name, **args))\n=======\n            result.append(symbols(name, cls=cls, **args))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This change ensures that the `cls` parameter is consistently applied, even for nested sequences of names, thereby preserving the intended behavior of creating objects of the specified class.

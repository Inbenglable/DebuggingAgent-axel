The issue is that during the reinsertion of leading gamma matrices in the `kahane_simplify` function, the insertion loop processes these matrices in reverse order. In order to fix this, I have reviewed the source code of the `kahane_simplify` method provided above. 

The fix involves adjusting the loop that prepends the leading uncontracted gamma matrices so that it maintains their original order instead of reversing them.

Given that I have the required information and code source, I am ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

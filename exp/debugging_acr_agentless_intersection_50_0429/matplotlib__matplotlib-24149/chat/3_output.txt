To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code for the `_safe_first_finite` method in the `cbook` module of Matplotlib to understand how it currently handles non-finite input values. This will allow me to generate the appropriate patch to fix the bug.

```python
search_method_in_file("lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py", "_safe_first_finite")
```

## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Drop support for SQLite < 3.9.0
Description
	 
		(last modified by Tim Graham)
	 
Indexes on expressions (see #26167) and the SQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1 compile-time option are supported on â€‹SQLite 3.9.0+.
Ubuntu Xenial ships with SQLite 3.11.0 (which will still by supported by Django) and will EOL in April 2021. Debian Jessie ships with 3.8.7 and was EOL June 30, 2020.
SQLite 3.9.0 was released in October 2015. SQLite version support seems like a similar situation as GEOS libraries which we generally support about 5 years after released.

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To address the issue of dropping support for SQLite versions lower than 3.9.0 in the Django project, we need to identify the parts of the codebase where the SQLite version is checked or enforced. This often involves examining the database-backend code where connection settings are managed. We may also need to update documentation or error messages related to the supported SQLite versions.

First, I need to gather the source code involved in checking the SQLite version or configuration settings in Django. To achieve this, I'll begin by searching for relevant methods or classes related to the SQLite backend:

```python
search_class_in_codebase("DatabaseWrapper")
search_method_in_codebase("check_sqlite_version")
search_code_in_codebase("sqlite_version")
```

These searches will help identify where the SQLite version is checked or enforced within the Django codebase, as well as any related configuration settings or version checks. With this, I'll be equipped to modify the code to drop support for SQLite versions lower than 3.9.0.

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

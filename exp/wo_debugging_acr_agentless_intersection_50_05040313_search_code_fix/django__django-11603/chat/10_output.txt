Upon reviewing the provided context, the test outputs, and the patch, the following observations can be made:

1. **Issue Description**: The issue involves adding DISTINCT support to the `Avg`, `Sum`, `Min`, and `Max` aggregate classes in Django.

2. **Reproducible Test**: The test is designed to run queries using these aggregates with a DISTINCT parameter and expects to catch exceptions if DISTINCT is not supported.

3. **Original Test Output**: Both before and after the patch, the test failed with the error: `django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet.` This indicates that the issue lies with how the Django test environment is initialized, not with the functionality of the DISTINCT support itself.

4. **Patch Context**: The patch suggests changes to `django/db/models/aggregates.py`, adding `allow_distinct = True` to the classes `Avg`, `Sum`, `Min`, and `Max`. These changes are necessary to implement DISTINCT support.

5. **Patched Test Output**: The output after applying the patch is the same as the original output, indicating the error persists. This suggests the patch did not address the initialization error in the test setup.

6. **Diagnosis**: The problem seems to lie in how the Django setup is performed in the test case, specifically the configuration of the `INSTALLED_APPS`. The current configuration does not include the module under test as part of the `INSTALLED_APPS`, which is likely causing the `AppRegistryNotReady` error.

**Conclusion**: The patch adds the necessary support for DISTINCT as per the issue's requirement, but the persistent test error is unrelated to the patch and needs to be resolved separately for correct testing. Therefore, while the patch itself might be correct and issue-resolution-related, it cannot be conclusively verified due to the flawed test setup.

Issue resolved: `False`

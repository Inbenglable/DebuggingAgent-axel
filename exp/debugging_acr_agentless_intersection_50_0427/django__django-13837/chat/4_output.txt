The source code for the `get_child_arguments` method in `django/utils/autoreload.py` has been obtained. The issue relates to handling execution of modules other than Django using the `-m` option. The existing logic caters specifically to the `django` package, whereas it should accommodate other packages as well.

Since I've examined the current logic and the required change involves updating how modules are detected and arguments are set based on the new detection method `__main__.__spec__.parent`, I'm ready to craft the fix without needing additional code.

Ready generation: `True`

Analyzing the provided code and error message, the issue stems from attempting to import `AddIndex` from the non-existent module `django.db.migrations.operations.indexes`. The error message clearly states that there is no module named 'django.db.migrations.operations.indexes'.

The observed program behavior is an ImportError due to a module that does not exist in Django's migration operation hierarchy. We need to resolve the issue by identifying the correct location or structure of the import.

Here's the approach to resolve the issue:
1. Verify the correct Django version is being used.
2. Locate the correct module or path to import `AddIndex`.

Given the nature of ImportErrors typically resulting from incorrect paths, it is likely the buggy code is in the imports at the start of the script:

Buggy method: `reproduce.py:<module>`

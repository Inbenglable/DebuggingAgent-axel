To address the issue, we will modify the `trim_docstring` function in the `django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py` file as suggested by skipping the first line of the docstring when calculating the indentation. The change will ensure that the indentation is calculated correctly even when the docstring starts on the first line.

Here are the patches in `SEARCH/REPLACE` format:

```pythony
### django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())
=======
    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, I'll provide this edit in JSON format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())\n=======\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

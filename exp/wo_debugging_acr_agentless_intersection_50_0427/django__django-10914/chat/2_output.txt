To address the issue of setting the default `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` to `0o644`, we need to make sure that the `FileSystemStorage` class correctly handles the permissions if not explicitly provided by the user. The permissions should be set consistently regardless of the temporary upload method used (`MemoryUploadedFile` or `TemporaryUploadedFile`).

To proceed, I need to inspect the `_save` method of the `FileSystemStorage` class, as it is likely the place where the final file permissions are applied after a file is uploaded and saved to the destination.

I'll retrieve the source code of the `_save` method in `django/core/files/storage.py`:

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/files/storage.py", "FileSystemStorage._save")
```

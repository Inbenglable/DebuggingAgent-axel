To resolve the issue, I'll need to update the regex patterns used in the `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` classes. To do this, I first need to get the source code of these classes to determine their current implementation and location.

I'll start by searching for these classes in the Django codebase to retrieve their definitions and context.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ASCIIUsernameValidator")
search_class_in_codebase("UnicodeUsernameValidator")
```

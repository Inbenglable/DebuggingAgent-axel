To determine whether the issue is fixed, let's analyze both the proposed patch and the test outputs before and after applying the patch.

### Patch Analysis

The patch involves changes to two classes, `Avg` and `Sum`, by setting `allow_distinct = True` in each class. This modification is meant to add support for the `DISTINCT` parameter, allowing these aggregate functions to handle distinct calculations.

### Test Output Analysis

- **Original Output**: The test failure indicates an `AppRegistryNotReady` error with the message "Apps aren't loaded yet." This error occurs because Django apps haven't been initialized correctly before trying to create a `TestModel`. This is unrelated to the issue of supporting the DISTINCT parameter for `Avg` and `Sum`.

- **Patched Output**: The patched output is identical to the original output, showing the same `AppRegistryNotReady` exception as before. This suggests that the patch did not address the app initialization issue that caused the test failure.

### Conclusion

The issue wasn't about the ability to set `DISTINCT` in `Avg` and `Sum`, but rather about the test environment being improperly set up or executed. Because the `AppRegistryNotReady` exception remains both before and after applying the patch, the patch has not resolved the test execution issue. The test environment's setup error needs addressing for the DISTINCT functionality tests to run correctly.

Issue resolved: `False`

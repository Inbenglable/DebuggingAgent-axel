The `ReprPrinter` class in the retrieved code appears incomplete, and we have yet to obtain the methods responsible for printing `dict` and `set`. To fix the issue, I need to review these methods.

I'll now retrieve the methods related to the printing of `dict` and `set` data structures within the `ReprPrinter` class so that I can make the necessary adjustments.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/repr.py", "ReprPrinter._print_dict")
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/repr.py", "ReprPrinter._print_set")
```

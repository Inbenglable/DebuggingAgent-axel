The issue arises from the `posify` function, which removes the finite and other assumptions of symbols when replacing them with positive dummy symbols. This is due to the fact it only changes symbols with `positive=None` without preserving other assumptions.

To fix the issue, we need to modify the `posify` function so that it retains these additional assumptions while replacing symbols. Since I've already obtained the source code of the `posify` function, I can proceed to generate a patch for the method.

Ready generation: `True`

The patch attempts to resolve the issue by explicitly converting the `offer_slug` fetched from `kwargs` to a string using `str()`, which aligns with suggested fixes for handling `SimpleLazyObjects`.

However, the given test results highlight an error unrelated to the bug being addressed: 

Both the original and patched outputs show the following error:

```
django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: Requested setting INSTALLED_APPS, but settings are not configured. You must either define the environment variable DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE or call settings.configure() before accessing settings.
```

This indicates an issue with the test setup, specifically that `settings.configure()` is not applied correctly before accessing settings. The problem with `SimpleLazyObject` conversion hasn't been verified because the test environment failed to initialize properly.

Therefore, the test results are inconclusive regarding whether the patch resolves the original issue with `SimpleLazyObject` and `TemplateView.get_context_data()`. The outputs suggest that the tests were not successfully executed.

Issue resolved: `False`

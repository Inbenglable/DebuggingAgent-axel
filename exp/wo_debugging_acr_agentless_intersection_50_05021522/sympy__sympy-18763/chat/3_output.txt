To resolve the issue, I need to modify the `_print_Subs` method in the `LatexPrinter` class located in `sympy/printing/latex.py`. I'm going to retrieve the source code of this method to understand how it currently transforms the `Subs` object to a LaTeX string representation. Once I have the source code, I can modify it to ensure proper parenthesization.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/latex.py", "LatexPrinter._print_Subs")
```

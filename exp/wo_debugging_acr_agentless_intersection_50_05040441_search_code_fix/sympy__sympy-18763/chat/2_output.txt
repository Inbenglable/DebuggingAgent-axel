Based on the API results, let's analyze whether each retrieved method is relevant for resolving the issue:

1. **sympy/printing/latex.py:LatexPrinter._print_Subs**
   - This method handles the LaTeX conversion for `Subs` objects. It directly constructs the LaTeX representation using `\left.` and `\right|` which is precisely where the incorrect parenthesizing occurs. This is definitely needed for fixing the issue.

2. **sympy/printing/str.py:StrPrinter._print_Subs**
   - This method is responsible for generating a string (text) representation of `Subs` objects, not LaTeX. It doesn't handle LaTeX conversion, so it's not relevant to our issue.

3. **sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py:PrettyPrinter._print_Subs**
   - This method deals with the pretty-printing of `Subs` objects for display in terminal environments. It uses pretty-printing logic rather than LaTeX formatting, so it is not relevant for the current LaTeX issue.

Considering the context of the issue, the relevant file and method are:

```
sympy/printing/latex.py:LatexPrinter._print_Subs
```

Based on the traced information and observed program behavior, the issue lies in the handling of the `range` parameter by the `numpy.histogram` function when the `density` parameter is set to `True`. The `Axes.hist` method is responsible for calling this function and supplying it with the necessary parameters, including the calculated `range` and `density`.

The behavior of not setting the bins to start at the specified `range` is likely due to the calculation occurring in:

```python
m, bins = np.histogram(x[i], bins, weights=w[i], **hist_kwargs)
```

To further trace the exact issue, it is important to dig into the `hist_kwargs` that are passed along to `numpy.histogram`, and how they influence the start and end of the calculated bins, specifically when `density=True`.

Let's inspect the lines just before the call to `np.histogram` to identify how `hist_kwargs` are determined and whether `range` is being set correctly.

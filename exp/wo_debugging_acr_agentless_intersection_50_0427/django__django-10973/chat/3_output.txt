To resolve the issue described, I need to locate the specific method in the Django PostgreSQL backend that executes the client command. Since the previous searches did not yield relevant results, I need to perform a search specifically within the Django PostgreSQL backend to find the `client` method.

I will attempt to search for the method related to the PostgreSQL client command again:

```python
search_method_in_codebase("client")
search_code_in_codebase("PGPASSWORD")
```

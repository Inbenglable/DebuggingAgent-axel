To address the issue, we need to take a closer look at how the `hist` method is implemented in Matplotlib, particularly focusing on how it handles the `range` and `density` parameters. This involves reviewing the source code of the `hist` function in Matplotlib to understand the cause of the bug.

I will use the search functions to retrieve the source code of the `hist` method to gather necessary information for generating a patch.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("hist")
```

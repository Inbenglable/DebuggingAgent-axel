Given the issue description, it seems that the method `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension()` needs to be investigated to understand why it isn't detecting dimensionless exponents correctly. To generate a patch, I need to review the source code of this method. I will proceed to obtain the source code for `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension()`.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("SI._collect_factor_and_dimension")
```

After analyzing the provided information, let's break down the situation:

1. **Issue Description**: The issue is with `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` not using the `tzinfo` parameter properly when converting dates.

2. **Test**: The test given attempts to reproduce this issue by creating entries in the database with timezones and then using `TruncDate` with a specific timezone (`America/New_York`). It compares the output to expected results considering the timezone.

3. **Original Test Output**: The original provided output contains an error due to a missing table (`__main___timeslots`), which prevents the test from running successfully.

4. **Patch**: The patch itself addresses the original implementation to properly consider the `tzinfo` parameter when provided, falling back to the default behavior otherwise. However, it does not address the database setup problem causing the test to fail.

5. **Patched Test Output**: The output remains unchanged after applying the patch because the primary error is due to the database setup problem (missing table), not the logic within the `TruncDate` or `TruncTime`.

The test can't verify the logic fix as it fails due to a setup error. Without addressing the database setup error, there's no confirmation that the patch resolves the original issue regarding timezone handling.

Given this, the issue is not resolved based on the current test outputs:

Issue resolved: `False`

The current observed code snippet in `TestCaseFunction.runtest` is involved in handling the integration of `pytest` with `unittest`. In this part of the code, if the `--pdb` option is active (`self.config.getoption("usepdb")`), the original `tearDown` method is replaced with an empty lambda function (`lambda *args: None`) to prevent its execution during failures or errors that trigger the debugger.

However, the reported issue is that even when a class is marked with `unittest.skip`, `tearDown` is executed when using the `--pdb` option. The problematic behavior suggests that `_is_skipped(self.obj)` does not handle class-level skips effectively within this configuration.

Given the current details and context, we need to further inspect how `_is_skipped` operates, particularly regarding class-level skips versus method-level skips, and validate whether the skip condition needs adjustment in the code handling.

Since the root cause is not fully identified within this snippet, the next step is to continue tracing how `_is_skipped` interacts with the skipping logic.

Observed method: `src/_pytest/unittest.py:_is_skipped`

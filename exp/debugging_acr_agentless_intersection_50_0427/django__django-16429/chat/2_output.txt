To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code of the `timesince` method in the `django/utils/timesince.py` file, as this is where the error occurs. Specifically, I need to identify how the `pivot` is being created and understand its current implementation. Hence, I will search for the `timesince` method within this file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/utils/timesince.py", "timesince")
```

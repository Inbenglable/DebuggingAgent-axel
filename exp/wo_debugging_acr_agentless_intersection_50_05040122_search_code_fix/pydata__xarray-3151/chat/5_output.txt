To determine whether the issue has been resolved, let's go through the steps.

### Patch Review

The patch modifies a section of code responsible for checking the monotonicity of coordinates during the `combine_by_coords` operation. The patch introduces a condition where, if all coordinate values are identical across datasets (`all(index.equals(indexes[0]) for index in indexes)`), it assumes the coordinates are effectively "ascending" or aligned, and skips the monotonicity check.

This modification aligns with the documented behavior, which states that identical coordinate dimensions should be ignored if they do not vary between datasets.

### Test Output Analysis

#### Original Output

Before applying the patch, the test output shows that a `ValueError` was raised when trying to combine datasets with non-monotonic but identical coordinates. This matches the described issue.

#### Patched Output

After applying the patch, the test output remained the same. The `ValueError` was still raised with the same message. This indicates that the patch did not successfully address the issue as intended.

### Conclusion

Based on the unchanged test output after applying the patch, the issue is not resolved. The patch did not prevent the `ValueError` from being raised, indicating that the implementation of the patch does not achieve the desired functionality.

**Issue resolved: `False`**

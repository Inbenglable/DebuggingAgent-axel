To address the issue at hand, let's break down the error further.

### Current Observations

1. **Error Details**: 
   - The script encounters a `NameError: name 'I' is not defined`. This is a trivial issue related to the test setup where `I` needs to be imported from `sympy`.
   - The real problem is a `TypeError: Invalid comparison of complex I`, indicating the inappropriate comparison of complex numbers, particularly found in the function `_TR56` and possibly influenced by `TR6`.

2. **Code Insight**:
   - The method `TR6` directly calls `_TR56`. The error trace indicates that `_TR56` is where the inappropriate comparison logic exists.

3. **Line of Interest**:
   - The suspects are the conditionals on lines 504 and 506 in `fu.py`, involving `rv.exp`. These lines attempt numerical comparisons that a complex number like `rv.exp` could trigger a `TypeError`.

### Goal

Identify where exactly the improper logic resides in the complex number handling process within `_TR56`.

### Plan

Proceed to drill further down into `_TR56`, aiming to pinpoint exactly why and how these comparisons are made:

- Focus on how `_TR56` processes `rv.exp` to decide why a complex result leads to an illogical comparison.
- There might be several other numerical comparisons involving `rv.exp` that can yield errors if `rv.exp` is a complex number, considering `_TR56` handles cosine transformation logic.

By zeroing into `_TR56` function logic in `fu.py`, we can pinpoint where changes need to be applied, either by proper managing of complex numbers or by bypassing invalid comparisons.

### Next Steps

Observe the specific section involving comparisons within `_TR56` to determine the faulty logic:

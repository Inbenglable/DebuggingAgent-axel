To address the `IndexError` in the method `_split_gcd` in `sympy/simplify/radsimp.py`, we should ensure that the function handles cases where the input list `a` might be empty. We'll add a check at the beginning of the function to return `g, [], []` if `a` is empty. This fix retains the original functionality while ensuring that the function doesn't crash when called with an empty list.

Here's the patch to achieve this:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/simplify/radsimp.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    g = a[0]\n=======\n    if not a:\n        return None, [], []\n    g = a[0]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This edit ensures that if `_split_gcd` is called with an empty argument, it gracefully returns a tuple with `None` and two empty lists, preventing the `IndexError`.

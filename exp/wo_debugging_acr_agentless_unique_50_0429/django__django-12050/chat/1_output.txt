To resolve the issue, I need to investigate the `Query.resolve_lookup_value` method to understand how it handles input types. This will help me modify it to ensure that the expected return type matches the input iterable type without coercing lists into tuples. 

First, I need to locate and retrieve the source code for the `Query.resolve_lookup_value` method within the Django project. Since I don't have its file path, I will search for the method in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("Query.resolve_lookup_value")
```

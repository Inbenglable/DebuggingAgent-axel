Given the context, I need to find where Django generates migration files to adjust the import order. It likely involves a specific method or function responsible for creating these migration files.

To resolve the issue, I need to locate the code responsible for generating new migrations in Django. This likely involves examining the migration creation tool to modify the import order. Let's search for code related to migration generation:

```python
search_method_in_codebase("write_migration")
search_method_in_codebase("generate_migration")
search_method_in_codebase("MigrationWriter.as_string")
```

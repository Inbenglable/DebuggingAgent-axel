To address the issue mentioned, I need to review the source code where the `combine_attrs` logic is being handled within the `merge` functionality. The issue references a specific line number in `xarray/core/merge.py`, which suggests that this file contains the relevant code. To proceed, I'll retrieve the code associated with the relevant section in the `merge` method to ensure the changes can be made appropriately.

```python
search_code_in_file("xarray/core/merge.py", "return variable_attrs[0]")
```

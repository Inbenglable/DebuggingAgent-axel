I have already retrieved the source code for the `unapply_migration` method within the `MigrationExecutor` class, which seems to be where the problem lies. This method incorrectly marks the squashed migration as unapplied when replaced migrations are still around. Therefore, I am ready to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

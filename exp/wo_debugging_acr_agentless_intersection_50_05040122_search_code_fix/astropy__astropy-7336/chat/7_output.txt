To resolve the issue with the `units.quantity_input` decorator failing when a constructor has a return type of `None`, we need to adjust the handling code to account for this. The relevant code section checks if `wrapped_signature.return_annotation` is not empty and then attempts to call the `to` method on the returned value. The fix involves explicitly checking if the returned value is `None`.

Here's the necessary patch in SEARCH/REPLACE format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### astropy/units/decorators.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                return return_.to(wrapped_signature.return_annotation)\n=======\n                if return_ is not None:\n                    return return_.to(wrapped_signature.return_annotation)\n                else:\n                    return return_\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This edit includes the relevant code and ensures that if the return value (`return_`) is `None`, the decorator does not attempt to call the `to` method, thus preventing the `AttributeError`.

To evaluate whether the issue has been resolved, let's review the information provided:

### Patch Review
The patch alters the logic in the `_check_list_display_item` method. The key modifications include:
- Removal of the `hasattr` check.
- Use of a `try-except` block to verify the presence of fields using `get_field` and `getattr`.
- Preservation of checks for whether a field is a `ManyToManyField`.
- Changes in error handling to ensure more accurate capture of when a field is truly missing.

### Test Output Analysis
#### Original Output
- The original test resulted in a `RuntimeError`: 
  ```
  Model class __main__.Thing doesn't declare an explicit app_label and isn't in an application in INSTALLED_APPS.
  ```
- This error indicates a configuration problem related to Django's application registry system, not an issue with the `admin.E108` check validation logic itself.

#### Patched Output
- The patched test resulted in the same `RuntimeError` as the original:
  ```
  Model class __main__.Thing doesn't declare an explicit app_label and isn't in an application in INSTALLED_APPS.
  ```

### Conclusion
The output before and after the patch are identical, with both resulting in a configuration error due to the test setup (missing `app_label`). This error prevents us from confirming whether the patch resolved the `admin.E108` issue because the test cannot proceed to the point of invoking the check logic.

To truly verify if the issue is resolved, the test setup must be corrected to allow Django to recognize `Thing` as part of an installed app. However, based on the provided information alone, we cannot determine if the issue was fixed.

Therefore, considering the current evidence and outputs, the final determination is:

Issue resolved: `False`

To determine whether the issue is resolved, we'll review the patch and analyze the test outputs before and after applying the patch.

## Patch Review
The patch introduces an initialization of the `substitutions` variable at the beginning of the relevant section in the `post_process` method of `django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py`. The patch sets `substitutions = []` before it is used in a conditional statement. This prevents the `UnboundLocalError` that occurs due to `substitutions` being referenced before assignment when `max_post_process_passes` is set to 0, which is the original issue reported.

## Test Output Analysis
- **Original Output:** The error message specifically states that there's an `UnboundLocalError` related to the `max_post_process_passes = 0` setting, indicating that `substitutions` wasn't initialized properly.

- **Patched Output:** The output points to an `AppRegistryNotReady` exception. The error message details that "Apps aren't loaded yet," which is unrelated to the `UnboundLocalError` initially reported. It seems the test encountered an unrelated issue. However, crucially, there is no mention of an `UnboundLocalError` in this output.

## Conclusion
Given that the specific issue of the `UnboundLocalError` for the variable `substitutions` is not present in the patched output, the patch seems to have addressed the particular problem of initializing `substitutions`. The `AppRegistryNotReady` error indicates a separate setup problem in the testing environment, but it does not imply that the variable substitution issue persists.

Therefore, since the originally reported issue concerning `UnboundLocalError` seems to be fixed within the scope of the described patch and test outputs, the issue is:
Issue resolved: `True`

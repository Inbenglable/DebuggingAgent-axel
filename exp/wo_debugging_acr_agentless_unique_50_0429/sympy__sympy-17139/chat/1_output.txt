To address the issue at hand, I need to inspect the source code of the `TR6` method in the `fu.py` file, as well as the `_TR56` method, since the problem involves these methods. Additionally, I need to verify the logic of the `bottom_up` function. Let's proceed by retrieving the necessary source code with the following search operations:

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/simplify/fu.py", "TR6")
search_method_in_file("sympy/simplify/fu.py", "_TR56")
search_method_in_file("sympy/simplify/simplify.py", "bottom_up")
```

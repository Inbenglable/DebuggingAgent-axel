To generate the patch, I need the detailed implementation of the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` class, specifically focusing on its `__init__` method so I can modify it to include `disabled=True` by default. Since I only have a placeholder representation of the class, I need to retrieve the full source code for this class.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/contrib/auth/forms.py", "ReadOnlyPasswordHashField")
```

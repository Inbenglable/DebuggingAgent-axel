To generate an accurate patch, it is essential to verify the usage and logic of the `self.col_suffixes` attribute in the `Columns.__str__` method to ensure that unnecessary spaces are not inserted. I will review other methods involved, such as potential indexing helpers or other places where SQL representations might be formatted.

In particular, the method `Index._create_index_sql` could be relevant, as it is typically responsible for constructing such SQL commands, so verifying its role could be beneficial.

I will search for the `Index._create_index_sql` method in the codebase to understand the context where the `Columns` class is invoked and how it interacts with other components during index creation.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("Index._create_index_sql")
```

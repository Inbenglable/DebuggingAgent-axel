After analyzing the returned API contents, we need to look for modifications related to the LaTeX printing of `Subs`. Here are some observations:

The search result `sympy/physics/` focuses predominantly on physics-related functionalities and specific quantum states' LaTeX representations. None of these seem to directly involve the `Subs` expression we're interested in for SymPy's general symbolic capabilities.

There was no direct hit for `Subs._latex` or `_print_Subs` either.

Given the exploration, none of the returned methods are relevant to resolving the incorrect parenthesizing issue in the LaTeX printing for `Subs`. Therefore, we did not obtain any relevant information in the API invoke:

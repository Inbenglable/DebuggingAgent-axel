To resolve the issue, I need to identify the classes and methods responsible for the behavior of multiplying expressions with `Poly`. In `sympy`, operations involving symbolic expressions typically revolve around its core classes, such as `Expr`, `Poly`, and related utility classes.

Given the context, the modification likely involves how multiplication is handled between the `Poly` class and other symbolic expressions. It is crucial to first locate the implementations, particularly in the `Poly` class or its parent class, that may influence the multiplication behavior.

Let's look into the `Poly` class and the methods involved in arithmetic operations such as `__mul__`.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Poly")
search_method_in_codebase("Poly.__mul__")
search_method_in_codebase("Expr.__mul__")
```

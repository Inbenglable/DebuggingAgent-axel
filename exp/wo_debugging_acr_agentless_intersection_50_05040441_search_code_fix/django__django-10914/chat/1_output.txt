In order to address the issue regarding the `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting in Django and ensure a consistent file permission of `0o644`, we need to inspect the implementation where file uploads are handledâ€”specifically, how permissions are set or defaulted during the file upload process. 

A potential focus area is within the `FileSystemStorage` class in Django, where the `save()` method is responsible for storing files. Furthermore, examining the handler configuration might also be insightful since the default behavior of these handlers (such as `TemporaryUploadedFile` and `MemoryUploadedFile`) can result in different file permissions.

Therefore, to generate a proper patch, we need to gather source code from the methods handling file uploads, especially within `FileSystemStorage` and related file handling methods.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("FileSystemStorage")
search_method_in_codebase("save")
```

To address the issue, I need to check the implementation of the `diophantine` function in SymPy to understand how it processes symbolic expressions with the `permute` option. 

I will retrieve the source code of the `diophantine` function to investigate its logic and determine why the permutation isn't consistent across different symbol orders.

Since I do not know the file path of the `diophantine` method, I will search for it in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("diophantine")
```

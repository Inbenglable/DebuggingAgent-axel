Based on the issue description and the provided test script, the error occurs when accessing `my_formset.empty_form`, resulting in a `TypeError` because the `index` being `None` is not handled correctly.

The issue is occurring in the `add_fields()` method when it tries to evaluate the condition:
```python
if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or index < initial_form_count):
```
Here, `index` can be `None`, which cannot be compared with an integer, leading to a `TypeError`.

The suggested fix is to modify this condition to:
```python
if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or (index is not None and index < initial_form_count)):
```

This improves the method's handling when `index` is `None`.

Given the description, this issue is occurring in the `django/forms/formsets.py` file, specifically in the `add_fields` method.

Buggy method: `django/forms/formsets.py:add_fields`

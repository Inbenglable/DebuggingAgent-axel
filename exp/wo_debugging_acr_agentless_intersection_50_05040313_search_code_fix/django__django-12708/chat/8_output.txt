To determine whether the issue has been resolved, let's first review the changes introduced by the patch and then compare the test outputs before and after the patch.

### Patch Review:
The patch aims to change the behavior of the `_delete_composed_index` function by introducing a method `_is_unique_constraint` that differentiates between unique constraints and index constraints. It modifies the logic to:

1. Keep only the constraints that do not match the unique constraint criteria.
2. Raise an error if there are multiple constraints still present.

### Analysis of Test Outputs:
- **Original Output**:
  - Error Message: `ValueError: Found wrong number (2) of constraints for test_app_testmodel(field1, field2)`.
  - This error indicates the migration fails due to the confusion between the unique constraint and the index constraint.

- **Patched Output**:
  - Error Message: `ValueError: Found multiple constraints for test_app_testmodel(field1, field2). Ensure only one index or correct the logic`.
  - The error message has changed slightly, but it continues to fail due to the presence of multiple constraints.

### Conclusion:
The patch's introduction of a differentiation function did not resolve the underlying issue as demonstrated by the fact that the migration still fails with an error about constraints. The patch only adjusted how the error is displayed, suggesting improvements in understanding the situation but not in resolving it.

Thus, based on the unchanged failure in migrating the constraint (though with a slightly altered error message), the issue is not resolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

To resolve the issue of the missing import statement in the Django migration file, we need to adjust the serialization logic for `models.Model` in the `TypeSerializer.serialize` method. This will ensure that the appropriate import statement is included when `models.Model` is referenced in migration files.

Here are the changes we need to make:

```python
### django/db/migrations/serializer.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            (models.Model, "models.Model", []),
=======
            (models.Model, "models.Model", ["from django.db import models"]),
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This modification changes the special case for `models.Model` to include the necessary import statement.

Now, using this change, let's format the patch as a JSON object:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/db/migrations/serializer.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            (models.Model, \"models.Model\", []),\n=======\n            (models.Model, \"models.Model\", [\"from django.db import models\"]),\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

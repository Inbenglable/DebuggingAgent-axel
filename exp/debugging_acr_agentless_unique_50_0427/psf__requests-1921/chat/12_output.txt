To determine whether the issue is fixed, let's analyze the provided information.

### Original Issue:
The original issue is that setting a session header to `None` with `session.headers['Accept-Encoding'] = None` results in the header being sent with the value "None" instead of being removed entirely. The error also produces a `TypeError` because `None` is not a valid header value type.

### Patch Context Analysis:
The patch modifies the `prepare_headers` method in `requests/models.py` so that headers with a value of `None` are excluded from the `CaseInsensitiveDict` of headers.

### Original Output:
The `TypeError` is raised because setting the header to `None` results in an invalid header value being processed further down the line.

### Patched Output:
In the patched output, no error is raised, and the `Accept-Encoding` header is excluded from the headers sent with the request. This is evidenced by the absence of 'Accept-Encoding' in the output.

### Conclusion:
The patch successfully addresses the issue by excluding any headers with a `None` value from being sent, thereby resolving the `TypeError` and adhering to the desired behavior of not sending the header if it is set to `None`.

Issue resolved: `True`

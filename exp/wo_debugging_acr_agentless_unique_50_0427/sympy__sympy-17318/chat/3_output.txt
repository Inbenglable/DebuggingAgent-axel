The issue arises when the `_split_gcd` function is called with an empty tuple in its arguments, which leads to an IndexError. To prevent this error from occurring, it can be modified to handle the case when `a` is empty. Additionally, we may need to add a check in the `split_surds` function to ensure it doesn't pass empty surds as arguments. Here's the suggested patch:

```pythony
### sympy/simplify/radsimp.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    g = a[0]
=======
    if not a:
        return S.One, [], []
    g = a[0]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```pythony
### sympy/simplify/radsimp.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    surds = [x[1]**2 for x in coeff_muls if x[1].is_Pow]
=======
    surds = [x[1]**2 for x in coeff_muls if x[1].is_Pow and x[1].exp == S.Half]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These patches introduce checks to handle the case where no surds are found, avoiding empty input to `_split_gcd` which results in an IndexError.

Let's proceed with applying these adjustments.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/simplify/radsimp.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    g = a[0]\n=======\n    if not a:\n        return S.One, [], []\n    g = a[0]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### sympy/simplify/radsimp.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    surds = [x[1]**2 for x in coeff_muls if x[1].is_Pow]\n=======\n    surds = [x[1]**2 for x in coeff_muls if x[1].is_Pow and x[1].exp == S.Half]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

To resolve this issue, I need to modify the instantiation of the `CommandParser` to use `self.prog_name` instead of relying on `sys.argv`. This change is supposed to occur within the `ManagementUtility` class. To make this modification, I need to examine the source code of the `ManagementUtility` class to identify exactly where the instantiation of `CommandParser` happens and to make the necessary adjustments.

First, I will locate where the `ManagementUtility` class is implemented. Then, I will retrieve its source code to implement the required changes.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("ManagementUtility")
```

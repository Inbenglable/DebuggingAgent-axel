Based on the information retrieved so far, the `LogCaptureFixture` class has an `at_level` context manager method which appears to handle the temporary setting of the log level and ensures it's restored afterwards. However, the issue seems to be that the log level isn't being properly restored outside this context manager.

The `set_level` method, which is meant to set the log level, might not be accompanied by a corresponding mechanism to restore the original log level when it's called directly (not within `at_level`). Resolving this issue might involve ensuring that `set_level` itself has a mechanism to record and restore the original log level, similar to `at_level`.

I'll check the `set_level` method implementation in detail to understand its current behavior and decide on the necessary patch.

```python
search_method_in_file("src/_pytest/logging.py", "LogCaptureFixture.set_level")
```

To resolve the issue, we need to identify where the `floatformat` template filter is implemented in the Django codebase. The problem is related to conversion issues within this filter, specifically with handling `Decimal` objects.

To generate the patch, we need to inspect the `floatformat` implementation. As we don't have the file path yet, I need to search for the method in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("floatformat")
```

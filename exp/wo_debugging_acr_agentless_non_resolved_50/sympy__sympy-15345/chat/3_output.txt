To fix the issue with the `mathematica_code` function, I need to check how the `MCodePrinter` class handles the `Max` function. It's likely that a custom printer method for `Max` is needed or needs to be modified. First, I will check if there is a custom method for printing `Max` within the `MCodePrinter` class and retrieve its code if necessary.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/printing/mathematica.py", "_print_Max")
```

To determine whether the issue is fixed, let's analyze both the patch and the outputs before and after applying the patch.

### Patch Analysis
The patch modifies the `add_field` method in the `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py` file, making sure that if a field is nullable and has a unique constraint, the table is remade rather than using a simple `ALTER TABLE` operation. This prevents the SQLite error due to the unique constraint on a nullable field.

### Test Output Analysis

- **Original Output:**
  ```
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-15278/reproduce.py", line 56, in <module>
      class Migration(migrations.Migration):
    File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-15278/reproduce.py", line 66, in Migration
      field=migrations.OneToOneField(blank=True, null=True, on_delete=migrations.SET_NULL, to='oauth2_provider.refreshtoken', related_name="refreshed_access_token"),
  AttributeError: module 'django.db.migrations' has no attribute 'OneToOneField'
  ```

- **Patched Output:**
  ```
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-15278/reproduce.py", line 56, in <module>
      class Migration(migrations.Migration):
    File "/data/swe-fl/TMP/testbed/django__django-15278/reproduce.py", line 66, in Migration
      field=migrations.OneToOneField(blank=True, null=True, on_delete=migrations.SET_NULL, to='oauth2_provider.refreshtoken', related_name="refreshed_access_token"),
  AttributeError: module 'django.db.migrations' has no attribute 'OneToOneField'
  ```

The issue here is that both outputs before and after applying the patch are the same and indicate a different error â€“ an `AttributeError` because the code is incorrectly attempting to access `OneToOneField` from `django.db.migrations`.

### Conclusion

The patch seems conceptually correct for addressing the SQLite error, but the provided test script is incorrectly written and does not actually test the specific SQLite bug due to the incorrect usage of `migrations.OneToOneField`. Therefore, we cannot ascertain whether the patch resolves the issue since the reproduced test did not execute successfully due to a different error.

Therefore, based on the available information:

Issue resolved: `False`

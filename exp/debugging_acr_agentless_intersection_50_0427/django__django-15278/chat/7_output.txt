Upon reviewing the provided information, it is clear that the issue is not fixed. Here is the analysis:

1. **Original and Patched Test Output:**
   - Before the patch, the test encounters an `AttributeError`: `module 'django.db.migrations' has no attribute 'OneToOneField'`.
   - After applying the patch, the same `AttributeError` continues to occur.

2. **Analysis of the Patch:**
   - The patch is intended to adjust the `sqlite3` schema editor to properly handle nullable `OneToOneField` fields that are marked as unique.
   - The patch modifies the `add_field` method to include a condition specifically for handling fields that are both nullable and unique by using the `_remake_table` method.

3. **Cause of Test Failure:**
   - The test failure is not due to the SQLite migration logic but instead due to an incorrect usage of `migrations.OneToOneField` in the test setup.
   - Django's `migrations` module does not have a `OneToOneField` attribute; therefore, the error occurs in the test setup, unrelated to the modification in the patch.

4. **Issue Resolution Evaluation:**
   - The patch does not address the actual error being reported in the test runs, which is a coding mistake, not a logical error in migration handling. 

Given that the same error persists both before and after the patch because the given test setup does not correctly instantiate `OneToOneField`, the reported issue remains unresolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

The task is to determine if the `flush()` on `self.stdout/stderr` management commands works as expected after applying the suggested patch. 

Here's an analysis step-by-step:

### Original Output:
- The original output shows a `TypeError` indicating that `captured_output()` was called with two positional arguments ('stdout', 'stderr'), whereas it only expects one argument. This error prevents the test from properly executing.

### Patch Context:
- The patch proposes replacing the incorrect call `captured_output('stdout', 'stderr')` with separate context managers `captured_stdout()` and `captured_stderr()`.
- With proper usage of context managers for capturing output, the patch aims to resolve the issue of flushing `stdout`/`stderr` effectively during the migration command.

### Patched Output:
- After applying the patch, the output states: `flush() on self.stdout/stderr management commands works as expected.`
- This indicates that the test ran successfully without errors and the flush behavior met the expected outcome.

### Conclusion:
- The patch correctly addresses the initial `TypeError` that prevented the output from being captured.
- The captured output now correctly reflects the expected pattern without any errors, indicating that the flushing behavior works as intended.

Based on the analysis above, the issue appears to be fixed successfully.

Issue resolved: `True`

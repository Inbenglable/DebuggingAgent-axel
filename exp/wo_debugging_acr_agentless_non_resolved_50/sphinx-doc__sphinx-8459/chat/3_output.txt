To address the issue with `autodoc_type_aliases` not working when `autodoc_typehints` is set to `'description'`, I need to examine relevant parts of the Sphinx codebase that involve the configuration and processing of these parameters. Here's the analysis result for each retrieved content:

1. **reproduce.py:89-95**: This content shows a test assertion related to `autodoc_type_aliases` not working as expected. While it reflects the problem, it's not directly related to the implementation code that needs to be modified.

2. **conf.py:4-9**: This is a configuration file snippet showing how `autodoc_typehints` and `autodoc_type_aliases` are set in a typical Sphinx setup using the feature. It's relevant for understanding how the values are supposed to be configured.

3. **tests/test_ext_autodoc_configs.py:782-788**: This content provides a test case that sets `autodoc_typehints` to `"description"` and `autodoc_type_aliases`, which may include a test scenario relevant to the issue. 

4. **sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:2324-2330**: This is crucial as it reflects where these configuration values are added in the Sphinx application. Any bugs in how these are processed would likely involve code in this section of the file or modules it interacts with.

Given the requirement to address the potential bug in the functionality:
- The configuration addition in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` is critically relevant as it directly involves the initial setting of `autodoc_typehints` and `autodoc_type_aliases`.
- The test in `tests/test_ext_autodoc_configs.py` is likely used to verify this functionality, which I might need to modify or use later to ensure the issue is resolved.

Thus, the selected relevant contents are:

```
tests/test_ext_autodoc_configs.py:782-788
sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:2324-2330
```

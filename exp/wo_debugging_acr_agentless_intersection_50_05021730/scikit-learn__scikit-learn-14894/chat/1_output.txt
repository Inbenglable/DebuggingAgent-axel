To resolve the issue of `ZeroDivisionError` for an empty `support_vectors_` in the `_sparse_fit` method of the `SVM` class within the `scikit-learn` project, I need to retrieve and review the implementation of the `_sparse_fit` method. Since I don't have the file path, I'll search for the method in the entire codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("_sparse_fit")
```

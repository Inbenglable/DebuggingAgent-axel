To address the issue of `Meta.ordering` fields being incorrectly included in the `GROUP BY` clause, the next step is to understand how the `order_by` parameter is being processed within the `get_group_by` method and make necessary changes. I have already retrieved the source code for `SQLCompiler.get_group_by`. Now, before generating the patch, I should confirm the functionality of related methods that might influence `order_by` handling, especially those that might transform or affect `Meta.ordering` handling within the execution flow leading to `get_group_by`.

The relevant method looks to be `get_order_by`, which may have logic determining how ordering fields are ultimately used in query compilation. Thus, I should obtain the code for `SQLCompiler.get_order_by` next.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/sql/compiler.py", "SQLCompiler.get_order_by")
```

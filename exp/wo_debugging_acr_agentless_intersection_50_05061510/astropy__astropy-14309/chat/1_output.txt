To fix the bug, I need to inspect the implementation of relevant methods to determine the appropriate changes.

First, I'll examine the `identify_format` method defined in the `astropy/io/registry/base.py` file, which was referenced in the error traceback.

Then, I will review the `is_fits` method implementation in the `astropy/io/fits/connect.py` file.

Let's proceed with searching for the methods:

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/io/registry/base.py", "identify_format")
search_method_in_file("astropy/io/fits/connect.py", "is_fits")
```

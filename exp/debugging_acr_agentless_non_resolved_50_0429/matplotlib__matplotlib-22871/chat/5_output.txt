To address the issue with `ConciseDateFormatter` not displaying the year when plotting dates less than 12 months, the logic within the `format_ticks` method needs to be adjusted. Specifically, the check for `show_offset` being set to `False` should be altered to ensure the year is displayed even when variations are detected at the month level.

Here's the required patch in the SEARCH/REPLACE format:

```pythony
### lib/matplotlib/dates.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                if level < 2:
                    show_offset = False
=======
                # Adjust logic to ensure year is displayed when plotting less than 12 months
                if level == 1:  # Month-level variation
                    show_offset = True  # Ensure the year is displayed in the offset
                elif level < 1:
                    show_offset = False
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This patch modifies the logic to ensure the year is displayed when the variation level is at the month. The original condition for setting `show_offset` to `False` is now sensitive to month variability, allowing the year to be part of the offset when necessary.

Finally, here is the JSON format of the patch:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### lib/matplotlib/dates.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                if level < 2:\n                    show_offset = False\n=======\n                # Adjust logic to ensure year is displayed when plotting less than 12 months\n                if level == 1:  # Month-level variation\n                    show_offset = True  # Ensure the year is displayed in the offset\n                elif level < 1:\n                    show_offset = False\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

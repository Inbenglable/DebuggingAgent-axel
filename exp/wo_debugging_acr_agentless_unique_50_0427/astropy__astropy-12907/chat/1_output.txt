To address the issue with the `separability_matrix` function in **astropy**, I need to review its current implementation and understand how it handles nested compound models. This requires retrieving the source code for the `separability_matrix` function.

Since I do not currently know the file path of the function, I will search for it across the whole project codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("separability_matrix")
```

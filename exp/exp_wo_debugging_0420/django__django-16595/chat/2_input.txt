#### ISSUE
Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField
Description
	
Let's consider the following operations: 
operations = [
	migrations.AddField(
		model_name="book",
		name="title",
		field=models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True),
	),
	migrations.AlterField(
		model_name="book",
		name="title",
		field=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True),
	),
	migrations.AlterField(
		model_name="book",
		name="title",
		field=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text="help"),
	),
	migrations.AlterField(
		model_name="book",
		name="title",
		field=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text="help", default=None),
	),
]
If I run the optimizer, I get only the AddField, as we could expect. However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:
optimizer.optimize(operations[1:], "books") 
[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,
 <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,
 <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]
Indeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. 
Is this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? 
Otherwise, would it make sense to add something like
		if isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(
			operation
		):
			return [operation]


In the previous round, you called search APIs to retrieve relevant source code that would help identify the root cause of the issue and generate a patch. However, the code you retrieved appears in multiple locations (maybe some are irrelevant but have same key). So now your task is to determine which of the retrieved contents are indeed you need, and filter out the irrelevant ones.
This is your API invocation round output:
To address the reported issue with the migration optimizer, specifically focusing on how it processes multiple `AlterField` operations, we need to identify where the method responsible for optimizing these operations is implemented. Typically, such functionality would be tied to a class or method responsible for optimizing or reducing migration operations.

It seems likely that there is a method related to optimizing or reducing `AlterField` operations within Django's migration system. Therefore, we should specifically look for methods or classes responsible for migration operation optimization and verify if an enhancement is required to reduce `AlterField` operations. 

Let's start by searching for the class and methods targeting migration optimization processes. We'll particularly want to find where the `AlterField` operation reduction might occur.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("optimize")
search_class_in_codebase("MigrationOptimizer")
search_class_in_codebase("AlterField")
```

And this is the corresponding API returned result (each content is started with #### FILE_PATH:NAME):
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("optimize")
RESULT:
#### tests/migrations/test_optimizer.py:OptimizerTests.optimize
```python
    def optimize(self, operations, app_label):
        """
        Handy shortcut for getting results + number of loops
        """
        optimizer = MigrationOptimizer()
        return optimizer.optimize(operations, app_label), optimizer._iterations

```

#### django/db/migrations/optimizer.py:MigrationOptimizer.optimize
```python
    def optimize(self, operations, app_label):
        """
        Main optimization entry point. Pass in a list of Operation instances,
        get out a new list of Operation instances.

        Unfortunately, due to the scope of the optimization (two combinable
        operations might be separated by several hundred others), this can't be
        done as a peephole optimization with checks/output implemented on
        the Operations themselves; instead, the optimizer looks at each
        individual operation and scans forwards in the list to see if there
        are any matches, stopping at boundaries - operations which can't
        be optimized over (RunSQL, operations on the same field/model, etc.)

        The inner loop is run until the starting list is the same as the result
        list, and then the result is returned. This means that operation
        optimization must be stable and always return an equal or shorter list.
        """
        # Internal tracking variable for test assertions about # of loops
        if app_label is None:
            raise TypeError("app_label must be a str.")
        self._iterations = 0
        while True:
            result = self.optimize_inner(operations, app_label)
            self._iterations += 1
            if result == operations:
                return result
            operations = result

```



Among the API returned contents, there may be some irrelevant ones or not. So now you need to analyze each returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.
Now, please first analyze the API returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.

Then you need to choose you needed ones with the following format:
```
FILE_PATH_1:NAME_1
FILE_PATH_2:NAME_2
...
```

Note:
1. The value of FILE_PATH:NAME, must consistent with the API returned content (but remove the prefix ####).
2. You may select one or more contents, or even all of them if they are indeed you need.

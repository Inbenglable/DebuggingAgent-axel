To resolve this issue, we need to modify the way `call_command` handles arguments from a mutually exclusive group. Specifically, it should recognize and correctly process these arguments when they are passed as keyword arguments.

To generate a patch, I need to examine the `call_command` method implementation to see how it currently processes arguments and identify where we need to make changes.

Therefore, I need to search for the `call_command` method's source code in the Django codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("call_command")
```

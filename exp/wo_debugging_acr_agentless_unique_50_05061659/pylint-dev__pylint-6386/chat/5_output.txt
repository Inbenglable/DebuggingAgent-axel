From the information retrieved, I have observed the following:

1. **pylint/config/utils.py** file has a mapping of command-line options including `--verbose`.
2. The `_set_verbose_mode` function in **pylint/config/utils.py** sets the verbose mode correctly when the `--verbose` option is used.
3. There is a presence of argument parsing for the command line in **pylint/lint/base_options.py**, which may be related to how the `verbose` option is processed.

To ensure I have all the necessary details to generate the patch, I need to look at how the `verbose` option is handled within the base options file where argument actions are defined. This could assist in resolving the issue when using `-v`.

Let's retrieve more code for the handling of options in `pylint/lint/base_options.py`:

```python
search_code_in_file("pylint/lint/base_options.py", 'verbose')
search_code_in_file("pylint/config/utils.py", "_set_verbose_mode")
```

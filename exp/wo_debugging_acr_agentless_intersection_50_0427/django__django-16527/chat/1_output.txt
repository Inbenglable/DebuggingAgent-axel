To resolve this issue, I need to examine whether the existing implementation around the "show_save_as_new" logic contains the intended permission checks. This logic pertains to the Django admin interfaces, likely found in the file `django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py`.

Since the description states that the change should be around line 102, I'll use the search APIs to retrieve the relevant code snippet in that file to verify and understand the current implementation. Afterwards, I can ensure that the proper permission checks are in place.

Let's proceed by searching the code snippet around the specified line.

```python
search_code_in_file("django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py", "show_save_as_new")
```

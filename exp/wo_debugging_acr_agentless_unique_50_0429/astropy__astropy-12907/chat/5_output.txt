To address the issue with the `separability_matrix` function inaccurately calculating the separability for nested `CompoundModels`, it appears that the function does not correctly handle nested compound models because of deficiencies in how the `_separable` and `_coord_matrix` functions compute the separability matrix. We'll primarily focus on updating `_coord_matrix` to account for nested models correctly.

Here's the necessary patch:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### astropy/modeling/separable.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if not model.separable:
=======
        if isinstance(model, CompoundModel):
            left_matrix = _coord_matrix(model.left, 'left', noutp)
            right_matrix = _coord_matrix(model.right, 'right', noutp)
            mat = np.hstack((left_matrix, right_matrix))
        elif not model.separable:
>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of the patch:

- **File:** `astropy/modeling/separable.py`
- **Location:** Within the `_coord_matrix` function
- **Modifications:** 
    - Inserted a check for whether the model is a `CompoundModel`.
    - If it is, recursively calculate the coordinate matrix for the left and right sub-models and combine them.
    - If it's not a `CompoundModel`, we use the existing logic for separable and non-separable models.

This change aims to ensure that the separability matrix computation correctly handles nested compound models by appropriately combining the separability matrices of the sub-models, thereby resolving the bug reported in the issue.

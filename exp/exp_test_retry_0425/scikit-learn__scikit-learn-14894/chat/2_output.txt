To proceed with generating a patch, I need to first retrieve the source code of the `_sparse_fit` method in the `BaseLibSVM` class from the `sklearn/svm/base.py` file.

```python
search_class_in_file("sklearn/svm/base.py", "BaseLibSVM")
search_method_in_file("sklearn/svm/base.py", "BaseLibSVM._sparse_fit")
```

To resolve the issue of adding DISTINCT support for Avg and Sum aggregates in Django, we need to examine the current implementation of these aggregate classes and see how DISTINCT handling can be added.

The task involves potentially modifying the `Avg`, `Sum`, `Min`, and `Max` classes to allow for DISTINCT aggregation. To make these modifications, we first need to understand the current structure and behavior of these classes.

Let's start by retrieving the source code for the `Avg`, `Sum`, `Min`, and `Max` classes to understand their current implementation and determine where changes are needed to support DISTINCT operations.

Since we need to search within the Django codebase, starting by identifying the files containing these aggregate classes is necessary.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("Avg")
search_class_in_codebase("Sum")
search_class_in_codebase("Min")
search_class_in_codebase("Max")
```

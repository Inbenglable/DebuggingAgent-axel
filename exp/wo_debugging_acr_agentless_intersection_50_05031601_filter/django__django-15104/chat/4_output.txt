The patch proposed for the issue modifies the `only_relation_agnostic_fields` method in the `MigrationAutodetector` to prevent a `KeyError` when the key `'to'` is missing. Specifically, it changes:

```python
del deconstruction[2]['to']
```

to

```python
deconstruction[2].pop('to', None)
```

This alteration safely removes the `'to'` key without raising an error if the key does not exist, which seems to be the correct approach to resolve the `KeyError`.

Now, analyzing the output of the test before and after the patch, both show the same error:

```
django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: Requested setting INSTALLED_APPS, but settings are not configured. You must either define the environment variable DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE or call settings.configure() before accessing settings.
```

This error is related to the Django settings configuration not being properly set up before accessing the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting, and it does not involve the `KeyError` that the patch aims to fix.

As neither the original nor the patched output shows a `KeyError`, the patch's effectiveness is not directly assessable from the provided outputs. However, the ImproperlyConfigured error should be resolved separately because it indicates that the test environment is not properly configured.

In conclusion, the specific issue related to the `KeyError` is addressed by the patch in theory, though it's not directly reflected or verifiable in the test outputs provided due to a different setup issue.

Therefore, based on the patch itself, but considering the irrelevant test output:

Issue resolved: `True`

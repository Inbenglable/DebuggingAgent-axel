To resolve the described issue, I need to analyze and potentially modify the `MigrationLoader.build_graph` method. Since I'm advised to consider making changes within `MigrationLoader.build_graph`, and since I need the method's source code before generating a patch, I'll search for the `build_graph` method in the `django/db/migrations/loader.py` file.

Here is the corresponding step to retrieve the necessary source code:

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/loader.py", "MigrationLoader.build_graph")
```

To determine whether the issue is fixed, let's analyze the patch, the original output, and the patched output.

**Analysis:**

1. **Original Issue:**
   - The `plt.hist` function was expected to respect the `range=(0, 1)` parameter even when `density=True`. However, the bins did not start at 0 and end at 1 as expected.

2. **Original Output:**
   - The bins were `[0.00226161, 0.19732407, ..., 0.97757391]` when `density=True`, which did not match the expected range.

3. **Patch Explanation:**
   - The patch involves modifying how `hist_kwargs` is initialized by ensuring that the `density` setting is added to the existing `hist_kwargs` dictionary using `hist_kwargs['density'] = density` instead of reassigning it with `dict(density=density)`. This ensures that all pre-existing parameters, including `range`, are preserved when `density=True`.

4. **Patched Output:**
   - The bins after applying the patch are `[0.0, 0.16666667, ..., 1.0]`, which respect the `range=(0, 1)` and match the expected outcome.

**Conclusion:**

The test output after applying the patch shows that the bins now start at 0 and end at 1, respecting the range parameter as intended. Therefore, the issue is fixed.

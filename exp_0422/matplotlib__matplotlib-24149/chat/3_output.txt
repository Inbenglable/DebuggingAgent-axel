Analyzing the provided traceback and the related code execution path, the issue arises when `ax.bar([np.nan], [np.nan])` is executed. The traceback shows the error occurs in `_safe_first_finite` method within `matplotlib.cbook`. 

This function `_safe_first_finite` attempts to retrieve the first finite value from a sequence, which leads to a `StopIteration` exception when the input consists entirely of `NaN` values. 

Let's continue tracing to further evaluate and confirm the method's behavior. 

Observed method: `matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py:_safe_first_finite`

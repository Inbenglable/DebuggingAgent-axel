To resolve the issue with the `trim_docstring` function, I'll prepare a patch in the SEARCH/REPLACE format that skips the first line when calculating the minimum indentation, as suggested in the proposed solution. This modification targets the code in the `django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py` file.

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())\n=======\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

The patch updates the calculation of `indent` to begin from the second line onward, avoiding errors when docstrings start on the first line.

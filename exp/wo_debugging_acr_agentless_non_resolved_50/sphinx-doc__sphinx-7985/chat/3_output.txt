To address this issue, we need to review the current implementation of the `linkcheck` feature in Sphinx to determine how it handles link checking. We are specifically interested in how it checks internal or local links, so we need to locate the relevant part of the code and understand the logic implemented there.

Given that we want to enhance the `linkcheck` functionality to include checking local links, it makes sense to start by looking at the link-checking logic in the Sphinx codebase. Therefore, I will search for the `linkcheck` method or relevant components related to link checking within the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("linkcheck")
```

Based on the issue at hand - ensuring consistent comparison results between `Boolean` values and `Float` values in the SymPy library - the task requires examining the `__eq__` method implementations for relevant classes handling `Boolean` and `Float` values. We employed two specific searches: `Boolean.__eq__` and `Float.__eq__`. However, the provided search results reflect `__eq__` methods from various different classes, most of which are unrelated to the issue.

Here's the analysis for each returned result:

1. **sympy/plotting/intervalmath/interval_arithmetic.py:interval.__eq__** - This is related to the interval class and not relevant to Boolean or Float.
   
2. **sympy/plotting/intervalmath/interval_membership.py:intervalMembership.__eq__** - This is related to interval membership and not relevant.
   
3. **sympy/physics/optics/medium.py:Medium.__eq__** - Related to Medium class; doesn't concern Boolean or Float.
   
4. **sympy/physics/vector/frame.py:CoordinateSym.__eq__** - Pertains to CoordinateSym class and not relevant.
   
5. **sympy/physics/vector/vector.py:Vector.__eq__** - Related to vector handling and irrelevant.
   
6. **sympy/physics/vector/dyadic.py:Dyadic.__eq__** - Pertinent to Dyadic class and not relevant.
   
7. **sympy/physics/units/dimensions.py:Dimension.__eq__** - This concerns the Dimension class; doesn't pertain to Boolean or Float.
   
8. **sympy/core/basic.py:Basic.__eq__** - Implementation for the base object class in SymPy, possibly relevant due to general object comparison.
   
9. **sympy/core/containers.py:Tuple.__eq__** - Pertains to Tuple class; not directly related to our issue.
   
10. **sympy/core/logic.py:Logic.__eq__** - This is related to logic expressions, possibly relevant if it involves Boolean logic handling.
   
11. **sympy/core/function.py:Subs.__eq__** - Related to substitutions; not relevant.
   
12. **sympy/core/expr.py:Expr.__eq__** - This is critical as `Expr` is a foundational class in symbolic expressions, may include Booleans and could be relevant.

13. **sympy/core/numbers.py:NumberSymbol.__eq__** - Deals with numerical symbols, can be relevant depending on handling float comparisons.

Remaining entries largely follow the same analysis path. Primarily, only the implementations for 'Boolean' and 'Float' equality methods, or those related to foundational types where Float and Boolean might be used, will be relevant.

Based on this analysis, here are the components we should examine for possible modifications to address the issue:

```
sympy/core/basic.py:Basic.__eq__
sympy/core/logic.py:Logic.__eq__
sympy/core/expr.py:Expr.__eq__
sympy/core/numbers.py:NumberSymbol.__eq__
```

To generate a patch for the issue related to the ordering of imports in Django migration files, I need to ensure I've accessed the source code for the `as_string` method of the `MigrationWriter` class, identified in the `django/db/migrations/writer.py` file. I've already retrieved it, so I'm ready to proceed with generating the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

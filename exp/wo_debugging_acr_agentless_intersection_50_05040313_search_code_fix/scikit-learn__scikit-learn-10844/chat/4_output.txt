To determine if the issue is fixed, let's analyze the provided information:

## Analysis

### Original Issue
The original line of code in `sklearn/metrics/cluster/supervised.py`:
```python
return tk / np.sqrt(pk * qk) if tk != 0. else 0.
```
causes a `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in long_scalars` due to the multiplication of `pk` and `qk` leading to a value that exceeds the maximum limit for integers.

### Patch
The patch modifies the return statement as follows:
```python
return np.sqrt(tk / pk) * np.sqrt(tk / qk) if tk != 0. else 0.
```
This modification splits the square root calculation to operate directly on `tk / pk` and `tk / qk` individually, thereby reducing the risk of overflow by avoiding the direct multiplication of `pk` and `qk`.

### Test Output Before Patch
The test output prior to patching showed a runtime warning:
```
RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in long_scalars
```

### Test Output After Patch
The patched output shows no runtime warnings.

## Conclusion
The test results after applying the patch indicate that the overflow issue has been resolved. The absence of warnings or errors in the patched output suggests that the modified calculation alleviates the overflow problem that occurred in the original code.

Issue resolved: `True`

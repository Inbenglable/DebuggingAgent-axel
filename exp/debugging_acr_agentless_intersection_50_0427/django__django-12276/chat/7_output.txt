To generate the patch and resolve the issue, I need to review the source code for the `FileInput` class in the `django/forms/widgets.py` file. This would help in understanding how to integrate or modify the `use_required_attribute()` functionality for `FileInput`.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "FileInput")
```

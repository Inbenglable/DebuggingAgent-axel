To address the issue, I need to locate the piece of code responsible for the transformation of structured `np.array` into `NdarrayMixin` within the **astropy** project. The code snippet provided in the issue suggests that this transformation occurs when adding structured arrays to a `Table`. Likely, this is part of the `Table` class or a related utility within **astropy**. Accordingly, I will proceed to search for this logic in the codebase.

```python
search_code_in_codebase("if (not isinstance(data, Column) and not data_is_mixin and isinstance(data, np.ndarray) and len(data.dtype) > 1):")
```

To resolve the issue, we need to modify the code to check for HTTP errors before checking for anchors. Currently, the `check_anchor` method is responsible for verifying the presence of anchors in the HTML content of a response. However, before invoking this function, we need to ensure any HTTP response error is reported correctly. 

Here is the patch to update the file `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py`:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    anchor_found = self.check_anchor(response, anchor)\n=======\n    if response.status_code != 200:\n        self.warn(broken('%s#%s' % (link, anchor),\n                        '%d Client Error: %s for url: %s' % (response.status_code, response.reason, link)))\n        return False\n    anchor_found = self.check_anchor(response, anchor)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This patch adds a check to see if the HTTP response status code is not 200 before attempting to check for the anchor. If there is an error such as 404 or 500, it will log the HTTP error, and the anchor check will be skipped.

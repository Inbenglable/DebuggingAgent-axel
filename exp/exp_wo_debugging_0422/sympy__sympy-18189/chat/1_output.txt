To resolve the issue, I need to examine the implementation of the `diophantine` function. This will allow me to understand how permutations are handled and why the results may differ based on the order of symbols. As I don't know the file location of the `diophantine` function from the provided information, I will search for it in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("diophantine")
```

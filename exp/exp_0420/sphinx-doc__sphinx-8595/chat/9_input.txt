You need to trace the abnormal program to resolve project issues and submit pull requests.
Now you need to reolve the following issue in the **sphinx** project:
#### ISSUE
autodoc: empty __all__ attribute is ignored
**Describe the bug**
autodoc: empty `__all__` attribute is ignored

**To Reproduce**
```
# example.py
__all__ = []


def foo():
    "docstring"


def bar():
    "docstring"


def baz():
    "docstring"
```
```
# index.rst
.. automodule:: example
   :members:
```

All foo, bar, and baz are shown.

**Expected behavior**
No entries should be shown because `__all__` is empty.

**Your project**
No

**Screenshots**
No

**Environment info**
- OS: Mac
- Python version: 3.9.1
- Sphinx version: HEAD of 3.x
- Sphinx extensions: sphinx.ext.autodoc
- Extra tools: No

**Additional context**
No


Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
# conf.py
import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))

project = 'Test'
copyright = '2023'
author = 'Test'

extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc']


doc_source = '''# example.py
__all__ = []

def foo():
    "docstring"

def bar():
    "docstring"

def baz():
    "docstring"
''''

index_source = '''# index.rst
.. automodule:: example
   :members:
''''


# Creating the example.py file
with open('example.py', 'w') as f:
    f.write(doc_source)

# Creating the index.rst file
with open('index.rst', 'w') as f:
    f.write(index_source)

from sphinx.application import Sphinx

# Running the Sphinx build
app = Sphinx(srcdir='.', confdir='.', outdir='_build', doctreedir='_build/doctrees', buildername='html')
app.build()



This is the tracing and analysis history:

==================================================
The error encountered in the testing script (`EOL while scanning string literal (debugging_test.py, line 24)`) indicates that there's a problem with the string literals in the script. Specifically, the string is not terminated properly, causing a syntax error.

Here's the issue in the observed code:
```python
doc_source = '''# example.py
__all__ = []

def foo():
    "docstring"

def bar():
    "docstring"

def baz():
    "docstring"
''''

index_source = '''# index.rst
.. automodule:: example
   :members:
''''
```

The string literals for `doc_source` and `index_source` have been terminated incorrectly.

To fix this, the string literals should be properly enclosed with the correct number of quotes:

```python
doc_source = '''# example.py
__all__ = []

def foo():
    "docstring"

def bar():
    "docstring"

def baz():
    "docstring"
'''

index_source = '''# index.rst
.. automodule:: example
   :members:
'''
```

I will go ahead and make the necessary changes to ensure the strings are properly terminated.

However, this is a fix in the test code and does not address the actual issue reported with the `sphinx` project. We need to identify the root cause of the bug where an empty `__all__` attribute is ignored.

The issue lies in the implementation of `sphinx.ext.autodoc` where it determines which members to include. I suspect it involves checking the `__all__` attribute.

Next, I'll observe the method responsible for identifying and including members in the documentation.

Observed method: `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:get_object_members`
==================================================
The issue reported suggests that when the `__all__` attribute is empty, all members of the module are being included in the documentation. According to the intended behavior, if `__all__` is empty, no members should be included.

From the observations, it appears that the method `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:get_object_members` is responsible for retrieving members of a class for documentation. The specific class documenter method `ClassDocumenter.get_object_members` seems to be where the members are filtered based on options and conditions including the presence of an `__all__` attribute.

The method checks the `want_all` parameter and the `self.options.members` to determine which members to include. To identify whether this method correctly handles the empty `__all__` attribute, we need to further observe how the `want_all` flag and the `self.options` attributes are set and used.

We need to check the code section where `want_all` and `self.options.members` conditions are processed, as an empty `__all__` attribute should lead to no members being selected.


### Next Step:
We need to trace deeper into the conditional logic that processes member inclusion. Specifically, let's observe lines 1627-1638 to see how the `want_all` and `self.options.members` conditions are handled.

```python
Observed scope: sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:1627-1638
```
==================================================
I've analyzed the code snippet within the `ClassDocumenter.get_object_members` method. The logic appears to check the `want_all` flag and the `self.options.members`. If `want_all` is `False` and `self.options.members` is not specified, the method should return no members. However, there is no explicit condition handling an empty `__all__` attribute leading to an empty members list.

Based on the issue, the empty `__all__` attribute means no members should be selected. Since the observed code snippet doesn't account for an empty `__all__` resulting in no members, we need to trace where the `want_all` flag and the `self.options.members` are set and handle empty `__all__`.

Next, I'll observe how the `want_all` flag and the `self.options.members` are set. The setup likely happens earlier in the `ClassDocumenter` class or other related parts of the `autodoc` module where the options parameters are initialized and `__all__` is processed.

### Next Observation:
We need to locate the class initialization of `ClassDocumenter` or relevant parts where `want_all` and `self.options.members` conditions are set or processed.

My next step is to observe `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:ClassDocumenter.__init__`

Observed method: `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:ClassDocumenter.__init__`

Let's proceed with observing this method to further trace the abnormal program behavior.
==================================================


Now you choose downstream method ClassDocumenter.__init__ to further observe, tracing the abnormal program behavior.
This is the method code:
  1438	    def __init__(self, *args: Any) -> None:
  1439	        super().__init__(*args)
  1440	        merge_members_option(self.options)


This is the runtime information of ClassDocumenter.__init__:

You need to trace the abnormal program behavior step by step to identify the root cause of the bug and locate the buggy method that contains the code to be fixed.
Now, please first analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior. 

Then, if you can already locate the buggy method and buggy code, reply with:  
Buggy method: `{FILE_PATH}:{METHOD_NAME}`
Otherwise, continue tracing by telling me the code line scope that you want to deeper observe, we will show you the deeper downstream run-time information of the scope you select. Please reply with:
Observed scope: `{FILE_PATH}:{START_LOC}-{END_LOC}`
Note that {FILE_PATH} refers to the path relative to the repository.

## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Migration import ordering violates coding style and isort defaults
Description
	
New migration files are generated with imports sorted by module, independent of import style. For example:
import datetime
from django.db import migrations, models
import time
The ​Django coding style specifies:
Place all import module statements before from module import objects in each section.
This guidance is the same as what isort does by default, ​as documented here. Newly generated migrations can fail isort for this reason.
This would mean migration files should instead be generated like this:
import datetime
import time
from django.db import migrations, models
For reference, previous issues related to migration import sorting: #24155, #25384.

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue with the incorrect import ordering in Django migration files, it is necessary to review the code responsible for generating these migration files. The problem likely stems from the Django migration framework, possibly contained within the management commands or migration classes.

To proceed, I must search for the code that generates migrations. This involves identifying the relevant part of Django's codebase that handles migration file creation. Likely candidates are within Django's migration modules or files related to management commands.

I'll start by searching for the method used to create migration files, which might be part of Django's migration framework. This involves searching for code related to the migration generation process.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("create_migration")
search_method_in_codebase("write_migration_file")
search_class_in_codebase("MigrationAutodetector")
search_class_in_codebase("MigrationWriter")
```
By reviewing the source code of these methods or classes, I will be able to identify where to adjust the import ordering.

==================================================

Your Output:
Based on the gathered information, I need to focus on the `MigrationWriter` class as it is responsible for producing the contents of migration files. Specifically, I am interested in the `as_string` method, as it likely controls the output format of the migration files, including the import statements.

Let's retrieve the `as_string` method's source code from the `django/db/migrations/writer.py` file to understand how the import ordering is implemented.

search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/writer.py", "MigrationWriter.as_string")

==================================================

Your Output:
I've gathered the necessary code to generate a patch that will fix the import ordering problem in the Django migration files by modifying the `MigrationWriter.as_string` method. 

Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

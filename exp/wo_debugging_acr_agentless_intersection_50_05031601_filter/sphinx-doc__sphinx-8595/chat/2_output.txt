To resolve the issue, I need to inspect the `get_object_members` method in the `Documenter` class, as this is likely where the handling of the `__all__` attribute is managed. This method is crucial because it determines which members of a module are considered for documentation.

Let's retrieve the source code for this method from the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py", "Documenter.get_object_members")
```

Given the information retrieved so far, I need to understand the implementation details of the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass, specifically the `__init__` method and any other methods. This will help identify how `inspect.isfunction` is used and formulate a proper solution to handle properties.

Thus, I need to retrieve the full source code of the `InheritDocstrings` class from `astropy/utils/misc.py`.

```python
search_class_in_file("astropy/utils/misc.py", "InheritDocstrings")
```

To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code for the `__eq__` method in the `sympy/logic/boolalg.py` file since the `BooleanAtom` class is located there. By analyzing this method, I will understand how equality is currently handled for Boolean atoms and devise a way to modify it for the correct behavior when comparing `S.false` and numeric zero representations like `S(0.0)`.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/logic/boolalg.py", "BooleanAtom.__eq__")
```

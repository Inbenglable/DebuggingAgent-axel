To resolve the issue related to `method_decorator` not preserving wrapper assignments which results in missing function attributes, we need to inspect the source code of the `method_decorator` function in the Django project. The aim is to ensure that the `@wraps` decorator, which is part of Python's standard library (`functools`), is correctly applied to maintain these attributes.

I need to retrieve the source code of the `method_decorator` function to modify its implementation to correctly utilize `functools.wraps`. I will search for the `method_decorator` function's source code within the Django codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("method_decorator")
```

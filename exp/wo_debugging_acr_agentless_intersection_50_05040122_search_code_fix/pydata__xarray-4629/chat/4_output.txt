To determine whether the issue is resolved, let's review the patch and compare the test output before and after applying the patch.

### Patch Review:
The patch modifies the `xarray/core/merge.py` file by changing the line:
```python
return variable_attrs[0]
```
to:
```python
return dict(variable_attrs[0])
```
This change ensures that a new dictionary is returned, which is a copy of the first element's attributes rather than a reference to it. This should prevent modifications to the merged dataset's attributes from affecting the original dataset's attributes.

### Test Output Analysis:

#### Original Output:
Before applying the patch, the test failed with an `AssertionError`, indicating that the attribute `'a'` in `xds1` was unexpectedly changed after modifying `xds3`.

#### Patched Output:
After applying the patch, the test output is empty, which means no assertions were raised, and the test passed successfully. This indicates that the attributes of `xds1` remained unchanged after modifying `xds3`.

### Conclusion:
The patch correctly addresses the issue by ensuring that a copy of the attributes is returned instead of a reference. This prevents modifications to the merged dataset's attributes from affecting the original datasets. The successful passing of the test after applying the patch confirms that the issue is resolved.

Issue resolved: `True`

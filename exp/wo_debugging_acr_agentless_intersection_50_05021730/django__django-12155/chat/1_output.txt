Based on the issue description, the code responsible is the `trim_docstring` function. To address the issue, I'd need to search for the source code of this method to understand its current implementation and make necessary adjustments.

Since the issue suggests modifying the logic of the `indent` calculation in the `trim_docstring` function, I need to locate and retrieve the source code for this method first.

Let's proceed with searching for the method in the Django codebase:

```python
search_method_in_codebase("trim_docstring")
```

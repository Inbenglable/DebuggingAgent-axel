Let's break down the steps to evaluate whether the issue is resolved:

1. **Review the Issue Description:**
   - The issue is that `admindoc` fails when the docstring is not prefixed with an empty line. This occurs due to the line calculating indentation in the `trim_docstring` function. The proposed fix is to skip the first line when calculating the minimum indentation.

2. **Review the Test Script:**
   - The test script attempts to reproduce the issue by using a test function with a non-empty first line in the docstring. It then processes the docstring and tries to convert it to HTML with `docutils` which triggers an error if the issue is not fixed.

3. **Reviewing Original Output:**
   - The original output of the test shows a failure due to an `ImportError` when trying to import `simplify_exception`.

4. **Review the Patch Context:**
   - The patch correctly updates the line in `trim_docstring` function to exclude the first line when calculating the minimum indentation.

5. **Review Patched Output:**
   - The patched output is identical to the original output: the test is failing due to `ImportError: cannot import name 'simplify_exception'`.

**Analysis:**
- The actual error reported in both the original and patched output is related to an `ImportError`, which is separate from the issue described. The test script itself cannot progress beyond this error, indicating that it hasn't effectively tested whether the issue in processing docstrings with non-empty first lines is fixed.
- Since neither the original nor the patched output provides information on the core issue described in the bug report, the effectiveness of the patch cannot be evaluated from the test as it stands.

**Conclusion:**
- The test is not able to determine if the patch resolves the issue because the error occurs at a different point (ImportError), unrelated to the functionality being tested.

Issue resolved: `False`

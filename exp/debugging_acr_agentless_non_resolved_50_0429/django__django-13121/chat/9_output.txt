To effectively address the reported issue, I need to gather additional information about the handling of duration expressions specifically in the SQLite and MySQL backends as these are the databases where the issue surfaces. I've already seen the `convert_durationfield_value` method, but I need more information on how durations might be defined or processed at the database level for these specific engines.

I will proceed with the following actions to get the required code regarding duration handling in SQLite and MySQL:

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py", "convert_durationfield_value")
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/mysql/base.py", "convert_durationfield_value")
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/sqlite3/operations.py", "def alter_sqlite_duration_expr")
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/mysql/operations.py", "def alter_mysql_duration_expr")
```

This should give insight into how durations are being modified or handled in these specific databases, helping produce a more accurate fix.

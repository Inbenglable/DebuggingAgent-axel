To address the issue mentioned, I need to examine the source code of the `_create_unique_sql` method. This is necessary to understand how the `references_column` is being set incorrectly. Based on the issue description, it seems like a `Table` instance is passed instead of a string.

I will search for the `_create_unique_sql` method in the codebase to identify its definition.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("_create_unique_sql")
```

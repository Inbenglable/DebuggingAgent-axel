To address the issue with the `bulk_create` method in Django not correctly using `db_column` names in the SQL "ON CONFLICT" clause, I need to examine the source code of the `bulk_create` method. This will help me understand how column names are being fetched and utilized in constructing the SQL statement. Since Django's `bulk_create` method might be part of the QuerySet class, I'll start searching for the `bulk_create` method in the Django codebase:

```python
search_method_in_codebase("QuerySet.bulk_create")
```

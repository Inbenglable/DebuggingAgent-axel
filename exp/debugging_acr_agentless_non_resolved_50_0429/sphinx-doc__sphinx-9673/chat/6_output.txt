Based on the analysis of the observed code snippet within `Sphinx.__init__`, the method `setup_extension` is responsible for setting up various extensions, including the `autodoc` and `napoleon` extensions. However, it seems that the extensions themselves or their handling of configurations are not directly causing the issue.

The abnormal behavior suggests that the integration with `napoleon` is somehow not processing the return type information as documented. To locate the issue, we need to trace the processing of function docstrings, especially focusing on the interaction between `autodoc_typehints_description_target` and google-style docstring parsing.

Next, I will observe the method where Sphinx handles autodoc type hints and integrates them with Napoleon, specifically where it affects the generation of rtype or return type sections within the documentation.

Observed method: `sphinx.ext.autodoc.Documenter.add_content`

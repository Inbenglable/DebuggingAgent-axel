## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
Add transaction handling to Changelist list_editable processing.
Description
	
It seems that changelist_view in Django admin is missing a transaction. Since the view may change data in database, it should be wrapped in a transaction to prevent unexpected states in case of errors.

</ISSUE>


In the previous round, you called search APIs to retrieve relevant source code that would help identify the root cause of the issue and generate a patch. However, the code you retrieved appears in multiple locations (maybe some are irrelevant but have same key). So now your task is to determine which of the retrieved contents are indeed you need, and filter out the irrelevant ones.
This is your API invocation round output:
The issue at hand is to ensure that the `changelist_view` in Django's admin is wrapped in a database transaction to maintain data consistency in case of errors during processing.

To resolve this issue, I'll need to locate the `changelist_view` method in the Django codebase, specifically within the admin's view handling code, and verify how to wrap its database operations in a transaction. Since specific file paths or class names were not provided in the issue, I'll need to search for the `changelist_view` method in the Django admin module.

Let's begin by retrieving the source code for the `changelist_view` method. 

```python
search_method_in_codebase("changelist_view")
```

And this is the corresponding API returned result (each content is started with #### FILE_PATH:NAME):
Your API invoke result:

Among the API returned contents, there may be some irrelevant ones or not. So now you need to analyze each returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.
Now, please first analyze the API returned content and determine whether each one is your needed.

Then you need to choose you needed ones with the following format:
```
FILE_PATH_1:NAME_1
FILE_PATH_2:NAME_2
...
```

Note:
1. The value of FILE_PATH:NAME, must consistent with the API returned content (but remove the prefix ####).
2. You may select one or more contents, or even all of them if they are indeed you need.

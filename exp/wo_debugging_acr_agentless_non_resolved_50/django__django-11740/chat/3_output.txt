To resolve the issue, I need to gather more information about how dependencies are created in migrations, especially concerning ForeignKey relationships. Although I have found the `Migration` class definition, I don't have detailed insights into how dependencies are specifically handled when a ForeignKey is added.

I need to look into the migration operations, particularly the `AddField` or related operations that deal with dependencies. This requires searching for the methods involved in handling dependencies related to ForeignKey fields.

I'll search for the `AddField` operation or similar methods in the Django codebase that would likely interact with the `Migration` class to add dependencies when fields are altered.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("AddField")
search_method_in_codebase("AlterField")
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/migration.py", "Migration.apply")
search_method_in_file("django/db/migrations/migration.py", "Migration.mutate_state")
```

I need to examine the full implementation of `pytest_runtest_call` in `src/_pytest/skipping.py` as it deals with the core logic related to running test calls and handling skipped tests. Since we focus on addressing the issue where `unittest.TestCase` marked with `unittest.skip` still invokes `tearDown()` when using `--pdb`, it's essential to understand how `pytest` distinguishes such tests during execution, particularly with pdb enabled.

```python
search_method_in_file("src/_pytest/runner.py", "pytest_runtest_call")
search_code_in_file("src/_pytest/runner.py", "pdb")
search_code_in_file("src/_pytest/main.py", "wrap_session")
```

To determine whether the issue is resolved or not, let's review the patch and examine the test outputs before and after applying the patch.

### Patch Review

The patch introduces `allow_distinct = True` for the `Avg` and `Sum` aggregate classes:

```python
### django/db/models/aggregates.py
class Avg(FixDurationInputMixin, NumericOutputFieldMixin, Aggregate):
    allow_distinct = True
```

```python
### django/db/models/aggregates.py
class Sum(FixDurationInputMixin, Aggregate):
    allow_distinct = True
```

These changes appear to directly address the issue by allowing DISTINCT to be utilized with the Avg and Sum aggregate functions.

### Test Output Analysis

#### Original Output

Before applying the patch, the test resulted in an exception:

```
django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet.
```

This exception indicates a setup issue within the test environment, specifically that the application's registry wasn't correctly initialized. This error would prevent the test from reaching the specific point where it evaluates whether the aggregates allow DISTINCT.

#### Patched Output

The output after applying the patch is identical to the original:

```
django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet.
```

This suggests the patch did not influence the problem leading to the same test environment error. Therefore, it is impossible to ascertain whether the issue regarding DISTINCT support for Avg and Sum was resolved, as the test didn't proceed past setup.

### Conclusion

Given the unchanged test output, which does not allow us to evaluate the DISTINCT handling within the aggregates due to the setup error (`AppRegistryNotReady`), it remains unclear if the underlying issue was resolved through the patch. The resolution of the bug requires a working test environment to verify DISTINCT handling in Avg and Sum aggregates successfully.

Issue resolved: `False`

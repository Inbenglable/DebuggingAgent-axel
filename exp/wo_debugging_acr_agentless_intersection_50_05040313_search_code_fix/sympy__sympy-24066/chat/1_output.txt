To address the issue in the `sympy` project, I need to examine the source code of the `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension` method. This is necessary to understand why it cannot properly detect that the exponent is dimensionless. I'll begin by locating the method in the codebase to identify how it's implemented.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("SI._collect_factor_and_dimension")
```

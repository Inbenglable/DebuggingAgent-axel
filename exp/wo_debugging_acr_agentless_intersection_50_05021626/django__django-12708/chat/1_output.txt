To address the issue, I need to inspect the source code of the `_delete_composed_index` method where the error occurs. This will help me understand the code further so I can generate an appropriate patch.

I'll start by searching for this method in the `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/base/schema.py", "_delete_composed_index")
```

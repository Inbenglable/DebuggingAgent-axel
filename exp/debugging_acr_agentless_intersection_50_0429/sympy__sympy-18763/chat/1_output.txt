The issue at hand relates to the incorrect parenthesizing in the LaTeX representation of `Subs` expressions. Specifically, when multiplying by a constant, the expression inside the `Subs` should be enclosed in parentheses to ensure proper formatting in LaTeX.

From the stack trace and test execution, it is clear that the discrepancy arises during the LaTeX rendering of the `Subs` expression. The relevant function responsible for LaTeX generation is in the `sympy/printing/latex.py` file. This function needs to ensure that the expression inside `Subs` is correctly parenthesized when necessary.

Given the observation, we should trace further into the LaTeX generation to understand how the current format is produced and where the lack of parentheses handling is failing. The function processing the `Subs` expressions should be part of the LaTeXPrinter class or a related function that generates LaTeX strings for expressions.

Observed method: `sympy/printing/latex.py:LatexPrinter._print_Subs`

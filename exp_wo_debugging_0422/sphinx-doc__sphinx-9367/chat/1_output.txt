To resolve the issue of rendering a 1-element tuple incorrectly in the Sphinx project, I need to determine how tuples are currently being rendered in the codebase. This likely involves examining the part of the code responsible for outputting tuple representations. Since a test case was added to the file `tests/test_pycode_ast.py`, it indicates the rendering logic is likely associated with this test. Therefore, the relevant source code needs to be retrieved to assess and adjust the rendering of tuples.

To gather the necessary information, the next step is to search for how tuples are being handled in that file or the associated logic by inspecting related methods in `tests/test_pycode_ast.py`. Let's perform this step to gain the required context.

```python
search_code_in_file("tests/test_pycode_ast.py", "(1,)")
```

Upon reviewing the patch and analyzing the test outputs, here is what I found:

### Patch Details:
The patch modifies the behavior of Sphinx's `:private-members:` option in the `autodoc` extension. It allows the option to specify exactly which private members should be documented, whereas previously it would document all private members indiscriminately.

### Test Output Analysis:

#### Before Applying the Patch:
- The test failed to find the specific functionality for the `:private-members:` option in the HTML output. It included all private members (`_private_function`, `_PrivateClass`, and `_private_method`), rather than just the specified `_private_function`.

#### After Applying the Patch:
- The main change is that the test is supposed to restrict documentation to only the specified `_private_function`.
- However, upon review of the patched output, the test still experiences the same failure as before: the `_build/html/index.html` file is not found, indicating that the specific functionality still does not work as intended.

### Conclusion:
The issue has not been resolved after applying the patch. The output and behavior remain unchanged, failing to filter and document only the specified private member.

Issue resolved: `False`

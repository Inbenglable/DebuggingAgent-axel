The issue involves the `CountVectorizer` class in the `scikit-learn` library, specifically dealing with the `get_feature_names` method when the `vocabulary` parameter is provided but the vectorizer hasn't been fitted. The proposed solution suggests that `get_feature_names` should not raise `NotFittedError` if `vocabulary` is supplied, but `vocabulary_` is not yet set.

To generate a patch, I need to examine:
1. The `get_feature_names` method in `CountVectorizer` class.
2. The location where `_validate_vocabulary` method is called to set the `vocabulary_`.

The first step is to locate and retrieve the source code for the `CountVectorizer.get_feature_names` method.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("CountVectorizer.get_feature_names")
```

Given the analysis and observations, I need to retrieve the source code of the `PreparedRequest.prepare_headers` method from the `requests/models.py` file to proceed with generating the patch. 

I'll use the API to search for this method:

```python
search_method_in_file("requests/models.py", "PreparedRequest.prepare_headers")
```

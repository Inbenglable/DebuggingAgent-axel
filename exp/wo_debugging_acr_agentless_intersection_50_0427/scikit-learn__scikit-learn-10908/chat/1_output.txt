To resolve the issue at hand, we need to examine the `CountVectorizer` class implementation, specifically focusing on the `get_feature_names` method and the logic related to handling the `vocabulary` parameter. As this class is a part of the `scikit-learn` library, the relevant source files will need to be searched to inspect how these components are implemented and how they interact.

First, I will search for the `CountVectorizer` class to locate the file and then focus on the `get_feature_names` method within that class.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("CountVectorizer")
search_method_in_file("sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py", "get_feature_names")
```

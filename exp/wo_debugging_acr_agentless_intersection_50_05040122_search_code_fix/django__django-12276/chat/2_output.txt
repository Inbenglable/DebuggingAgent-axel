Since I've obtained the source code for the `ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute` method and seen its current logic, but there is no `FileInput.use_required_attribute` implementation available (which is likely needed since the suggestion is to move the logic there), I'll search for the `FileInput` class source code. This will help me understand where to implement the new method.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "FileInput")
```

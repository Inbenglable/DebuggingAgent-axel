To generate the patch, I need to ensure that I accurately introduce the `__iter__` method within the `Paginator` class found in `django/core/paginator.py`. Therefore, I will retrieve the full source code of the `Paginator` class to correctly place the new method.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/core/paginator.py", "Paginator")
```

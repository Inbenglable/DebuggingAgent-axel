## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
units.quantity_input decorator fails for constructors with type hinted return value -> None
### Summary
I am using the `units.quantity_input` decorator with typing hints for constructors, however when I add the correct return value for the constructor (`None`) then I get an exception, because `None` has no attribute `to`.

### Reproducer
The issue can be reproduced with the following file:
``` Python
import astropy.units as u


class PoC(object):

    @u.quantity_input
    def __init__(self, voltage: u.V) -> None:
        pass


if __name__ == '__main__':
    poc = PoC(1.*u.V)
```
which results in the following error:
```
$ python3 poc.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "poc.py", line 12, in <module>
    poc = PoC(1.*u.V)
  File "/usr/lib64/python3.6/site-packages/astropy/utils/decorators.py", line 868, in __init__
    func = make_function_with_signature(func, name=name, **wrapped_args)
  File "/usr/lib64/python3.6/site-packages/astropy/units/decorators.py", line 225, in wrapper
    return return_.to(wrapped_signature.return_annotation)
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'to'
```

This has been tested on Fedora 27 with python 3.6.3, astropy 2.0.2 and numpy 1.13.3 all from Fedora's repository.

### Workaround
The issue can be circumvented by not adding the return type typing hint. Unfortunately, then a static type checker cannot infer that this function returns nothing.

### Possible fix
Maybe the decorator could explicitly check whether None is returned and then omit the unit check.

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue with the `units.quantity_input` decorator when a return type of `None` is specified, we need to understand how the `quantity_input` decorator processes return values. Specifically, we should investigate how it attempts to handle return value unit conversions and type annotations within the `decorators.py` file.

Let's proceed by checking the specific method or part in the `astropy/units/decorators.py` file that is responsible for applying this decorator and handling the return type. Based on the error message, the likely location of the issue involves the use of `return_.to(...)`.

Therefore, I will first search for the relevant function within the `decorators.py` file where this operation is performed.

```python
search_code_in_file("astropy/units/decorators.py", "return_.to(wrapped_signature.return_annotation)")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_code_in_file("astropy/units/decorators.py", "return_.to(wrapped_signature.return_annotation)")
RESULT:
#### astropy/units/decorators.py:221-227
```python
            with add_enabled_equivalencies(self.equivalencies):
                return_ = wrapped_function(*func_args, **func_kwargs)
            if wrapped_signature.return_annotation is not inspect.Signature.empty:
                return return_.to(wrapped_signature.return_annotation)
            else:
                return return_

```


==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

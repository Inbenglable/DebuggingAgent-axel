To address the issue, we need to set a default value for `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` in the Django settings file. This will ensure that, when not explicitly configured, newly uploaded files will have consistent permissions of `0o644` by default.

Here are the edits needed in the code:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/conf/global_settings.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nFILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None\n=======\nFILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = 0o644\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This change will set the default `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` to `0o644` if it is not specified elsewhere in the configuration. This ensures that files uploaded via the `FileSystemStorage` will have the desired default permissions.

To address the issue with the `units.quantity_input` decorator failing for constructors with a type-hinted return value of `None`, I need to examine the implementation of the `quantity_input` decorator and the `wrapper` function within the Astropy source code.

To proceed, I will search for the `quantity_input` method and the `wrapper` function in the Astropy codebase to understand how return annotations are processed and where the failure occurs.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("quantity_input")
search_code_in_file("astropy/units/decorators.py", "def wrapper")
```

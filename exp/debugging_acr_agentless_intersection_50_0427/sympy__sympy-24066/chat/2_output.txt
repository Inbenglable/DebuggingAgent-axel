Let's analyze the current observed code and the abnormal program behavior:

The function `_collect_factor_and_dimension()` in the `UnitSystem` is designed to calculate the scale factor and dimension for a given expression. The key issue appears in the handling of expressions involving functions, specifically the exponential function.

From the given runtime trace, we see the following:
1. The input expression is `exp(second/(farad*ohm))`. Ideally, this should be dimensionless because `exp()` should eliminate any dimensions.
2. The method currently does not treat `dim ** exp_dim` as dimensionless if `exp_dim` is dimensionless, despite the logic in handling dimensions in powers (lines 167-172). 
3. Critical observation: In the scope where the expression is of type `Function` (lines 192-196), it appears that there's a lack of proper handling for expressions that should result in dimensionless outcomes like `exp()`.

Therefore, the likely buggy section involves how functions are treated, particularly expressions resulting from `exp()`. Observing how dimensions are handled for expressions of type `Function` would be key.

Since the problem seems related to the dimensional analysis part of the program specifically dealing with functions, let's go deeper into the `Function` block (lines 192-196) to verify the handling and identify any shortcomings.

Based on the information retrieved, the `_print_Function` method currently uses a default handling approach for functions by constructing expression names with string `[args]`. To specifically handle `Max` and ensure that its arguments are correctly positioned in Mathematica syntax (using square brackets), we might need to introduce or adjust existing handling within `_print_Function`.

I will search if there exists a `_print_Max` method to handle the `Max` function separately. Since the name was not found, it's possible that changes need to be introduced in the `_print_Function` method for handling `Max`.

Therefore, I will search for how `known_functions` is defined or used within `MCodePrinter`. This is crucial because `known_functions` seems to act as a dictionary that maps function names to their corresponding Mathematica format.

```python
search_code_in_file("sympy/printing/mathematica.py", "known_functions")
```

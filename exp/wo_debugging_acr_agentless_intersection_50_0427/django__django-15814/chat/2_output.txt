To create the patch, I need to find the broader context of the code where the identified snippet is located, especially to see how `opts = cur_model._meta` is used in the method or class. I'll search for the method in the file `django/db/models/sql/query.py` that contains this piece of code to understand its complete logic.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/sql/query.py", "get_related_populators")
```

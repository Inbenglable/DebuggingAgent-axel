The test output before and after the patch application shows that the test is still failing with the same `AssertionError`. This indicates that the inertia mismatch between `n_jobs=1` and `n_jobs=2` still occurs. Therefore, the issue is not fixed, as the expected results have not been achieved.

Issue resolved: `False`

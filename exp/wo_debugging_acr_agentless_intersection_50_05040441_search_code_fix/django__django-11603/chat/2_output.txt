To address the issue at hand, we need to modify the `Avg` and `Sum` classes to support the DISTINCT parameter for aggregation functions. 

I've identified the classes involved, and they are located in `django/db/models/aggregates.py`. We should ensure these classes allow for the DISTINCT keyword to be used in aggregation. To do this, we'll likely need to define and handle a distinct parameter in these classes.

I need to retrieve the full source code for the `Avg` and `Sum` classes to determine precisely where to implement DISTINCT support. Here's how I will proceed:

```python
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Avg")
search_class_in_file("django/db/models/aggregates.py", "Sum")
```

You are a PR reviewer that needs to review the patch generated by a bug repair agent and determine whether the issue is fixed or not.
This is the bug issue, which is in the **scikit-learn** project:
## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
CountVectorizer's get_feature_names raise not NotFittedError when the vocabulary parameter is provided
If you initialize a `CounterVectorizer` and try to perform a transformation without training you will get a `NotFittedError` exception.

```python
In [1]: from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
In [2]: vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
In [3]: corpus = [
    ...:     'This is the first document.',
    ...:     'This is the second second document.',
    ...:     'And the third one.',
    ...:     'Is this the first document?',
    ...: ]

In [4]: vectorizer.transform(corpus)
NotFittedError: CountVectorizer - Vocabulary wasn't fitted.
```
On the other hand if you provide the `vocabulary` at the initialization of the vectorizer you could transform a corpus without a prior training, right?

```python
In [1]: from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

In [2]: vectorizer = CountVectorizer()

In [3]: corpus = [
    ...:     'This is the first document.',
    ...:     'This is the second second document.',
    ...:     'And the third one.',
    ...:     'Is this the first document?',
    ...: ]

In [4]: vocabulary = ['and', 'document', 'first', 'is', 'one', 'second', 'the', 'third', 'this']

In [5]: vectorizer = CountVectorizer(vocabulary=vocabulary)

In [6]: hasattr(vectorizer, "vocabulary_")
Out[6]: False

In [7]: vectorizer.get_feature_names()
NotFittedError: CountVectorizer - Vocabulary wasn't fitted.

In [8]: vectorizer.transform(corpus)
Out[8]:
<4x9 sparse matrix of type '<class 'numpy.int64'>'
        with 19 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Row format>

In [9]: hasattr(vectorizer, "vocabulary_")
Out[9]: True
```

The `CountVectorizer`'s `transform` calls `_validate_vocabulary` method which sets the `vocabulary_` instance variable.

In the same manner I believe that the `get_feature_names` method should not raise `NotFittedError` if the vocabulary parameter is provided but the vectorizer has not been trained.

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
## REPRODUCE TEST
```
import traceback
import sys
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    corpus = [
        'This is the first document.',
        'This is the second second document.',
        'And the third one.',
        'Is this the first document?',
    ]
    vocabulary = ['and', 'document', 'first', 'is', 'one', 'second', 'the', 'third', 'this']
    
    vectorizer = CountVectorizer(vocabulary=vocabulary)
    
    try:
        # This should not raise an error as per the expectation, but it does
        feature_names = vectorizer.get_feature_names()
        print("Feature names:", feature_names)
        # If the above line does not raise an error, the issue is fixed
        print("The issue is fixed.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "get_feature_names() raised an exception when it should not have"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

And this is the original output when running the test (before applying the patch):
## ORIGINAL OUTPUT

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

```

The repair agent has tried to generate a patch to fix the issue:
## PATCH CONTEXT
<PATCH_CONTEXT>
To resolve the issue where the `get_feature_names` method in `CountVectorizer` raises a `NotFittedError` when a vocabulary is provided directly, we need to adjust the logic in the `_check_vocabulary` method call within `get_feature_names`. Specifically, we need to allow `get_feature_names` to function correctly when a fixed vocabulary has been set (by checking if `vocabulary_` is present).

Here's the patch in the *SEARCH/REPLACE* format:

```pythony
### sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self._check_vocabulary()
=======
        if not hasattr(self, 'vocabulary_'):
            self._validate_vocabulary()
        self._check_vocabulary()
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This patch modifies the `get_feature_names` method to ensure the vocabulary is validated and set if it hasn't been previously established, before calling `_check_vocabulary`. This allows it to work correctly when a vocabulary is provided but not explicitly fitted.

Let's provide this in the JSON format:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        self._check_vocabulary()\n=======\n        if not hasattr(self, 'vocabulary_'):\n            self._validate_vocabulary()\n        self._check_vocabulary()\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```
</PATCH_CONTEXT>

After applying the patch, the output of the test is:
## PATCHED OUTPUT
```
Feature names: ['and', 'document', 'first', 'is', 'one', 'second', 'the', 'third', 'this']
The issue is fixed.

```

Now, please first review the patch and analyse the test output before and after the patch, to determine whether the issue is fixed or not.

And finally, tell me whether the issue is fixed or not by replying with:
Issue resolved: `True/False`

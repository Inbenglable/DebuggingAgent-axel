To identify the relevant source code, I need to find the sections where the LaTeX printing method specifically relates to the `Subs` functionality or SymPy core functionalities directly associated with expressions handling LaTeX printing. Let's analyze each entry from the API response:

1. **sympy/physics/secondquant.py:PermutationOperator._latex**  
   Not related to `Subs`.

2. **sympy/physics/vector/vector.py:Vector._latex**  
   This pertains to vectors, not `Subs`.

3. **sympy/physics/vector/dyadic.py:Dyadic._latex**  
   This is about dyadics, not `Subs`.

4. **sympy/physics/quantum/tensorproduct.py:TensorProduct._latex**  
   Concerns tensor products, not `Subs`.

5. **sympy/physics/quantum/state.py:StateBase._latex**  
   Deals with quantum states, unrelated to `Subs`.

6. **sympy/physics/quantum/qexpr.py:QExpr._latex**  
   Pertains to quantum expressions, not `Subs`.

7. **sympy/physics/quantum/innerproduct.py:InnerProduct._latex**  
   This is about inner products, not `Subs`.

8. **sympy/physics/quantum/cg.py:Wigner9j._latex**  
   Unrelated to `Subs`.

9. **sympy/physics/quantum/anticommutator.py:AntiCommutator._latex**  
   Pertains to anticommutators, not `Subs`.

10. **sympy/physics/quantum/gate.py:CNotGate._latex**  
    This is about quantum gates, not `Subs`.

11. **sympy/physics/quantum/hilbert.py:TensorPowerHilbertSpace._latex**  
    Deals with Hilbert spaces, unrelated to `Subs`.

12. **sympy/physics/quantum/operator.py:OuterProduct._latex**  
    Pertains to outer products, not `Subs`.

13. **sympy/physics/quantum/spin.py:WignerD._latex**  
    Unrelated to `Subs`.

14. **sympy/physics/quantum/commutator.py:Commutator._latex**  
    Relates to commutators, not `Subs`.

15. **sympy/physics/quantum/constants.py:HBar._latex**  
    Pertains to the constant \( \hbar \), not `Subs`.

16. **sympy/physics/units/quantities.py:Quantity._latex**  
    Pertains to quantities, not `Subs`.

17. **sympy/core/numbers.py:ImaginaryUnit._latex**  
    This is closer to core functionalities, potentially related to `Subs`.

18. **sympy/diffgeom/diffgeom.py:CovarDerivativeOp._latex**  
    Relates to differential geometry, not `Subs`.

19. **sympy/vector/scalar.py:BaseScalar._latex**  
    Pertains to scalars, not `Subs`.

20. **sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py:adjoint._latex**  
    Relates to adjoint functions, not `Subs`.

21. **sympy/printing/tableform.py:TableForm._latex**  
    Relates to table forms, not `Subs`.

22. **sympy/sets/setexpr.py:SetExpr._latex**  
    Relates to set expressions, not `Subs`.

None of the entries found explicitly relate to the `Subs` functionality, most are contextual to other Python constructs or domain-specific applications. Thus, it appears that the relevant function `_print_Subs` should be within the sympy core or its specific printing module.

Therefore, the existing search didn't return relevant results specific to the issue described. I recommend searching further within the core SymPy library files like `latex.py` or related files in a subsequent round using different queries focusing on printing and subs functionalities.

I need to retrieve the source code of the `partitions` method in the `sympy` project to better understand how the output dictionaries are currently being reused. This will help in generating an appropriate patch to resolve the issue. Since I don't know which file contains the method, I'll search for it in the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("partitions")
```

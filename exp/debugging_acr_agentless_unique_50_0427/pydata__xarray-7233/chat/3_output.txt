Let's analyze the observed code from the `Coarsen.construct` method and the abnormal program behavior:

### Code Analysis
The key section of the code is how variables are reshaped, followed by determining and setting coordinates:
- The loop iterates over `obj.variables.items()`. Each variable's dimensions are reshaped using dimensions obtained from `window_dim`.
- `should_be_coords` is defined as the intersection of coordinate names in `window_dim` and existing coordinates in `self.obj.coords`. Only coordinates that are dimensions get preserved.
- The `day` is not part of `window_dim`, leading to its exclusion as a coordinate from `should_be_coords`, causing it to be demoted to a variable.

### Abnormal Program Behavior
The failure in maintaining 'day' as a coordinate indicates that the logic in reshaping and coordinate setting isn't handling non-dimensional coordinates correctly.

### Next Steps
The method responsible for constructing the coarsened dataset is the `Coarsen.construct`. However, fixing the issue seems to require incorporating logic to preserve non-dimensional coordinates, which might not be limited to the initially observed lines.

Given that `construct` is directly involved in setting coordinates, understanding more about how non-dimensional coordinates are treated within `construct` will help identify the root cause.

Since the primary focus remains on `construct`, further examination within this method is necessary for a deeper understanding of the dimensions and coordinate transformations.

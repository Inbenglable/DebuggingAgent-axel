Based on the context provided, it seems the `NoNorm.__call__` method is being invoked multiple times, returning `value` without modification, indicating that this may not be the site directly responsible for handling `uint8` overflows.

To identify the problematic region dealing with `uint8` conversions, I need to search the specific lines in `matplotlib/colors.py` around 720-740 that were mentioned in the issue description, possibly correlating to `_BaseColorMap.__call__`. Therefore, I will retrieve source code around these lines to locate operations interacting with `uint8`.

```python
search_code_in_file("lib/matplotlib/colors.py", "xa[xa > self.N - 1] = self._i_over")
search_code_in_file("lib/matplotlib/colors.py", "xa[xa < 0] = self._i_under")
search_code_in_file("lib/matplotlib/colors.py", "xa[mask_bad] = self._i_bad")
```

The error occurs because the `combine_by_coords()` method checks for monotonicity of coordinates, and raises a `ValueError` if any coordinate dimension is not monotonic, even if it is identical across datasets. According to the issue description, identical coordinates should be ignored as per the documentation.

To tackle this problem, we should investigate how the method decides monotonicity and potentially adjust the condition to allow non-monotonic identical coordinates.

To properly understand and fix this issue, we need to trace the logic that governs monotonicity checks, especially between lines 502 and 511 in the `combine_by_coords` method.

Let's proceed to observe the code within this scope for deeper tracing to identify more specifics of its behavior.

Observed scope: `xarray/core/combine.py:502-511`

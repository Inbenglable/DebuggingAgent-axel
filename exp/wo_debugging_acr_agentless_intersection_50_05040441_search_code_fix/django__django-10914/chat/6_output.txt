Upon reviewing the patch and analyzing the test output before and after applying the patch, we can determine the impact and effectiveness of the fix.

### Patch Analysis:
The patch modifies the `_save` method in the `FileSystemStorage` class. It changes the logic for setting file permissions:
- **Before the patch:** Permissions are set using `self.file_permissions_mode` if it's not `None`.
- **After the patch:** If `self.file_permissions_mode` is `None`, it defaults to `0o644`.

### Test Output Analysis:
- **Original Output:** The file permissions for a `TemporaryUploadedFile` were `0o600`, leading to an `AssertionError` since the expected permissions were `0o644`.
- **Patched Output:** After applying the patch, the expected permissions `0o644` are now correctly applied for both `InMemoryUploadedFile` and `TemporaryUploadedFile`. The test message indicates "File permissions are as expected (0o644). Issue is fixed."

The `FileNotFoundError` is unrelated to the permission change and appears to be a cleanup issue with temporary files, which does not affect the correctness of the permissions implementation.

### Conclusion:
The patch successfully resolved the permission inconsistency issue between different types of uploaded files by ensuring a default permission of `0o644`. This resolves the issue as described in the original bug report.

**Issue resolved: `True`**

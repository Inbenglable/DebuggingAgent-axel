The provided patch attempts to fix the issue by modifying the computation of the separability matrix, particularly to handle nested compound models. The goal is to ensure that the separability of nested models is computed correctly by adjusting matrices' dimensions according to the hierarchy.

### Analysis of the Patch and Outputs:

1. **Original Output:**
   - The test fails because the actual separability matrix does not match the expected output. An `AssertionError` is raised indicating a mismatch.

2. **Patch Changes:**
   - The patch modifies the way separability matrices are combined for compound models. Specifically, it creates `left_matrix` and `right_matrix` with padded dimensions to align with the overall model structure.

3. **Patched Output:**
   - After applying the patch, the test results in a `ValueError`. This indicates that the shapes of the matrices involved in the assertion do not match. Specifically, there is an issue with operands not being broadcast together due to mismatched shapes: `(4,8)` and `(4,4)`.

### Conclusion:
The patched output shows a `ValueError` due to the shapes of matrices being incompatible for broadcasting in the assertion check. This indicates that the patch introduces a further issue, likely related to incorrect adjustment or creation of separability matrices, resulting in mismatched dimensions.

Therefore, the issue is not resolved by the patch as the code still does not yield the expected behavior, and the test fails with a new error type.

**Issue resolved: `False`**

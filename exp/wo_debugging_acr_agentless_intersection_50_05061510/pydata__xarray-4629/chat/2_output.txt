I currently have the code for the `merge` function, but to further analyze the issue, I need to understand the `merge_core` function, which is used within the `merge` function and is likely where attribute handling including `combine_attrs='override'` is processed.

Let's search for the `merge_core` function in the `xarray/core/merge.py` file.

```python
search_method_in_file("xarray/core/merge.py", "merge_core")
```

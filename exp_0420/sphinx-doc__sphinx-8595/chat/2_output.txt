The error encountered in the testing script (`EOL while scanning string literal (debugging_test.py, line 24)`) indicates that there's a problem with the string literals in the script. Specifically, the string is not terminated properly, causing a syntax error.

Here's the issue in the observed code:
```python
doc_source = '''# example.py
__all__ = []

def foo():
    "docstring"

def bar():
    "docstring"

def baz():
    "docstring"
''''

index_source = '''# index.rst
.. automodule:: example
   :members:
''''
```

The string literals for `doc_source` and `index_source` have been terminated incorrectly.

To fix this, the string literals should be properly enclosed with the correct number of quotes:

```python
doc_source = '''# example.py
__all__ = []

def foo():
    "docstring"

def bar():
    "docstring"

def baz():
    "docstring"
'''

index_source = '''# index.rst
.. automodule:: example
   :members:
'''
```

I will go ahead and make the necessary changes to ensure the strings are properly terminated.

However, this is a fix in the test code and does not address the actual issue reported with the `sphinx` project. We need to identify the root cause of the bug where an empty `__all__` attribute is ignored.

The issue lies in the implementation of `sphinx.ext.autodoc` where it determines which members to include. I suspect it involves checking the `__all__` attribute.

Next, I'll observe the method responsible for identifying and including members in the documentation.

Observed method: `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:get_object_members`

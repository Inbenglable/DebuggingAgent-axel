To determine whether the issue is fixed, we need to evaluate both the patch provided and the test outputs.

### Patch Review:
The patch modifies the function `is_fits` by changing the line:
```python
return isinstance(args[0], (HDUList, TableHDU, BinTableHDU, GroupsHDU))
```
to
```python
return len(args) > 0 and isinstance(args[0], (HDUList, TableHDU, BinTableHDU, GroupsHDU))
```

This change adds a check to ensure that `args` is not empty before attempting to access `args[0]`. This prevents the `IndexError` from occurring when `args` is empty. The patch seems appropriate for addressing the specific issue of accessing elements in an empty tuple, which was causing the error.

### Test Outputs:
#### Original Output:
The original test output shows an `IndexError` as expected due to the function attempting to access `args[0]` when `args` is empty.

#### Patched Output:
The patched test output is empty, indicating that the test no longer raises an `IndexError`. The absence of errors suggests that the patch successfully prevents the `IndexError` by checking if `args` is non-empty.

### Conclusion:
The fix provided by the patch appears to correctly resolve the issue of the `IndexError` by preventing access to an empty tuple. The test execution after applying the patch does not result in any errors, indicating that the issue is fixed.

Issue resolved: `True`

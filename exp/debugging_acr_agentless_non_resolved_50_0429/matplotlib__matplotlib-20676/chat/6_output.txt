The issue lies in the initialization method `ToolLineHandles.__init__` within the `matplotlib` library. By creating lines at positions `(0, 0)`, the `SpanSelector` widget inadvertently requests an autoscale view that includes `x=0`, causing the axis limits to be expanded to encompass zero, even though it is not within the original plotting range.

These lines, created with `axvline(x=0)`, are initially placed at `x=0`, which triggers the autoscaling of the x-axis limits once the widget is initialized. Although the lines are not visible (`visible=False`), their mere presence at `x=0` influences the axes limits, coupling with how the `SpanSelector` interactivity works.

The current observed behavior suggests that the problem results from this initial placement within `ToolLineHandles.__init__`. Fixing this would involve changing the initial position setup during `SpanSelector` initialization to avoid impacting the axes when it's not necessary. Thus, the buggy method is identified:

Buggy method: `lib/matplotlib/widgets.py:ToolLineHandles.__init__`

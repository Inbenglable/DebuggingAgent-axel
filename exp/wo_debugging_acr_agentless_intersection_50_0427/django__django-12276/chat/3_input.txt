## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
FileInput shouldn't display required attribute when initial data exists.
Description
	 
		(last modified by thenewguy)
	 
I think that ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute() (â€‹https://github.com/django/django/blob/e703b93a656b78b9b444bb3a9980e305ed002a70/django/forms/widgets.py#L454) should be moved to FileInput.use_required_attribute() so that required is not output on the html input element that represents FileInput when a file is already set (e.g. already saved on a model instance that is being edited).
Maybe I am overlooking a use case where this is not desirable? I can not think of one.

</ISSUE>


You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To resolve the issue mentioned, I need to review the source code of the `ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute()` method and the `FileInput` class within which this method might be redeclared. Since the proposal is to move the method within the hierarchy, it may be important to check how these are implemented.

I'll start by examining the `use_required_attribute` method in the specified file (`django/forms/widgets.py`) and any `FileInput` class code relevant to this functionality. 

Let's search for the `use_required_attribute` method and `FileInput` class in the file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute")
search_class_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "FileInput")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute")
RESULT:
#### django/forms/widgets.py:ClearableFileInput.use_required_attribute
```python
    def use_required_attribute(self, initial):
        return super().use_required_attribute(initial) and not initial

```


### API INVOKE: search_class_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "FileInput")
RESULT:
#### django/forms/widgets.py:FileInput
```python
class FileInput(Input):
    input_type = 'file'
    needs_multipart_form = True
    template_name = 'django/forms/widgets/file.html'

    def format_value(self, value):
        ...

    def value_from_datadict(self, data, files, name):
        ...

    def value_omitted_from_data(self, data, files, name):
        ...
```


==================================================

Your Output:
To generate the patch, I need to gather the source code of the `FileInput` class as I might need to move the `use_required_attribute()` method into it, and potentially modify or override this function. Given the previous API calls have returned only the class definition without its methods, I will now retrieve the detailed implementation of the `FileInput` class.

Additionally, I will also check the existence of the `use_required_attribute()` method in the parent class `Input`, which `FileInput` inherits from, to understand its current behavior.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "Input")
```

==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_class_in_file("django/forms/widgets.py", "Input")
RESULT:
#### django/forms/widgets.py:Input
```python
class Input(Widget):
    """
    Base class for all <input> widgets.
    """
    input_type = None  # Subclasses must define this.
    template_name = 'django/forms/widgets/input.html'

    def __init__(self, attrs=None):
        ...

    def get_context(self, name, value, attrs):
        ...
```


==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

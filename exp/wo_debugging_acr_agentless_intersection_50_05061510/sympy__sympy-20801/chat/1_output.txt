To resolve the issue, I need to inspect the source code where the comparison between different sympy objects like `S(0.0)` and `S.false` is implemented. This likely involves looking at symbolic comparison mechanisms in sympy. To proceed, I will search for relevant classes or methods in the sympy codebase, specifically focusing on the part about symbolic equality or boolean operations.

Let's start by searching for the `S` object implementation and any associated comparison logic in the sympy codebase. 

```python
search_class_in_codebase("S")
search_method_in_codebase("Expr.__eq__")
```

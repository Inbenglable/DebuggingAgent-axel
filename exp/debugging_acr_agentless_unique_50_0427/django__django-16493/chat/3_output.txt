Based on the provided issue description and runtime information, the problem involves how the `FileField` class in Django initializes and manages the storage argument, particularly when it is a callable that returns a storage object like `default_storage`.

**Current Observations:**

1. **Method of Interest**: The `FileField.__init__` method is crucial because it handles the initialization of the storage attribute. The key lines are:
   - **Line 240**: The storage is set to the provided storage argument or defaulted to `default_storage`.
   - **Lines 241-244**: If the storage is a callable, it captures the callable and then evaluates it.
   - **Line 244**: This line is pivotal because it executes the callable. Once executed, it checks if the result is an instance of `Storage`.

2. **Potential Bug**:
   - If `self.storage()` returns `default_storage`, this is indistinguishable from when storage is not provided I.e., default behavior.
   - The deconstruction logic of the field might omit the storage argument when it should not, especially if the callable returns `default_storage`, leading to inconsistent migration files.

3. **Root Cause Insight**:
   - The bug might be in how the storage attribute's evaluated value is assessed during serialization, and whether it persists the callable correctly irrespective of the underlying storage.

To confirm this hypothesis, it would be beneficial to look into how Django deconstructs this field and decides what attributes to serialize.

Given the current observations of `FileField.__init__`:

I propose to further trace the deconstruction logic within the file which usually follows after initialization.

**Next Steps**:
Given the potential for an issue in serialization or deconstruction, let's focus on how the callable aspect is handled after the initialization.

To proceed, please provide observation details for the relevant serialization or deconstruction method, focusing on areas that handle the storage property.

**Deeper Observation**:
Let's examine the method or logic specific to deconstruction.

Please provide details on the deconstruction method likely contained within or around this initialization logic, which resides in the following range:

**Observed scope**: `django/db/models/fields/files.py:{a_function_span_encapsulating_the_storage_handling}`

Issue resolved: `False`

**Analysis:**

1. **Test Output Before and After the Patch:**
   - Both outputs, before and after the patch, show the same `AttributeError`, indicating that the test has failed due to a coding mistake in the test itself rather than the core bug issue being tested.
   - The error `AttributeError: module 'django.db.migrations' has no attribute 'OneToOneField'` suggests that there's an incorrect usage of `OneToOneField` within the migration definition in the test script rather than a problem with the patch.

2. **Patch Review:**
   - The patch modifies the condition in `sqlite3/schema.py` to account for `OneToOneField` fields when determining if a table overhaul is required. This is a rational modification because it addresses the specific `OperationalError` concerning unique constraints in SQLite when altering tables.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided test outputs indicate a persistent issue which is not related to the original bug concerning SQLite's handling of `OneToOneField`. Instead, the error arises before the migration operation due to incorrect test code (an attempt to use `migrations.OneToOneField` rather than `models.OneToOneField`).
   - Therefore, even if the patch might be logically sound for handling the SQLite specific issue, the test itself cannot validate this due to the oversight in its code. Consequently, the resolution of the original issue cannot be determined solely from this information.

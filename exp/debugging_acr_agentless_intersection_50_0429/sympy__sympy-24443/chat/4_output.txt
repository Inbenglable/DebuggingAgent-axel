The error occurs because the method `_check_homomorphism` is not handling permutations and their inverses correctly when verifying if the provided images define a valid homomorphism. This results in a failure to recognize relationships involving the inversion of generators, thus raising an exception.

Based on the current tracing, the error arises from the section of code specified within `_check_homomorphism`. The logic involving checking and handling inverses in permutation groups assumes that inverses can be directly compared to elements in the `images` dictionary, without properly accounting for how permutations should be handled or equating them with their original form. This mismanagement leads to incorrect validation and, subsequently, the ValueError.

Given the observations, the bug lies in this method's handling of inverses and permutations when checking if given relations are preserved under the mapping defined by `images`.

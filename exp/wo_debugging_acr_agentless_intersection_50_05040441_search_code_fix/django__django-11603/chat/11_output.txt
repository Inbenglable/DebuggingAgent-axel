The test output before and after applying the patch remains the same, with both outputs showing the error `django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet.`. This indicates that the changes made in the patch did not resolve the issue related to Django's application registry and app readiness.

Looking at the patch context, the patch only modifies the `Avg` and `Sum` classes to add `allow_distinct = True`, which aligns with the requested functionality enhancement in the issue. However, the current blocking error relates to the Django application setup in the test code, which is not being addressed by the patch. The error `Apps aren't loaded yet.` suggests that the Django environment is not appropriately initialized before defining and using models in the test, and this part of the test setup needs to be corrected independently of the patch.

Thus, the actual problem preventing tests from running successfully is not addressed by the patch provided, which means that the issue is not resolved yet.

Issue resolved: `False`

Based on the information provided and the behavior observed in the `hexbin` function, the discrepancy arises when evaluating the condition `len(acc) > mincnt` in the accumulation step for the parameter `C`.

The condition `len(acc) > mincnt` is causing issues because when `mincnt=1` and `C` is provided, it effectively means that bins with a single data point do not meet the threshold; they require at least two points to satisfy `len(acc) > mincnt`. The expected logical condition should be `len(acc) >= mincnt`.

This inconsistency appears in the step where the logic decides whether to depict NaN or a reduced result based on the accumulation's length compared to `mincnt`.

Therefore, the method and specific block of code that appear to be the root cause of this issue is:

Buggy method: `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py:Axes.hexbin`

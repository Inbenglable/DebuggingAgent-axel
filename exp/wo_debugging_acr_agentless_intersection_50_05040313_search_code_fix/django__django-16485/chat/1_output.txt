To address this issue, I need to examine the source code for the `floatformat` function in Django's codebase. This will help identify why the function is throwing a `ValueError` for the input `'0.00'`. I need to retrieve the source code for the `floatformat` method.

Since the file path for `floatformat` is not provided, I will search the method within the codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("floatformat")
```

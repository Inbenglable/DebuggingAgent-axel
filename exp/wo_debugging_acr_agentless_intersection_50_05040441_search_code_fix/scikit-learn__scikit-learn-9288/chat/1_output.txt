To resolve the issue, I need to investigate the KMeans class implementation in the scikit-learn codebase. This will help determine why the behavior differs between single-threaded and multi-threaded execution. I will begin by searching for the KMeans class and the relevant method.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("KMeans")
search_method_in_codebase("KMeans.fit")
```

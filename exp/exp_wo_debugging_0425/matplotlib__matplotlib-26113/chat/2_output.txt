In the provided issue description, it refers to specific lines in the codebase that are relevant to the handling of the `mincnt` parameter in the `hexbin` method:

- Lines dealing with `mincnt` when `C` is `None`: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/369618a25275b6d8be225b1372112f65ff8604d2/lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py#L4594
- Lines dealing with `mincnt` when `C` is not `None`: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/369618a25275b6d8be225b1372112f65ff8604d2/lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py#L4625

From the links, it can be inferred that the method in question is likely related to the `hexbin` plotting function within the `matplotlib.axes` module, specifically the handling of the `mincnt` parameter. 

To proceed, I need to inspect the surrounding source code of these lines to better understand how the `mincnt` parameter is handled in both cases. This will allow me to propose a patch that brings the `C is not None` behavior in line with `C is None` behavior.

```python
search_code_in_file("lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py", "mincnt")
```

The proposed patch attempts to add an `__iter__` method to the `Paginator` class to make it iterable, as desired in the issue description. The method is designed to iterate over `self.page_range` and yield `self.page(page_num)` for each page number.

However, upon examining the patched output, the `IndentationError: expected an indented block` error indicates that the patch was incorrectly applied, resulting in a syntax error. This error is likely due to incorrect indentation used in the patch, which violates Python's syntax rules for defining methods within a class.

Given that the patched output results in a syntax error, the issue with making `Paginator` iterable has not been resolved. The test fails to execute due to the IndentationError before it even checks for the functionality of the `__iter__` method.

Issue resolved: `False`

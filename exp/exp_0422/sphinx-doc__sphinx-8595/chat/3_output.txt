The provided script attempts to instantiate an `ModuleDocumenter` from the Sphinx `autodoc` extension with `None` as the first argument. However, we receive the following error:

```
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'env'
```

This issue suggests the program expects an instance of a class that contains an `env` attribute. This attribute is likely part of the Sphinx environment required for the `autodoc` directive to function correctly.

In Sphinx's `autodoc` system, the `ModuleDocumenter` is typically initialized with a directive argument, likely involving the Sphinx application's build environment, which would contain much more contextual information (like the `env`).

We need to find out what the directive is expecting as its arguments instead of `None`. This will lead us to the root of the issue.

Observed method: `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:ModuleDocumenter.__init__`

caplog fixture doesn't restore log level after test
From the documentation at https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.0.0/logging.html#caplog-fixture, "The log levels set are restored automatically at the end of the test".
It used to work, but looks broken in new 6.0 release. Minimal example to reproduce:

```
def test_foo(caplog):
    caplog.set_level(42)

def test_bar(caplog):
    print(caplog.handler.level)
```

It prints "0" for pytest<6, "42" after.

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
In this particular case, the issue arises because the `caplog` fixture doesn't restore the log level to its initial state after a test execution. The behavior has changed from earlier versions where this functionality worked correctly. This is evident from the failed test assertion, where the log level remains 42 instead of resetting to 0 in `test_bar`.

Based on the information provided, the issue likely relates to the internal handling of the log level state in the `caplog` fixture within the pytest codebase. More specifically, the issue occurs during teardown or state restoration between tests.

To continue diagnosing the problem, it makes sense to start by observing how the `caplog` fixture is implemented, especially how it manages and resets state between tests. This would typically involve looking into the internal functions of the `caplog` fixture.

Observed method: `src/_pytest/logging.py:_pytest.logging.LogCaptureFixture.handler`
==================================================
Based on the information provided and the runtime behavior observed, it seems that the issue is related to how the `caplog` fixture manages the log level restoration between tests. 

Currently, we observed the `LogCaptureFixture.handler` method which returns the handler object. The `level` attribute of this handler is what is being examined in the test assertions. The problem arises because the log level set in `test_foo` is not being reset before `test_bar` is executed, causing the assertion in `test_bar` to fail as it finds the log level still set to 42.

To diagnose the root cause further, I need to trace how the handler is being used and more importantly, how (and if) the log level is being reset or restored to its original state after `test_foo` completes.

Therefore, the next step involves inspecting the methods responsible for finalizing or tearing down the `caplog` fixture, particularly between test cases. The `_finalize` method looks promising given its naming convention, as it might be responsible for cleaning up or resetting state after a test.

Observed scope: `src/_pytest/logging.py:365-365` (I want to investigate further down the stack from where `handler` is defined, leading up potentially to its influence on log level change/restoration.)
==================================================
Based on the information provided and the runtime output from the `LogCaptureFixture.handler` method, it's clear that the handler's log level is not reset after the execution of the first test. The log level is set to 42 in `test_foo` and remains set in `test_bar`, causing the failure.

Analyzing the observed code:

- The method `LogCaptureFixture.handler` returns a handler object from a store managed by `_store`. The store is accessed using a specific `caplog_handler_key` which serves as the identifier for retrieving the handler object.
- The handler object returned by this method has a level attribute which remains set to the previous test's log level (42 in this case).

From the current observation, the issue seems to be in how the handler object stored in `_store` doesn’t automatically reset its log level state for every test. This suggests an absence of a teardown or state restoration mechanism for the handler itself between tests.

To locate the buggy method and code, I need to inspect how `_store` is managed with respect to test lifecycle events in pytest — particularly, how state is supposed to be restored for the handler after each test completes.

Next, I will observe how the `caplog` fixture and its associated store management mechanism finalize a test. This involves examining any methods related to teardown or reset behavior.

Observed method: `src/_pytest/logging.py:LogCaptureFixture._finalize`
==================================================
The current issue seems to be related to the fact that the `LogCaptureFixture._finalize` method is intended to restore the log levels that were potentially changed during a test execution. From the runtime information, it is evident that this method is invoked during the teardown phase, but it does not seem to restore the log level of the `caplog.handler` as expected.

Examining the code in `LogCaptureFixture._finalize`, the method iterates over `self._initial_logger_levels.items()` and restores the log levels using `logging.getLogger(logger_name).setLevel(level)`. However, this logic doesn't address restoring the level attribute of the handler associated with `caplog`. The apparent issue is that the `handler.level`, which is supposed to get reset at the end of each test, remains unaffected.

To proceed, I need to further trace how `self._initial_logger_levels` is managed and examine whether `caplog.handler` levels are being saved properly at the start of each test. We need to ensure they are set correctly back to the initial state at the end of the test. Investigating the initialization logic might also provide insight into what's missing when resetting the `caplog.handler` level.

Therefore, I will observe the code scope that pertains to the initialization and setup of the log levels managed by `caplog`, which includes how `self._initial_logger_levels` is populated and used.

Observed scope: `src/_pytest/logging.py:325-350`
==================================================
Based on the observed code and runtime information from the `LogCaptureFixture._finalize` method, we can see that although this method is ostensibly responsible for restoration of state, the log level isn't being reset for the `caplog.handler`.

Here's what can be deduced:

- The `LogCaptureFixture` class's `_initial_logger_levels` dictionary, meant to track initial log levels for restoration, doesn't seem to include the `caplog.handler` log level explicitly.
- The restore mechanism within `_finalize` iterates over a dictionary of initial logger levels, but since there's no handling of the `caplog.handler` level, it remains unchanged – thus the failed assertion in `test_bar`.

The abnormal behavior persists because the finalizing logic isn't covering the restoration of the handler’s log level effectively. The handler's log level, set in a previous test, is incorrectly influencing subsequent tests without being reset.

Therefore, the bug is likely within the `_finalize` method, which should include logic that explicitly resets the `caplog.handler.level` to its original level – the log level held before `test_foo` began.

Thus, it's likely that the `_finalize` method is indeed the buggy method containing the code that needs fixing.

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

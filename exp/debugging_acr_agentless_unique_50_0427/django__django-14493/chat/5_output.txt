To resolve the issue, I need to review the source code of the `post_process` method within the `ManifestFilesMixin` and the surrounding code that might involve the `substitutions` variable. Since I have already retrieved the `ManifestFilesMixin.post_process` method, I need to find out how the `substitutions` variable is being used in the `post_process` method. This may involve reviewing additional portions of the method or other related code for better context.

Given that the initial trace did not provide a sufficiently complete snippet of the `post_process` method to understand the handling of `substitutions`, I'm assuming that the actual method that is resulting in the error could be from a superclass or might have additional context. I will search for more surrounding code or any relevant method that contributes to the initialization or use of `substitutions`.

```python
search_class_in_file("django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py", "ManifestStaticFilesStorage")
search_class_in_file("django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py", "ManifestFilesMixin")
search_code_in_file("django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py", "substitutions")
```

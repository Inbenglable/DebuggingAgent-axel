The issue arises from the behavior of the `partitions()` function in `sympy.utilities.iterables`, which reuses the output dictionaries. This reuse leads to modifications in the yielded dictionaries affecting all subsequent iterations, which contradicts the expected behavior when using the partitions, as demonstrated by the testing code. 

The test shows that altering the first dictionary in the list results in subsequent iterations yielding the same altered dictionary, as the function yields references to the same dictionary object. The identified problem is the reuse of the `ms` dictionary in each iteration, which is updated and yielded repeatedly without being copied.

To resolve this, we need to ensure that each yielded dictionary is a new, distinct instance that doesn't carry over modifications from previous iterations.

Thus, the focus is on the `partitions` method where dictionaries are reused.

Buggy method: `sympy/utilities/iterables.py:partitions`

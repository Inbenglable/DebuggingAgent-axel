You are a PR reviewer that needs to review the patch generated by a bug repair agent and determine whether the issue is fixed or not.
This is the bug issue, which is in the **sympy** project:

sqrtdenest raises IndexError
```
>>> sqrtdenest((3 - sqrt(2)*sqrt(4 + 3*I) + 3*I)/2)

```

If an expression cannot be denested it should be returned unchanged.
IndexError fixed for sqrtdenest.
Fixes #12420 
Now if the expression can't be **denested**, it will be returned unchanged.
Old Result:
```
>>> sqrtdenest((3 - sqrt(2)*sqrt(4 + 3*I) + 3*I)/2)

```
New Result:

```
In [9]: sqrtdenest((3 - sqrt(2)*sqrt(4 + 3*I) + 3*I)/2)
Out[9]: 3/2 - sqrt(2)*sqrt(4 + 3*I)/2 + 3*I/2

Based on this issue, the testing agent has generated a reproducible test:
## REPRODUCE TEST
```
import sys
from sympy import sqrt, I
from sympy.simplify.sqrtdenest import sqrtdenest

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    expr = (3 - sqrt(2)*sqrt(4 + 3*I) + 3*I)/2
    try:
        result = sqrtdenest(expr)
        # If the issue is fixed, the result should be the same as the input expression
        assert result == expr, f"Expected {expr} but got {result}"
    except IndexError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("sqrtdenest raises IndexError") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

And this is the original output when running the test (before applying the patch):
## ORIGINAL OUTPUT

The repair agent has tried to generate a patch to fix the issue:
## PATCH CONTEXT
<PATCH_CONTEXT>
To resolve the issue with `IndexError` in the `_split_gcd` function of the `sympy` library, we should modify the `_split_gcd` function to handle empty input gracefully. Specifically, we want to check if the input list `a` is empty and return default values that indicate no splitting is possible. This will prevent the `IndexError` when `a[0]` is accessed.

Let's create the necessary search/replace format patch for this:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sympy/simplify/radsimp.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ng = a[0]\n=======\n    if not a:\n        return 1, [], []\n    g = a[0]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation:
- **SEARCH:** We're looking for the line `g = a[0]` which causes an `IndexError` if `a` is empty.
- **REPLACE:** Before accessing `a[0]`, we introduce a check for emptiness with `if not a:` and handle this by returning `(1, [], [])`. This indicates there is no meaningful gcd (using 1 as the neutral element for gcd), and both lists are empty, which aligns with not being able to split the gcd among empty inputs.
</PATCH_CONTEXT>

After applying the patch, the output of the test is:
## PATCHED OUTPUT
```

```

Now, please first review the patch and analyse the test output before and after the patch, to determine whether the issue is fixed or not.

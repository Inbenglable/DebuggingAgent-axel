To determine whether the issue is resolved, let's examine both the patch and the test output before and after applying the patch.

### Patch Analysis

The patch modifies the calculation of indentation in the `trim_docstring` function:

Original Code:
```python
indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())
```

Patched Code:
```python
indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())
```

The patch attempts to fix the problem by ignoring the first line in the `lines` list when calculating the minimum indentation. This change aligns with the suggested solution in the issue description.

### Test Output Analysis

#### Original Output
The test results in an `ImportError` related to the import statement:
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'simplify_exception'
```

This error indicates an issue unrelated to the functionality of the `trim_docstring` function itself. The error occurs because the `simplify_exception` module or function does not exist or is not defined in `django.contrib.admindocs.views`.

#### Patched Output
The output remains unchanged after applying the patch:
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'simplify_exception'
```

Since the output is identical before and after the patch, this suggests that the patch didn't address the `ImportError` issue encountered during the test execution.

### Conclusion

The actual execution of the test was hindered by an import error, and resolving this error would be necessary before evaluating whether the patch fixes the described issue. Additionally, the unchanged output indicates that the testing environment might not be correctly configured to assess the patch's effectiveness regarding the indentation problem.

Given the `ImportError` is still apparent in both outputs, we cannot definitively determine if the original problem with `trim_docstring` is resolved because the test setup itself is flawed and does not properly test the functionality described in the issue.

Issue resolved: `False`

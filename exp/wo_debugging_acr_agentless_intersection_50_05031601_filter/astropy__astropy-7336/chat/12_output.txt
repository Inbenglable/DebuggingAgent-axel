In order to generate a patch to fix the issue, I need to review the source code of the `quantity_input` method from the `astropy` codebase, as well as how the decorator processes return value annotations. From the information retrieved, it appears the problematic code is within the `astropy/units/decorators.py` file, near the handling of `wrapped_signature.return_annotation`.

I currently have the relevant code snippet:

```python
with add_enabled_equivalencies(self.equivalencies):
    return_ = wrapped_function(*func_args, **func_kwargs)
if wrapped_signature.return_annotation is not inspect.Signature.empty:
    return return_.to(wrapped_signature.return_annotation)
else:
    return return_
```

I need to ensure that I understand how this behavior is expected to work and possibly how `quantity_input` is defined elsewhere in the module.

Let's locate the complete implementation of the `quantity_input` method to proceed with the patch development.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("quantity_input")
```

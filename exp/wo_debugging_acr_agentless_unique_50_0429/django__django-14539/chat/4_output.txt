To address the issue with the `urlize` function handling HTML escaped strings and trailing punctuation incorrectly, we need to modify the handling for the unescaping and stripping of trailing punctuation. I'll adjust the code around the trimming of punctuation to correctly handle HTML escaped characters.

Here's the patch in SEARCH/REPLACE format:

```pythony
### django/utils/html.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                middle = middle[:len(stripped) - len(middle_unescaped)]
=======
                middle = middle[:len(stripped)]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the `middle` variable is correctly trimmed by taking into account the changes in length due to HTML unescaping, which should solve the issue with incorrect handling of punctuation after escaped HTML characters.

The resulting JSON representation of this patch is:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/utils/html.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                middle = middle[:len(stripped) - len(middle_unescaped)]\n=======\n                middle = middle[:len(stripped)]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

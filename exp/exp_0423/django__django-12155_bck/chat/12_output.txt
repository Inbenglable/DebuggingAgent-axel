To resolve the issue where an error occurs rendering docstrings when the first line is not empty, we will update the `trim_docstring` function in `django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py`. The change involves adjusting the calculation of indentation to skip the first line, as proposed in the issue description. Below is the patch to address the problem:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())\n=======\n        indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This edit replaces the method to calculate the minimum indentation in the `trim_docstring` function, ensuring that the indentation calculation skips the first line of the docstring, thus resolving the reported error.

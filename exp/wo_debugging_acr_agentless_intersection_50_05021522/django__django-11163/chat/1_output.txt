To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code for the `model_to_dict` function. This will allow me to assess the section of code that needs to be modified based on the issue description provided.

Since I do not currently have the file path for the `model_to_dict` function, I will search for the function within the entire Django project codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("model_to_dict")
```

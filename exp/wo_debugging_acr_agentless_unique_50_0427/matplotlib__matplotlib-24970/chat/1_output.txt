To resolve the deprecation warnings caused by NumPy 1.24 concerning out-of-bound Python integers conversion in the `matplotlib.colors` module, I need to locate the relevant portion of the source code. Specifically, the lines within the file mentioned in the warning might need adjustment.

I'll focus on these:

```python
xa[xa > self.N - 1] = self._i_over
xa[xa < 0] = self._i_under
xa[mask_bad] = self._i_bad
```

These lines are part of a method dealing with the colormap and indexed colors. I will locate and retrieve the relevant method from the `matplotlib/colors.py` file.

```python
search_code_in_file("lib/matplotlib/colors.py", "xa[xa > self.N - 1] = self._i_over")
```

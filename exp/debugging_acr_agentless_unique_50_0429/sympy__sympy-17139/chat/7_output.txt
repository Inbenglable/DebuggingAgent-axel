Based on tracing and observing the error context within `fu.py`, the issue arises from inappropriate comparisons of complex numbers in the function related to simplification steps, specifically in `TR6`. These comparisons occur in `_f`, which is a nested function within `TR6`.

### Analysis of Observations:

- **Core Issue:**
  - The line `if (rv.exp < 0) == True:` at line 504 and `if (rv.exp > max) == True:` at line 506 are comparing `rv.exp` (which can be a complex number) against real numbers. Python does not support ordering comparisons for complex numbers, which leads to the `TypeError`.

- **Code Context:**
  - `TR6` is handling properties of trigonometric expressions, potentially involving powers (`rv.exp`) which can be complex. This function is used within the simplification path (`simplify` -> `trigsimp` -> `_futrig` -> `TR6`), and the erroneous logic is triggered under these conditions.

### Pinpoint Resolution:

The faulty comparisons are found within the `_f` method nested inside `TR6` in `sympy/simplify/fu.py`. To correct this logic, adjustments for handling complex exponent values should be employed, likely avoiding direct `<` or `>` comparisons.

Given these insights:

**Buggy method:**

To address this issue, we need to implement a default permission setting for uploaded files in Django's `FileSystemStorage` class, typically located in the file handling section of Django, specifically in `django.core.files.storage`. We'll need to:

1. Verify how the current file permissions are being set in the `FileSystemStorage` class.
2. Add or modify the implementation to set a default permission of `0o644` for uploaded files if not explicitly configured.
3. Ensure that the documentation includes a note about the default permission and potential discrepancies users might experience.

To proceed with implementing this change, I need to look into the source code of `FileSystemStorage`, specifically focusing on how file permissions are currently being handled.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("FileSystemStorage")
```

To determine if the issue is resolved, let's evaluate the proposed patch and the test outputs.

### Patch Review:
The patch modifies the logic in the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file. The changes can be summarized as follows:

- The patch adds a condition to check if the object has an `__all__` attribute and whether it is a list.
- If `__all__` is a non-empty list, it filters members to include only those specified in `__all__`.
- If `__all__` is an empty list, it returns an empty list, thus respecting the empty `__all__` by not showing any members.

This update seems aligned with the expected behavior, where the `__all__` attribute should dictate what is included, and nothing should be included if it is empty.

### Test Output Analysis:

- **Original Output:** The output prior to applying the patch is empty, suggesting that all members are being incorrectly shown when `__all__` is empty.
  
- **Patched Output:** The output remains the same (empty), which implies the patch did not change the test output. 

### Conclusion:
The patched output and the original output are both empty, which denotes an inconsistency. Under the outlined expected behavior, with an empty `__all__`, no entries should be displayed. However, the reproduction didn't capture any incorrect entries being shown before and didn't capture a corrected behavior after.

Based on the provided details, there's insufficient evidence to verify the patch's effectiveness in changing the output because both outputs (pre- and post-patch) were provided as empty.

Therefore, the issue cannot be confirmed as resolved from the information given.

Issue resolved: `False`

The patch introduces error handling for `PolynomialError` in the `_eval_subs` method of the `Piecewise` class within the `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` file. This change ensures that when a `PolynomialError` is encountered, the substitution process continues without propagating the exception.

Now, let's analyze the test outputs:

1. **Original Test Output**: The test raised a `PolynomialError` with the message "Piecewise generators do not make sense". This resulted in an `AssertionError` because the test was expecting the error not to occur.

2. **Patched Test Output**: After applying the patch, the error message and `AssertionError` are the same as the original output. This indicates that the patch did not successfully prevent the `PolynomialError` from being raised during the substitution process.

The test was expected to pass without raising a `PolynomialError`, but both the original and patched outputs show that the error persists. Therefore, the issue is not resolved.

Issue resolved: `False`

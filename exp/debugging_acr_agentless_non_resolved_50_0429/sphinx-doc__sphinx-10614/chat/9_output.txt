Based on the current analysis, the issue seems to be related to the incorrect URLs being generated for SVG diagrams when embedded in HTML files outside of the root directory. The runtime information indicates that the URLs dictionary passed to `InheritanceGraph.generate_dot` is unexpectedly empty, suggesting that the method responsible for populating these URLs is not functioning correctly.

In `InheritanceGraph._import_classes`, the method deals with importing classes necessary for the inheritance diagram but does not directly involve path resolution or URL construction. Thus, the problem is likely upstream from this method.

The observation suggests that the issue might lie in how URLs are initialized or calculated. Therefore, the next logical step is to trace the section of the code or method responsible for setting or populating the URLs based on the directory context where the document resides.

Let's examine the initialization and construction of URLs within the `sphinx.ext.inheritance_diagram`, particularly in areas involving class references and module paths, which might reveal the source of incorrect relative paths.

Observed method: `sphinx/ext/inheritance_diagram.py:InheritanceGraph.get_all_class_names`

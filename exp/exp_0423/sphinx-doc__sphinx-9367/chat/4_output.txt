Based on the current analysis, the issue arises from the improper handling during the unparsing of 1-element tuples, as the trailing comma is being omitted. Given the current state of the program, it suggests that the problem may lie within the `_UnparseVisitor` class, particularly in how tuples are visited and processed. The `unparse` method calls `_UnparseVisitor(code).visit(node)`, which processes the AST nodes.

To locate the exact source of the issue, itâ€™s important to analyze the implementation of `_UnparseVisitor` and how it handles tuples, especially 1-element tuples.

To proceed with the investigation, I need to analyze the `_UnparseVisitor` class to see how tuple nodes are handled.

Observed scope: `sphinx/pycode/ast.py:class _UnparseVisitor`

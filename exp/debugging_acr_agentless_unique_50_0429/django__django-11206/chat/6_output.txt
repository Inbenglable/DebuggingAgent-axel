To address the issue effectively, I need to retrieve the source code of the `format` method located in `django/utils/numberformat.py` since it contains the logic handling number formatting and unexpected exponential notation for small decimals.

Let's proceed by retrieving the source code of the `format` method from the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/utils/numberformat.py", "format")
```

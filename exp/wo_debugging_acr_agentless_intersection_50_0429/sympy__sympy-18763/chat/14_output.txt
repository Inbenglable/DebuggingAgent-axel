I have obtained the source code for the `_print_Subs` method in `sympy/printing/latex.py`, which is responsible for generating the LaTeX representation of `Subs` expressions. This method currently lacks the appropriate parenthesizing for the expression part of the `Subs`. I believe additional parentheses should be added to handle this issue.

I have all the necessary information to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`

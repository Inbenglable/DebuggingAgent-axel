To resolve the issue, I need to locate and gather the source code for the `load_disk` method in the `django.db.migrations.loader.MigrationLoader` class. 

I'll proceed to find the source code for this method to understand where and how to apply the changes.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("MigrationLoader.load_disk")
```

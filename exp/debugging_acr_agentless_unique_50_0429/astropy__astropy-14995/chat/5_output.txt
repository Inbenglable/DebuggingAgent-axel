The retrieved source code for the method `NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic_mask` shows how the masks are handled during arithmetic operations. The bug arises because the method does not correctly handle cases where one of the masks is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to perform a bitwise OR with `None`.

I have enough information to make a correction to the code to ensure that if one operand's mask is `None`, the method should directly return a deep copy of the existing mask instead of attempting the `handle_mask` operation.

Ready generation: `True`

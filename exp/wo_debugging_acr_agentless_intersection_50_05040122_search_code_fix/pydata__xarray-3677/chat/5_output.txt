The patch modifies the `Dataset.merge` method in the xarray library to check if the object being merged is a `DataArray`. If it is, it converts the `DataArray` into a `Dataset` using the `to_dataset()` method before proceeding with the merge. This change addresses the issue described, where the `ds.merge(da)` call was failing because the method was not equipped to handle `DataArray` objects directly.

Here's the breakdown of the test outputs:
- **Original Output**: The test fails with an `AttributeError` because the `DataArray` object does not have an `items` method.
- **Patched Output**: The test runs successfully and prints the expected merged dataset without any exceptions, indicating that the merge operation is now working as intended.

Since the `AttributeError` is no longer occurring and the merge operation produces the expected result, it indicates that the issue has been properly addressed.

Issue resolved: `True`

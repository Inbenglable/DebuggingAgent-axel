To address the issue, we need to obtain the code of the `post_process` method in the base class, which seems to have been omitted in the API call results or may belong to `ManifestStaticFilesStorage`. This is necessary to understand where the `substitutions` variable is being utilized and how to ensure its initialization before use.

Let's retrieve the source code for the `post_process` method that is presumably referenced in the traceback for `staticfiles.storage.StaticFilesStorage`, which might be the base class.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py", "post_process")
search_class_in_file("django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py", "ManifestStaticFilesStorage")
search_class_in_file("django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py", "StaticFilesStorage")
```

Based on the information provided and the source code for the `kahane_simplify` function, we notice that the issue likely arises from how the leading gamma matrices are reinserted into the expression. Since we have the complete source code of `kahane_simplify`, we can proceed to generate a patch to fix the bug by addressing the reverse order reinsertion of the gamma matrices.

Ready generation: `True`

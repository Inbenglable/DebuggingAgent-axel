Based on the retrieved source code of the `_sparse_fit` method, it's clear that the `ZeroDivisionError` occurs due to division by zero in `dual_coef_indptr` calculation when the `support_vectors_` attribute is empty. To address this issue, we should add a check to handle the scenario where `n_SV` is zero, which results in zero support vectors.

Before proceeding with generating the patch, it's important to ensure that necessary checks and adjustments are part of the `_sparse_fit` implementation. As we have the complete source code of the `_sparse_fit` method, we can generate the patch by adding a condition to prevent division by zero when `support_vectors_` is empty.

Ready generation: `True`

Before I can create a patch, I need to analyze how the `dataset_merge_method` and `merge_core` functions are implemented, as they are directly related to the issue reported. 

I'll start by retrieving the source code for these methods to gain a comprehensive understanding of their behavior and interactions, especially how they handle `DataArray` and `Dataset` objects during the merge operation.

```python
search_method_in_file("xarray/core/merge.py", "dataset_merge_method")
search_method_in_file("xarray/core/merge.py", "merge_core")
```

To address the issue described, we need to modify the return statement in the method located in `sklearn/metrics/cluster/supervised.py` such that the risk of runtime warnings due to large integer calculations is mitigated. We will apply the proposed fix by breaking down the calculations and avoiding large intermediate results.

Here is the search/replace patch:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### sklearn/metrics/cluster/supervised.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    return tk / np.sqrt(pk * qk) if tk != 0. else 0.\n=======\n    return np.sqrt(tk / pk) * np.sqrt(tk / qk) if tk != 0. else 0.\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
``` 

This change applies the suggested fix, replacing the original computation with a method that is less likely to overflow in intermediate steps by splitting the square root calculations for each individual quotient. This should preserve the intended result and maintain numerical stability.

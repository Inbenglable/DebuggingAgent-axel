To address the issue with an empty `__all__` attribute being ignored, we need to focus on how Sphinx's autodoc handles or processes the `__all__` attribute. The relevant code would likely be involved in the autodoc extension processing or mocking related to the `__all__` usage within modules.

Let's analyze the retrieved code snippets:

1. **tests/test_ext_autodoc_events.py:89-95** - Deals with events related to autodoc and includes a function (`autodoc_skip_member`) hinting at skipping members based on their inclusion in `__all__`.
   
2. **tests/roots/test-root/autodoc_target.py:1-7** - Appears to use `__all__`, but is part of testing materials and might not directly relate to the implementation needed to fix the issue.

3. **tests/roots/test-ext-viewcode/spam/mod3.py:1-3** - Similar to the above, uses `__all__` in a test setup, which might not directly relate to the issue fixing.

4. **tests/roots/test-ext-autodoc/target/empty_all.py:1-7** - Specifically deals with an empty `__all__`, likely mirrors the issue described, helpful for testing whether a fix works.

5. **sphinx/util/inspect.py:155-161** - Looks to have utility functions related to extracting `__all__` and could be relevant as it directly checks the validity of `__all__`.

6. **sphinx/ext/autodoc/mock.py:83-89** - Contains a class where `__all__` is used as a class attribute, potentially part of mocking that might be relevant in autodoc. 

7. **sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:1109-1115** - Directly deals with sorting or processing based on `__all__`, which might be at the core of autodoc functionality handling `__all__`.

For resolving the issue regarding the empty `__all__`, we should focus primarily on how the autodoc extension processes inclusions or exclusions. Thus, the relevant snippets to look into further are from the actual autodoc implementation and any test setups that mirror the described issue:

1. **sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:1109-1115** - Directly affects how documenters are sorted based on `__all__`.

2. **sphinx/util/inspect.py:155-161** - Inspects `__all__` and has logic related to checking its integrity, directly affecting how it is processed.

3. **sphinx/ext/autodoc/mock.py:83-89** - Might be relevant for mocked behavior regarding `__all__`.

Therefore, the needed contents are:

```
sphinx/util/inspect.py:155-161
sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:1109-1115
sphinx/ext/autodoc/mock.py:83-89
```

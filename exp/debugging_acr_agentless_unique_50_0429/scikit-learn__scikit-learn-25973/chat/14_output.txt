To determine whether the issue has been resolved, let's go through the steps:

### Patch Details
1. **Patch Modification**:
   - The patch attempts to address the issue by converting the `cv` parameter from an iterable or generator to a list when passed to `cross_val_score`. This ensures that the iterable isn't exhausted during its use.
   - Modification made in the file `sklearn/feature_selection/_sequential.py` to handle the case where `cv` is an iterable.

### Test Output Analysis
1. **Before Patch**:
   - The original test output displayed an `IndexError: list index out of range`. This indicates the generator `splits` was exhausted, preventing successful iteration.

2. **After Patch**:
   - The test output after applying the patch is identical to the original output: `IndexError: list index out of range`.
   - This suggests the patch didn't resolve the issue, as the same exception occurs before and after the attempted fix.

### Conclusion
It appears that converting `cv` to a list using the patch did not rectify the issue since the `IndexError` persists. Thus, the patch did not resolve the problem.

**Issue resolved**: `False`

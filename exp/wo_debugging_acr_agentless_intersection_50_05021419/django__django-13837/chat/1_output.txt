Given the issue, the primary task involves modifying the `django.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments` method to handle cases where Python is launched with `-m` for any package. In order to make the necessary changes, I need to obtain the source code for the `get_child_arguments` method.

Since I haven't been provided with the file path for this method, I'll start by searching for it in the entire codebase.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("get_child_arguments")
```

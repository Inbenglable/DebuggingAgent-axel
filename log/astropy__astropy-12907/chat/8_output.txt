We will modify the `_cstack` method to preserve the separability of independently nested models by:

1. Ensuring that we preserve the identity of separability between nested components and properly concatenate their separability matrices.

Next, we'll update the `_separable` function if necessary, to ensure it appropriately uses the improved `_cstack`.

Let's proceed:

### PATCH

#### Patch for `astropy/modeling/separable.py`

```pythony
### astropy/modeling/separable.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    cright = np.zeros((noutp, right.shape[1]))
    cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = 1
=======
    cright = np.zeros((noutp, right.shape[1]))
    cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = right
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

And here is the final JSON with the search and replace edits:

```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### astropy/modeling/separable.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    cright = np.zeros((noutp, right.shape[1]))\n    cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = 1\n=======\n    cright = np.zeros((noutp, right.shape[1]))\n    cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = right\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"
  ]
}
```

This change ensures that `_cstack` correctly patches the separability matrix of the right-hand side compound model, allowing the nested structure to retain its logical separability.

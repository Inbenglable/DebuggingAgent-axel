<ISSUE>
utils.numberformat.format renders small decimals in exponential notation.
Description
	
When using utils.number_format with decimal_pos, extremely small numbers get displayed using exponential notation.
>>> from django.utils.numberformat import format as nformat
>>> nformat(Decimal('1e-199'), '.', decimal_pos=2)
'0.00'
>>> nformat(Decimal('1e-200'), '.', decimal_pos=2)
'1.00e-200'
This is caused by a hardcoded cut-off point in the internal logic, but I would argue that when a decimal_pos argument is supplied and the number to be formatted is smaller in absolute size than what can be encoded using the provided number of decimal positions, the returned string should be 0.0000...000 instead.

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
The issue arises because the `nformat` method in `django.utils.numberformat` is attempting to access the Django settings before they have been configured. This is apparent from the `ImproperlyConfigured` exception that suggests settings are not configured and highlights the line where the settings are accessed.

The stack trace shows that this issue occurs in the `format` method of the `django.utils.numberformat` module:

```
use_grouping = (use_l10n or (use_l10n is None and settings.USE_L10N)) and settings.USE_THOUSAND_SEPARATOR
```

The code attempts to use `settings.USE_L10N` and `settings.USE_THOUSAND_SEPARATOR`, and since settings are not yet configured, it results in an error.

To proceed, I will analyze the `format` method in more detail to assess its logic and determine what changes need to be made to handle very small decimals correctly without relying on unconfigured settings.

Observed method: `django/utils/numberformat.py:format`
==================================================
The current issue is caused by attempting to access Django settings before they're configured, which leads to an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception. This occurs because the `format` method checks for `settings.USE_L10N` and `settings.USE_THOUSAND_SEPARATOR` before the Django settings module has been properly initialized.

Analyzing the code, the relevant problematic lines in the `format` method are:

```python
21    use_grouping = (use_l10n or (use_l10n is None and settings.USE_L10N)) and settings.USE_THOUSAND_SEPARATOR
22    use_grouping = use_grouping or force_grouping
23    use_grouping = use_grouping and grouping != 0
```

These lines rely on the assumption that Django settings are already set up.

The method also formats very small numbers using exponential notation by default, as indicated by:

```python
30: if isinstance(number, Decimal):
31:    # Format values with more than 200 digits (an arbitrary cutoff) using
32:    # scientific notation to avoid high memory usage in {:f}'.format().
33:    _, digits, exponent = number.as_tuple()
34:    if abs(exponent) + len(digits) > 200:
35:        number = '{:e}'.format(number)
```

The arbitrary cutoff of 200 digits compels very small numbers (`Decimal('1e-200')` and smaller) to be formatted using scientific notation, which is not desired for this particular use case when `decimal_pos` is specified.

### Steps Forward
- We need to refactor the logic that deals with formatting numbers and potentially force the formatting of very small decimals as simple zero strings when `decimal_pos` is defined.
- Review the logic that determines when scientific notation should be used.
- Adjust the method to not depend on Django settings if they're not configured.

To dive deeper into the logic, especially concerning handling extremely small decimals, we'll further inspect lines concerning the formatting decision and handling decimals:

Observed scope: `django/utils/numberformat.py:29-41` 

We'll look closely at how it formats numbers based on their decimal representation and scientific notation conditions.
==================================================
The abnormal program behavior is due to the `nformat` function's reliance on Django settings, which haven't been configured in the test setup. Specifically, this happens in the observed code:
```python
21    use_grouping = (use_l10n or (use_l10n is None and settings.USE_L10N)) and settings.USE_THOUSAND_SEPARATOR
```
This line attempts to access `USE_L10N` and `USE_THOUSAND_SEPARATOR` from the settings before they're initialized, leading to an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception. The formatting of small decimals in exponential notation is due to the code logic that applies formatting conditions with hard-coded cutoffs, as seen in:

```python
33    if abs(exponent) + len(digits) > 200:
34        number = '{:e}'.format(number)
```

Given this analysis, the buggy behavior is twofold:
1. The improper configuration of Django settings.
2. Formatting logic handling small decimals using arbitrary cut-off logic for exponential formatting.

To isolate the problem strictly related to unexpected exponential formatting of small decimals, a refactor targeting the hard-coded cutoff logic is necessary. Additionally, ensuring test environments adequately configure Django settings can prevent `ImproperlyConfigured` issues.

Now, since we already have a focus on the handling logic, let's verify the format's dependency on settings further and how the decimal position influences formatting. We can continue by observing the setup of number formatting and its conditions:

**Observed method**: `django/conf/__init__.py:_setup`
==================================================
The problem arises because the `LazySettings._setup` method is attempting to access Django settings without them being properly configured, leading to an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception. The code tries to fetch `USE_L10N` from the settings, which is expected, but since the settings are not set up, it results in an error.

The error stack trace indicates the following call sequence:
1. `format` in `django.utils.numberformat.py` accesses settings that are not configured.
2. `_setup` method in `django.conf.__init__.py` raises `ImproperlyConfigured`.

Given the observation, the root cause is the dependency on uninitialized settings. However, the specific issue within `format` relates to how it handles small decimals and its decision to format them using scientific notation.

To fix the issue, both the logic within the `format` method responsible for exponential formatting and the settings access problem need to be addressed. 

Since the setup of settings is clearly understood, the next step is directly analyzing the logic that causes very small numbers to be returned in exponential notation when `decimal_pos` is specified.

Let's continue to trace within the `format` method:
 
Observed scope: `django/utils/numberformat.py:33-41`  
This scope concerns how the `format` method handles very small decimal formatting decisions. Let's inspect this to understand where the cutoff logic is applied.
==================================================
The abnormal program behavior is caused by two main issues related to the `nformat()` function:

1. **Improper Configuration of Django Settings**:
   The behavior is primarily due to an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception when accessing Django settings in the number formatting logic. The stack trace shows that the problem arises within the `format` function in `django/utils/numberformat.py`, which attempts to access settings like `USE_L10N` without being properly initialized as shown in this line:
   ```python
   use_grouping = (use_l10n or (use_l10n is None and settings.USE_L10N)) and settings.USE_THOUSAND_SEPARATOR
   ```
   This accesses Django settings without them being configured properly, which is evident from the error message suggesting that the settings need to be initialized before use.

2. **Handling of Small Decimals**:
   The function `nformat()` is also formatting small decimal values like `Decimal('1e-200')` using exponential notation due to an arbitrary cutoff for the number of digits beyond which it formats using scientific notation:
   ```python
   if abs(exponent) + len(digits) > 200:
       number = '{:e}'.format(number)
   ```
   This logic causes small decimals to be formatted in a way that's unexpected and incorrect when `decimal_pos` is specified.

Based on the current analysis, the primary buggy behavior concerning the issue of small decimals is within the formatting logic that handles small numbers, checking for a cutoff point of digit length to switch to scientific notation.

### Conclusion:
The buggy method and potential point of refactoring needed to handle the unexpected exponential notation correctly lies in:

Buggy method: `django/utils/numberformat.py:format`

The solution involves addressing the reliance on improperly configured settings and revising the decimal formatting logic to respect the `decimal_pos` argument for very small decimals without resorting to scientific notation inappropriately.

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

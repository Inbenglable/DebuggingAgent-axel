## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
docutils reports an error rendering view docstring when the first line is not empty
Description
	
Currently admindoc works correctly only with docstrings where the first line is empty, and all Django docstrings are formatted in this way.
However usually the docstring text starts at the first line, e.g.:
def test():
	"""test tests something.
	"""
and this cause an error:
Error in "default-role" directive:
no content permitted.
.. default-role:: cmsreference
The culprit is this code in trim_docstring:
indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())
The problem is that the indentation of the first line is 0.
The solution is to skip the first line:
indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())
Thanks.

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
To fix the issue explained, we need to make changes in the `trim_docstring` function. Before generating a patch, I need to retrieve the source code of this function for analysis. If the file path of the function is not provided, I will search for the method in the codebase as the next logical step. 

Let's proceed with retrieving the source code for `trim_docstring`.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("trim_docstring")
```
==================================================
Your API invoke result:

### API INVOKE: search_method_in_codebase("trim_docstring")
RESULT:
#### django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py:trim_docstring
```python
def trim_docstring(docstring):
    """
    Uniformly trim leading/trailing whitespace from docstrings.

    Based on https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/#handling-docstring-indentation
    """
    if not docstring or not docstring.strip():
        return ''
    # Convert tabs to spaces and split into lines
    lines = docstring.expandtabs().splitlines()
    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())
    trimmed = [lines[0].lstrip()] + [line[indent:].rstrip() for line in lines[1:]]
    return "\n".join(trimmed).strip()

```


==================================================

Your Output:
Given the source code for the `trim_docstring` function, we have identified the issue within the function itself. The proposed solution is to adjust the logic so that the indentation calculation excludes the first line of the docstring. Since the content of `trim_docstring` was already provided, we have enough information to generate the patch.

Ready generation: `True`
==================================================

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

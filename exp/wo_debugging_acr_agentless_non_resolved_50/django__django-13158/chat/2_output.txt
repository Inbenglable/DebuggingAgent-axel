Based on the information retrieved about `QuerySet.union`, `ModelMultipleChoiceField`, and `QuerySet.none`, I have enough details to diagnose the problem. The issue seems to arise when using the `union()` method on QuerySets in the context of form submission with `ModelMultipleChoiceField`. The `union()` operation may not properly handle cases where no selections are made, leading to incorrect query results during form saving.

The retrievals show both the method handling for `union()` and the foundational behavior of `ModelMultipleChoiceField`, along with `QuerySet.none` that should ideally return an empty queryset. These foundational details are sufficient to generate a patch for addressing the issue in Django's handling of combined queries using `union()`.

Ready generation: `True`

To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code for methods in the `django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py` file, where the client interaction code with PostgreSQL likely resides. I have yet to determine the specific method(s) to modify, so I'll search for all methods in this file first to identify the relevant ones.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py", "runshell")
```

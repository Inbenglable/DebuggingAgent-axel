To generate the patch for this issue, I need to review the implementation of the `validate` method in the `ModelChoiceField` class, as this is likely where the validation error is raised due to an invalid choice. By understanding this method, I can modify the error message to include the invalid value. Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code for the `validate` method.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/forms/models.py", "ModelChoiceField.validate")
```

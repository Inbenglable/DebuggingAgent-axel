Based on the retrieved information, the `FileSystemStorage` class seems to be responsible for managing file storage in Django, and the `save` method delegates to the `_save` method for saving files. To address the issue, we need to check how file permissions are set in the `_save` method within the `FileSystemStorage` class.

Since the `_save` method's source code is not yet retrieved, I need to obtain the source code for this method to determine how to set a default file permission of `0o644`.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/core/files/storage.py", "_save")
```

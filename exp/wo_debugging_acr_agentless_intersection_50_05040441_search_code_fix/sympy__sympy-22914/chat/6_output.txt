The patch attempts to add `_print_Min` and `_print_Max` methods to handle Python code generation for the `Min` and `Max` functions in the `PythonCodePrinter` class. However, the patched output indicates a syntax error:

```
IndentationError: expected an indented block
```

This error suggests that there is an issue with indentation in the patch. Therefore, while the patch aims to resolve the issue, it introduces a new syntax error due to incorrect indentation, preventing successful execution of the test.

Given this outcome, the issue is not fixed correctly since the patch fails to run without errors.

Issue resolved: `False`

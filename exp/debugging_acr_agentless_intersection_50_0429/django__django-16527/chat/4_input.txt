## ISSUE
<ISSUE>
"show_save_as_new" in admin can add without this permission
Description
	 
		(last modified by Mariusz Felisiak)
	 
At "django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py" file, line 102, I think you must put one more verification for this tag: "and has_add_permission", because "save_as_new" is a add modification.
I rewrite this for my project:
			"show_save_as_new": not is_popup
			and has_add_permission # This line that I put!!!
			and has_change_permission
			and change
			and save_as,

</ISSUE>


A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
Based on the issue description and the test results, the problem appears to lie in the handling of the `show_save_as_new` context variable within the `submit_row` function. Specifically, the concern is that `show_save_as_new` is being shown even if the user does not have the `has_add_permission`.

The test script is indicating a failure in the first test case, which aligns with the problem described: the "Save as new" option should not be shown if the user does not have add permission.

Given this information, we need to examine the logic that determines the `show_save_as_new` value. From the initial code:

```python
"show_save_as_new": not is_popup
and has_change_permission
and change
and save_as
```

This logic does not currently include a check for `has_add_permission`, which seems to be causing the problem. The fix, as suggested by the issue reporter, would involve adding this check.

Therefore, the method directly related to this issue is the `submit_row` function. We need to analyze its content and logic to make sure it uses the permissions correctly.

Now, you need to generate patches to resolve the issue. Please ensure that your patch does not disrupt the original functionality of the code.
You should generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* format patches to fix the issue.
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
```pythony
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You should finally provide edit result in the following JSON format (each {SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT} is a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit):
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_1}",
    "{SEARCH_REPLACE_EDIT_2}",
  ]
}

A final json reply example:
```json
{
  "search_replace_edits": [
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       def foo():\n=======\n    def bar():\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "### A/B.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH
       x = x + 1\n=======\n    x = x - 1\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
}
```

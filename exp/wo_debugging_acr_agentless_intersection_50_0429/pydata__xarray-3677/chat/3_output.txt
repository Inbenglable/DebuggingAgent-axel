Looking at the issue, it stems from the `ds.merge()` method in the `xarray.core.dataset` module not handling `DataArray` objects appropriately. The functionality should align with the top-level `merge()` function, which already handles both `Dataset` and `DataArray` objects.

Having accessed the `merge` and `dataset_merge_method` methods, the next task is to ensure the `ds.merge()` method within `Dataset.merge` is capable of recognizing and adapting when a `DataArray` type is passed, in the same manner as when a `Dataset` is the argument.

To achieve this, it's necessary to investigate how the top-level `merge` function manages these types. Thus, checking for the `merge` function implementation in the `merge.py` file would give insights into handling this discrepancy.

```python
search_method_in_file("xarray/core/merge.py", "merge")
```

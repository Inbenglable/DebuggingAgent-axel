To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code for the method `ImmutableDenseNDimArray._new`. This should allow me to confirm the current code and apply the necessary changes to address the bug regarding the handling of rank-0 arrays. I will now proceed to search for the method within the specified file.

```python
search_method_in_file("sympy/tensor/array/dense_ndim_array.py", "ImmutableDenseNDimArray._new")
```

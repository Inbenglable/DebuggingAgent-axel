Based on the information provided, let's review the patch and analyze the test outputs:

1. **Original Issue**: 
   - The `add_fields` method caused a `TypeError` when `index` was `None` because of the statement `index < initial_form_count`.
   - The original output shows this `TypeError` occurring precisely due to comparison between `NoneType` and `int`.

2. **Patch**:
   - The proposed fix changes the logic in the `add_fields` method by adding a check to ensure `index` is not `None` before performing the comparison with `initial_form_count`.
   - The new condition is: 
     ```python
     if self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or (index is not None and index < initial_form_count)):
     ```
   - This ensures that comparison is only made if `index` is not `None`, which should prevent the `TypeError`.

3. **Test Outputs**:
   - **Original Output**: The test fails with a `TypeError` exactly where the bug was described, which matches the reproduction steps.
   - **Patched Output**: After applying the patch, the test does not produce a `TypeError`. Instead, it correctly generates the form output and confirms that "The issue is fixed."

Given the review of the patch applied and the change in behavior of the test output from failing due to a `TypeError` to succeeding without errors:

Issue resolved: `True`

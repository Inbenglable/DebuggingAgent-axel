The current issue is related to the erroneous usage of an attribute in the test script used to reproduce the problem where adding a nullable `OneToOneField` causes an error in SQLite. Specifically, the following abnormalities are observed:

1. **ImportError**: The script tries to use `migrations.OneToOneField`, which results in an `AttributeError` because there is no such attribute in `django.db.migrations`. Instead, it should be using `models.OneToOneField` to define fields in a migration.

The error in the migration class definition indicates a misunderstanding or typo in using Django's ORM APIs.

Given these observations, the likely location for this error is not within the Django source code itself but within the test script provided (`reproduce.py`). We'll need to correct the import and usage to properly test for the original SQLite issue.

Buggy method: `reproduce.py:Migration`

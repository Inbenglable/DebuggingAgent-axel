The patch tried to address the issue by replacing the private `_subs` method calls in the `Piecewise` class within `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` with the public `subs` method. The intention was to enhance the substitution process, possibly improving handling for assumptions or specific expression types.

However, when evaluating the test outputs before and after the patch application, we observe the following:

1. **Original Output:** The test throws a `PolynomialError` due to `Piecewise generators do not make sense`, resulting in an assertion error indicating the issue still exists.

2. **Patched Output:** The test again results in the same `PolynomialError` for `Piecewise generators do not make sense`, followed by an assertion error indicating that the issue remains unresolved.

The patch did not prevent the `PolynomialError` from being raised, which means the issue with `subs()` method handling expressions involving hyperbolic functions and piecewise conditions with real assumptions persists. Therefore, the patch did not successfully fix the issue.

Issue resolved: `False`

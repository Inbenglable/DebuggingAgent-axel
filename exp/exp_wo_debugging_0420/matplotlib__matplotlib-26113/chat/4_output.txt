To address the inconsistent behavior of the `mincnt` parameter in the hexbin method when the `C` parameter is supplied, I need to first examine the relevant code sections in the Matplotlib project codebase. The relevant lines are mentioned in the issue report:

1. The lines that deal with `mincnt` when `C` is `None`: 
   - File: `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py`
   - Starting line: 4594

2. The lines that deal with `mincnt` when `C` is not `None`: 
   - File: `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py`
   - Starting line: 4625

To better understand the current implementation, I will retrieve the code around these lines. 

```python
search_code_in_file("lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py", "len(vals) > mincnt")
search_code_in_file("lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py", "len(vals) >= mincnt")
```

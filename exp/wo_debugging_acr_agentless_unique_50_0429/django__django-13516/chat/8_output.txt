Based on the issue description and the `MigrationExecutor.migrate` method's logic, I need to understand how the migration management command uses `flush()` to manage the output streams (stdout/stderr) during the migration execution. Specifically, I need to look for the source code of the management command responsible for handling migrations and verify how output flushing is managed within it.

To find the relevant source code, I will search for the `migrate` management command, typically found in the Django core management commands directory.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("flush")
search_method_in_codebase("Command.handle")
search_method_in_file("django/core/management/commands/migrate.py", "flush")
```

The patch made changes to handle functions like `exp`, `log`, and trigonometric functions ensuring that the dimension of their arguments is dimensionless and returning a dimensionless `Dimension(1)` for those function results. However, the issue now is that the patched code is raising a `NameError` because `exp` (and potentially other functions like `log`) is not defined in the scope of `UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension`.

In the original output, the test raised a `ValueError` due to the `exp` function being called with a non-dimensionless argument. This behavior was intended, but the test also expects the issue to be resolved and for no exceptions to be thrown, meaning that the patched logic should handle this check without resulting in an error during actual intended use cases.

The `NameError` in the patched output indicates that the names for functions such as `exp` are not available in the patched method's scope. This is likely because these functions were not imported or defined directly in the scope of the patch. To resolve this new error, the patch would need to ensure that these functions are correctly imported or accessible in the method's scope, and then properly check dimensions without resulting in errors.

Until this error is resolved correctly, the issue cannot be considered fixed, as the currently patched code does not produce the expected behavior with respect to dimension checking.

Issue resolved: `False`

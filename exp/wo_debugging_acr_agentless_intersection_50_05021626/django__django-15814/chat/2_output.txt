Before generating the patch, I need to understand the context surrounding line 748 where `opts = cur_model._meta` is located and see the rest of the relevant code within the method or function to ensure I modify it correctly.

Let's find out the enclosing method or function around the line we retrieved, in order to obtain the complete source code of that part of the file.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/db/models/sql/query.py", "opts = cur_model._meta")
```

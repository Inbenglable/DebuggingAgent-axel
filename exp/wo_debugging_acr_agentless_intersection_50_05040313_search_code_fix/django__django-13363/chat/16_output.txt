To determine whether the issue is fixed, we need to analyze the patch and the test outputs before and after applying the patch:

### Patch Analysis
The patch updates the `as_sql` method for both `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` functions. The change involves using the `tzinfo` parameter passed to these functions when generating SQL, instead of unconditionally using the result of `timezone.get_current_timezone_name()`. This change is consistent with the requirement to allow different timezone information.

### Original Test Output
The original test output shows an error indicating "no such table: __main___timeslots." This implies a problem with database table creation or connection, preventing the test from checking the issue directly.

### Patched Test Output
The patched test output remains unchanged, again showing "no such table: __main___timeslots." This indicates that the test environment still has the same setup issue, preventing the patch from being properly tested.

### Conclusion
Since the test outputs show that the issue is related to the database table not being available, we cannot measure the effectiveness of the patch based solely on the test outputs provided. The test needs to be adjusted so that the `TimeSlots` table is properly created and accessible before the patch's effect can be accurately evaluated. Therefore, without resolving the setup issue, we cannot determine whether the patch fixes the original problem.

Issue resolved: `False`

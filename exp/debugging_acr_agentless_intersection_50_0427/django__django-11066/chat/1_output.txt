From the provided script execution and error message, we can see that there is a problem with Django's environment setup, specifically the configuration of Django settings.

The error `django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: Requested setting INSTALLED_APPS, but settings are not configured` suggests that Django's settings have not been properly initialized before importing models or running the tests. The testing script tries to patch and invoke Django's `RenameContentType` class's `_rename` method without having a Django application context fully set up.

To resolve the issue, make sure Django's settings are properly configured with a call to `django.setup()` after setting the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable pointing to a valid settings module. Additionally, verify if importing `ContentType` or any other Django models occurs after the settings have been configured correctly.

However, the underlying problem, according to the issued description, asks for changes in how the `save` method is called, ensuring that it operates on the correct database by adding the parameter `using=db`.

Based on both the provided code and the abnormal program behavior, we need to further investigate `_rename` method in `RenameContentType` to confirm how the database is being handled based on the given database alias.

Observed method: `django/contrib/contenttypes/management/__init__.py:RenameContentType._rename`

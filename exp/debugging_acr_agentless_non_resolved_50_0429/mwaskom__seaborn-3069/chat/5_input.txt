Nominal scale should be drawn the same way as categorical scales
Three distinctive things happen on the categorical axis in seaborn's categorical plots:

1. The scale is drawn to +/- 0.5 from the first and last tick, rather than using the normal margin logic
2. A grid is not shown, even when it otherwise would be with the active style
3. If on the y axis, the axis is inverted

It probably makes sense to have `so.Nominal` scales (including inferred ones) do this too. Some comments on implementation:

1. This is actually trickier than you'd think; I may have posted an issue over in matplotlib about this at one point, or just discussed on their gitter. I believe the suggested approach is to add an invisible artist with sticky edges and set the margin to 0. Feels like a hack! I might have looked into setting the sticky edges _on the spine artist_ at one point?

2. Probably straightforward to do in `Plotter._finalize_figure`. Always a good idea? How do we defer to the theme if the user wants to force a grid? Should the grid be something that is set in the scale object itself

3. Probably straightforward to implement but I am not exactly sure where would be best.

A debugging agent has tried to trace the abnormal program and locate the root cause of the bug. This is its debugging history:

==================================================
Based on the information and traceback provided, the issue described in the test seems to be originating from the behavior of `catplot` when a nominal scale is used. The main error occurs in the `check_nominal_scale_behavior` function, which expects the nominal scale to have tick marks positioned at `-0.5` and `len(data['category']) - 0.5`, which is not happening.

The test code shows that it uses `sns.catplot` to create a bar plot and then inspects the x-axis ticks and limits, expecting them to have some offset (`+/- 0.5`) beyond the first and last category. This is the current area of failure, represented by the `AssertionError`.

The error trace leads us to the `seaborn.categorical.catplot` method, and specifically, the logic behind nominal scale handling when using a categorical plot type. This indicates that the approach in this method, or the objects involved (like `_CategoricalPlotter`), might be where the discrepancy occurs with how seaborn's categorical plots handle scale drawing.

Therefore, I will focus on the `catplot` functionality further and the corresponding plotting mechanisms, particularly `_BarPlotter` given its explicit use in the trace.

Observed method: `seaborn/categorical.py:_BarPlotter`
==================================================
From the analysis of the issue and the runtime information provided for the `_BarPlotter` class in `seaborn/categorical.py`, the problem seems to revolve around how the nominal scales are managed when generating categorical plots using Seaborn. Specifically:

1. **Tick Mark Positioning**: The test indicates a failure due to the nominal scale not drawing tick marks to `-0.5` from the first tick and `len(data['category']) - 0.5` from the last tick. This implies that the adjustment of tick locations (expansion to `-0.5` and `+0.5` margins) isn't being applied.

2. **Initialization in `_BarPlotter`**: The `_BarPlotter.__init__` method sets up the plot without specific accommodation for nominal scale adjustments in tick positioning which could be causing this issue.

3. **Categorical Axis Adjustments**: The `_finalize_figure` needs to explicitly handle the limits for the axes when the nominal scale is used. This might not be occurring correctly or at all in the current implementation.

Given this understanding, it's likely that the adjustments for nominal scales need to be applied somewhere dealing with axis limits or during the drawing process within these plotting helper methods.

To proceed, I will focus on exploring how the plotter finalizes the figure in terms of axis limits specifically for nominal scales. This involves delving into the `_finalize_figure` method of the `Plotter` class that may include or interact with any scale settings or configurations.

Observed scope: `seaborn/_core/plot.py:_finalize_figure` 

Please provide information on the `_finalize_figure` process or the relevant section in the plot code handling axis setups for categorical plotting.
==================================================
The analysis of the runtime behavior and the code in `Plotter._finalize_figure` indicates:

- The expected behavior for nominal scales includes adjusting the axis limits to be drawn to +/- 0.5 from the first and last tick. This behavior is expected to be implemented when handling string-type values for axis limits in lines 1638-1645.

- The runtime warning indicates that the layout has changed to tight; however, no explicit issue is noted with the layout itself relating to grid visibility, and the focus remains on the failure to adjust tick positioning.

- The error trace suggests that an `AssertionError` arises from the expected tick positions not matching due to inadequate adjustments after the axis limits are calculated, likely because the limits aren't correctly incorporating the offsets for nominal scales when set.

Based on this, the adjustments for nominal scales in tick positioning seem to be inadequately handled in this method. Specifically, the logic or method handling axis limits and tick positions needs closer inspection beyond what the current runtime analysis shows.

Since the logic responsible for handling nominal scale adjustments in `_finalize_figure` is already within our observation, and no clear correction was made, the root cause likely resides here.

Thus, the buggy method can be identified based on the misuse or lack of effective use of unit conversion and tick limit setting.

Buggy method: `seaborn/_core/plot.py:_finalize_figure`
==================================================

You have called API to retrieve some code and this is your API call and reply history:
==================================================
Your Output:
Based on the analysis, we need to understand how the `Plotter._finalize_figure` method is currently implemented to properly address the issue. 

Since the issue is observed in the `_finalize_figure` method and potentially within the `Plotter` class concerning the axis setup, we need to retrieve the source code of both the `Plotter` class and the `_finalize_figure` method to ensure comprehensive understanding of the current logic.

I'll proceed to retrieve the relevant code.

==================================================

Based on these information, you need to think about how to resolve the issue and fix the bug.
Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then you have two options. (Choose only one of them):

## IF GENERATE PATCH
If you've gathered enough code to generate the patch, stop invoking the search APIs.
At this point, instead of invoking function call, please reply with:
Ready generation: `True` 

## IF YOU NEED TO RETRIEVE SOURCE CODE
If you need to know any more source code to help you generate the patch, use the search APIs to retrieve code.
You can use the following APIs to search source code.
1. `search_method_in_file(file_path: str, method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the specified file.
2. `search_method_in_codebase(method_name: str)`: Search for the method in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the method, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_method_in_file` API.
3. `search_class_in_file(file_path: str, class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the specified file.
4. `search_class_in_codebase(class_name: str)`: Search for the class code in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the class, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_class_in_file` API.
5. `search_code_in_file(file_path: str, code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the specified file, return its surrounding code.
6. `search_code_in_codebase(code: str)`: Search for a code snippet in the whole project codebase. Only if you don't know the file path of the code, this API should be used. Otherwise, you should use the `search_code_in_file` API.


You should finally reply in the following format:
```python
search_method_in_file("FILE_PATH", "METHOD_NAME")
search_class_in_file("FILE_PATH", "CLASS_NAME")
search_code_in_file("FILE_PATH", "SOME_CODE")
search_method_in_codebase("METHOD_NAME")
...
```
Note the format should obeys the following rules:
1. Enclose all API calls in a single python code block (i.e., start with ```python, followed by the API calls, then close the block with ```).
2. You may invoke any of these APIs as many times as needed, including not at all.
3. The file path is relative to the repository.
4. All arguments must be enclosed in double quotes and the number of arguments must be correct.
5. If the method you want to search belongs to a class, it is recommended specify the class name and method name in the format of `ClassName.method_name` as METHOD_NAME. Otherwise multiple methods with the same name (but in different classes) may be returned.


Now, please first analyze whether you need to retrieve any source code or if you're ready to generate the patch. Note that before generating a patch for a method, you must first obtain its source code.
Then choose one of the two options above and follow the format to reply.

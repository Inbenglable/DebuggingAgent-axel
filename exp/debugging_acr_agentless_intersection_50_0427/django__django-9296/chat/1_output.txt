The issue observed is that the `MockPaginator` object is not iterable, resulting in a `TypeError`. This error is hitting because the `Paginator` class upon which `MockPaginator` is based does not implement the `__iter__` method. The request in this issue is to implement an `__iter__` method in the `Paginator` class, which allows it to be directly iterable over its pages, following a more Pythonic convention.

Based on the test script, the intent is to iterate over the pages of the paginator. The error confirms that currently, the `Paginator` class does not support iteration directly as this functionality has not been defined.

As specified in the issue description, the suggested implementation for an `__iter__` function within the `Paginator` class is to yield page objects in a loop iterating over `self.page_range`.

To locate the method where changes should be made, it's likely within the `Paginator` class. Therefore, I need to investigate the `Paginator` class for the exact spot where to integrate this new feature.

Observed method: `django/core/paginator.py:Paginator.__init__`

To address the issue where `timesince()` raises a `TypeError` with `USE_TZ=True` and a datetime object interval of more than one month, we need to review the implementation of the `timesince` method in the `timesince.py` file, especially around where the pivot datetime object is instantiated. 

Given the reference in the issue description, the relevant code is located at:
```
django/utils/timesince.py
```

We need to retrieve the implementation of `timesince` in this file to understand how the timezone information is being handled. As such, I'll proceed to search for the `timesince` method in `django/utils/timesince.py`.

```python
search_method_in_file("django/utils/timesince.py", "timesince")
```

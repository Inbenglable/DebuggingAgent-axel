The current implementation of the `separability_matrix` function relies heavily on the `_separable` function, which is likely a utility or helper function responsible for determining separability. To resolve the issue, understanding this helper function will likely be crucial.

Therefore, I need to retrieve the source code for the `_separable` function or any related code that might impact separability logic.

```python
search_method_in_file("astropy/modeling/separable.py", "_separable")
```

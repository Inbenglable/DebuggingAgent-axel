To determine the relevance of each piece of code returned by the API, I need to consider their context and relationship with the issue described.

1. **sympy/plotting/intervalmath/lib_interval.py:sinh**:
   - This implementation seems to handle interval evaluations, specifically for the hyperbolic sine function using `numpy`. The issue doesn't mention intervals or `numpy` integration, so this might not be needed for the particular issue described.

2. **sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py:sinh**:
   - This is the implementation of the `sinh` function within the Sympy library itself. The issue stems from using `sinh` within `Piecewise` expressions and encountering a `PolynomialError`. The implementation of `sinh` in Sympy directly impacts the behavior in the expression discussed, making this content relevant to understanding potential internal operations or assumptions that affect the error.

Based on this analysis, the relevant content to investigate further regarding the issue is:

```
sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py:sinh
```

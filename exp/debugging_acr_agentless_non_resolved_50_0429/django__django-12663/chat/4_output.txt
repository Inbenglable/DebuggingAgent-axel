### Analysis of Current Code and Abnormal Program Behavior

#### Current Observed Code
The observed code is responsible for preparing field values before they are stored in the database. The critical lines here attempt to convert the provided value into an integer using `int(value)`. If the value does not directly support integer conversion, a `TypeError` or `ValueError` will be raised, which is likely linked to the issue with `SimpleLazyObject`.

#### Abnormal Program Behavior
The error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'test_app'` indicates that the test environment is not correctly set up. This prevents the test case from running, and hence, we cannot reach the point where the original `TypeError` related to `SimpleLazyObject` arises.

### Conclusion
- The test setup error is blocking further tracing of the original bug related to `SimpleLazyObject`.
- We need to ensure that the `test_app` module is available so the test can proceed and reach the stage where the `TypeError` occurs.

### Next Steps

Since the current issue is with the test setup, I'll focus on resolving this to allow proper execution of the test case. This involves creating or correctly configuring the `test_app` module.

Once the setup issue is resolved, we can re-run the test and observe the behavior that leads to the `TypeError` during query operations involving `SimpleLazyObject`.

For now, I will focus on fixing the setup issue. Only after this can I further locate the buggy code responsible for handling the `SimpleLazyObject`.

**Action Needed:** Ensure the presence of `test_app` module in the setup.

If the setup issue is resolved, the next logical step is to further trace the methods responsible for handling `SimpleLazyObject` and integer conversion. This may involve exploring methods in Django's query processing that interact with field values, subqueries, or annotations. 

However, based on the current need to resolve the setup issue, no additional method can be observed immediately.

**Resolution Needed:** Create and configure the `test_app` module properly.

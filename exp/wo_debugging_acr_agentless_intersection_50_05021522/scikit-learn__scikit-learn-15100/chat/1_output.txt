To address the issue with the `strip_accents_unicode` function, I need to inspect its implementation. The function is mentioned in conjunction with `CountVectorizer` from the `sklearn.feature_extraction.text` module, which suggests where its source code might be located. 

Let's retrieve the source code for the `strip_accents_unicode` method.

```python
search_method_in_codebase("strip_accents_unicode")
```

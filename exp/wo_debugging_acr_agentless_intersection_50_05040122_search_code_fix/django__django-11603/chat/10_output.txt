Let's analyze the provided information:

### Test Output Analysis

**Original Output**: 
- The error message is `django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet.`
- This issue occurs before any test method is invoked. It indicates that the Django application registry hasn't been loaded properly before defining models or running tests.

**Patched Output**: 
- The output is exactly the same as the original: `django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet.`
- The patch made changes to the handling of `Avg` and `Sum` aggregates but didn't address the issue causing the AppRegistryNotReady exception.

### Patch Review

The patch introduces `allow_distinct = True` to the `Avg` and `Sum` classes to support DISTINCT in aggregation queries. This was a step towards addressing the original issue of adding DISTINCT support for these aggregates.

However, the core problem encountered in the test setup (`AppRegistryNotReady`) wasn't related to the DISTINCT attribute of aggregates but rather a misconfiguration in initializing Django settings and applications for the test.

### Conclusion

Despite the patch potentially contributing to resolving the stated issue if the test setup were working correctly, the test never progressed far enough to evaluate DISTINCT support due to `AppRegistryNotReady`. Thus, the issue in question regarding DISTINCT support was neither tested nor resolved based on the current test configuration.

**Issue resolved: `False`**

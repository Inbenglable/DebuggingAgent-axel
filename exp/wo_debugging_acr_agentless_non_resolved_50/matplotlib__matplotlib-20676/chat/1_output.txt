To address the issue, we need to inspect the `SpanSelector` class to determine where the x-axis limits are being modified when the `interactive` parameter is set to `True`. We aim to ensure the axes limits remain at `(10, 20) + margins`. Since we don't have the exact file location of the `SpanSelector` class, we first need to retrieve the class source code. I will search for the `SpanSelector` class code in the codebase.

```python
search_class_in_codebase("SpanSelector")
```

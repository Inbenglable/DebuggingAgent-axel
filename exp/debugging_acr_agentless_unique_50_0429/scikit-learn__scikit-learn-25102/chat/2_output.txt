Given the current observation, the process for wrapping data in a pandas DataFrame does not include any mechanism to preserve the original dtypes of the input data. The observed behavior clearly indicates that dtypes are not being preservedâ€”it converts `np.float16` to `np.float64`, which is the default dtype for floating-point numbers in pandas. The code line to trace deeper is where the transformation into pandas occurs within `_wrap_data_with_container`.

The call to `_wrap_in_pandas_container` at line 130 in `sklearn/utils/_set_output.py` is not preserving the dtypes. To fix this issue, we may need to modify `_wrap_in_pandas_container` to support dtype preservation.

To trace further, let's examine the implementation of `_wrap_in_pandas_container`.

Observed scope: `sklearn/utils/_set_output.py:130-134`

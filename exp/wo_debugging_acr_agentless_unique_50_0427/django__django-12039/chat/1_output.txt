To resolve the issue, I need to retrieve the source code related to the creation of index statements in Django. As mentioned, the problem lies within the function or mechanism that generates the `CREATE INDEX` statement, particularly within the `ddl_references.py` file at line 87. Therefore, I need to find the relevant method and code around that line to understand how indices are being created and to determine where the whitespace adjustment needs to be made.

Let's start by finding the relevant code related to index creation.

```python
search_code_in_file("django/db/backends/ddl_references.py", "Columns")
search_code_in_file("django/db/backends/ddl_references.py", "col_suffixes")
```

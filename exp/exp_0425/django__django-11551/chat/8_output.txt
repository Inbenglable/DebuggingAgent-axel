To determine whether the patch resolves the issue, we must analyze both the change in the code and the test outputs:

### Patch Analysis:
The patch modifies the `_check_list_display_item` method by removing the reliance on `hasattr` for deciding whether to attempt to acquire fields via `model._meta.get_field`. The patch ensures that `model._meta.get_field(item)` is tried regardless of `hasattr` being true or false, which was meant to handle fields only accessible via instances correctly. The logic matches the suggested adjustments from the issue description.

### Test Output Analysis:
**Original Output:**
- The test fails with a `ModuleNotFoundError` because the module `'test_app'` does not exist. This entirely prevents the test from running, not reaching the patch logic execution.

**Patched Output:**
- The output remains the same as the original, showing a `ModuleNotFoundError` due to the non-existence of `'test_app'`. Therefore, the test still does not run, and the patch's logic has not been executed or verified through the test.

### Decision:
The test failed at the setup stage both before and after the patch due to the missing `'test_app'` module. Without the test running correctly, we cannot ascertain if the patch actually resolves the issue. Additionally, there is no change between the original and patched output which indicates that the underlying problem remains untested.

Issue resolved: `False`
